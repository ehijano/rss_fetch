      <title>TOI-1685 b is a Hot Rocky Super-Earth: Updates to the Stellar and Planet Parameters of a Popular JWST Cycle 2 Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated characterization of the TOI-1685 planetary system, which consists of a P$_{\rm{b}}$ = 0.69\,day USP super-Earth planet orbiting a nearby ($d$ = 37.6\,pc) M2.5V star (TIC 28900646, 2MASS J04342248+4302148). This planet was previously featured in two contemporaneous discovery papers, but the best-fit planet mass, radius, and bulk density values were discrepant allowing it to be interpreted either as a hot, bare rock or a 50\% H$_{2}$O / 50\% MgSiO$_{3}$ water world. TOI-1685 b will be observed in three independent JWST cycle two programs, two of which assume the planet is a water world while the third assumes that it is a hot rocky planet. Here we include a refined stellar classification with a focus on addressing the host star's metallicity, an updated planet radius measurement that includes two sectors of TESS data and multi-color photometry from a variety of ground-based facilities, and a more accurate dynamical mass measurement from a combined CARMENES, IRD, and MAROON-X radial velocity data set. We find that the star is very metal-rich ([Fe/H] $\simeq$ +0.3) and that the planet is systematically smaller, lower mass, and higher density than initially reported, with new best-fit parameters of \Rpl = 1.468 $^{+0.050}_{-0.051}$ \Rearth\ and \Mpl = 3.03$^{+0.33}_{-0.32}$ \Mearth. These results fall in between the previously derived values and suggest that TOI-1685 b is a hot, rocky, planet with an Earth-like density (\Rhopl = 5.3 $\pm$ 0.8 g cm$^{-3}$, or 0.96 \rhoearth), high equilibrium temperature (T$_{\rm{eq}}$ = 1062 $\pm$ 27 K) and negligible volatiles, rather than a water world.</description>

      <title>Confirmation and Characterization of the Eccentric, Warm Jupiter TIC 393818343 b with a Network of Citizen Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified over 7,000 candidate exoplanets via the transit method, with gas giants among the most readily detected due to their large radii. Even so, long intervals between TESS observations for much of the sky lead to candidates for which only a single transit is detected in one TESS sector, leaving those candidate exoplanets with unconstrained orbital periods. Here, we confirm the planetary nature of TIC 393818343 b, originally identified via a single TESS transit, using radial velocity data and ground-based photometric observations from citizen scientists with the Unistellar Network and Exoplanet Watch. We determine a period of $P$ = 16.24921 $\substack{+0.00010 \\ -0.00011}$ days, a mass $M_{P}$ = 4.34 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_{J}$, and semi-major axis $a$ = 0.1291 $\substack{+0.0021 \\ -0.0022}$ au, placing TIC 393818343 b in the "warm Jupiter" population of exoplanets. With an eccentricity $e$ = 0.6058 $\pm$ 0.0023, TIC 393818343 b is the most eccentric warm Jupiter to be discovered by TESS orbiting less than 0.15 au from its host star and therefore an excellent candidate for follow-up, as it may inform our future understanding of how hot and warm Jupiter populations are linked.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 superbolide over the Iberian Peninsula: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 93.0$\pm$0.8 cm, with a density of 1613$\pm$12 kg\,m$^{-3}$, entering the atmosphere at 40.1$\pm$0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$ with an angle of 10.93$\pm$0.02$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 137.88$\pm$0.05 km and ended at an altitude of 53.78$\pm$0.07 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit was characterized by an inclination of 14.42$\pm$0.23$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.950$\pm$0.004, a semi-major axis of 2.31$\pm$0.13 au, and a notably short perihelion distance of 0.116$\pm$0.003 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Government (USG) space sensors. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 1.6$^\circ$ and -0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravitational Dynamics Within the Inner Oort Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the Inner Oort Cloud (IOC) - a vast halo of icy bodies residing far beyond Neptune's orbit - is an expected outcome of the solar system's primordial evolution within a stellar cluster. Recent models have shown that the process of early planetesimal capture within the trans-Neptunian region may have been sufficiently high for the cumulative mass of the Cloud to approach several Earth masses. In light of this, here we examine the dynamical evolution of the IOC, driven by its own self-gravity. We show that the collective gravitational potential of the IOC is adequately approximated by the Miyamoto-Nagai model, and use a semi-analytic framework to demonstrate that the resulting secular oscillations are akin to the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai resonance. We verify our results with direct $N$-body calculations, and examine the effects of IOC self-gravity on the long-term behavior of the solar system's minor bodies using a detailed simulation. Cumulatively, we find that while the modulation of perihelion distances and inclinations can occur within an observationally relevant range, the associated timescales vastly surpass the age of the sun, indicating that the influence of IOC self-gravity on the architecture of the solar system is negligible.</description>

      <title>Using Asteroseismology to Calibrate the Physical Parameters of Confirmed Exoplanets and Their Evolved Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology offers a profound window into stellar interiors and has emerged as a pivotal technique in exoplanetary research. This study harnesses the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations to reveal, for the first time, the asteroseismic oscillations of four exoplanet-hosting stars. Through meticulous analysis, we extracted their asteroseismic signatures, enabling the precise determination of stellar masses, radii, luminosities, and surface gravities. These parameters exhibit markedly reduced uncertainties compared to those derived from spectroscopic methods. Crucially, the exoplanets orbiting these stars were initially identified via radial velocity measurements. The refinement of host stellar masses necessitates a corresponding adjustment in planetary characteristics. Employing asteroseismology, we recalibrated the exoplanets' minimum masses and semi-major axes - a novel approach in the field. For instance, the exoplanet HD 5608 b's minimum mass, denoted as Msini, was ascertained to be 1.421 +/- 0.091 M_J through the integration of asteroseismic and radial velocity data. Similarly, two planets within the 7 CMa system yielded Msini values of 1.940 +/- 0.064 MJ and 0.912 +/- 0.067 M_J, respectively. Two planets in HD 33844 system presented Msini figures of 1.726 +/- 0.145 M_J and 1.541 +/- 0.182 M_J, while the HIP 67851 system's planets registered Msini at 1.243 +/- 0.139 M_J and a notably higher 5.387 +/- 0.699 M_J. This investigation extends beyond mere parameter refinement; it underscores the synergy between asteroseismology and exoplanetology, yielding unprecedented precision in system metrics. Focusing on quartet of K-type giants in advanced evolutionary phases, our work positions these systems as invaluable astrophysical laboratories, offering insights into the potential trajectory of our own solar system's fate.</description>

      <title>Blowin' in the non-isothermal wind: core-powered mass loss with hydrodynamic radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass loss rates of planets undergoing core-powered escape are usually modeled using an isothermal Parker-type wind at the equilibrium temperature, $T_\mathrm{eq}$. However, the upper atmospheres of sub-Neptunes may not be isothermal if there are significant differences between the opacity to incident visible and outgoing infrared radiation. We model bolometrically-driven escape using aiolos, a hydrodynamic radiative-transfer code that incorporates double-gray opacities, to investigate the process's dependence on the visible-to-infrared opacity ratio, $\gamma$. For a value of $\gamma \approx 1$, we find that the resulting mass loss rates are well-approximated by a Parker-type wind with an isothermal temperature $T = T_\mathrm{eq}/2^{1/4}$. However, we show that over a range of physically plausible values of $\gamma$, the mass loss rates can vary by orders of magnitude, ranging from $10^{-5} \times$ the isothermal rate for low $\gamma$ to $10^5 \times$ the isothermal rate for high $\gamma$. The differences in mass loss rates are largest for small planet radii, while for large planet radii, mass loss rates become nearly independent of $\gamma$ and approach the isothermal approximation. We incorporate these opacity-dependent mass loss rates into a self-consistent planetary mass and energy evolution model and show that lower/higher $\gamma$ values lead to more/less hydrogen being retained after core-powered mass loss. In some cases, the choice of opacities determines whether or not a planet can retain a significant primordial hydrogen atmosphere. The dependence of escape rate on the opacity ratio may allow atmospheric escape observations to directly constrain a planet's opacities and therefore its atmospheric composition.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dust activity of naked-eye comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A morphological and photometric analysis of the naked-eye long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) before perihelion is presented in this study. The observation images taken by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey telescope from July 2022 to October 2022 show a gradually brightening dust coma and a tail with a clear structure. The morphology of the dust coma reveals nonsteady-state emission with an ejection velocity lower than 14 m s$^{-1}$ for particles larger than 100 um. According to the syndyne-synchrone analysis, dust particles larger than about 10 um contribute significantly to the observed tail. The model simulations of the 10 October 2022 image suggest that the radii of large particles lingering near the nucleus range from 0.1 mm to 1 mm. Assuming that the nucleus of comet E3 is a homogeneous sphere with an albedo of 0.1, the photometry analysis sets the lower and upper limits of the nucleus radius to be $0.81\pm0.07$ km and $2.79\pm0.01$ km, respectively. The dust production rates increased continuously from $241\pm3$ kg s$^{-1}$ in July to $476\pm9$ kg s$^{-1}$ in October. The dependence of the ejection velocity $v_{\perp}$ perpendicular to the orbital plane of comet E3 on the particle size $a$ can be simplified as $v_{\perp}\propto a^{-1/2}$, which indicates that the dust emission is likely driven by gas. The water-production rate is inferred as $\sim 368\pm72$ kg s$^{-1}$ in October 2022, which is sustained by an equilibrium-sublimating area of $8.2\times10^6$ m$^2$ at least. The comparative analysis of the characteristics of comet E3 with those of comets belonging to different types shows that the activity profile of long-period comet E3 surprisingly aligns more closely with those of short-period comets within a heliocentric distance range of about [1.7, 3.4] AU, where the images of comet E3 that we used in this study were taken.</description>

      <title>Planet-driven spirals in protoplanetary discs: limitations of the semi-analytical theory for observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting protoplanets during their formation stage is an important but elusive goal of modern astronomy. Kinematic detections via the spiral wakes in the gaseous disc are a promising avenue to achieve this goal. We aim to test the applicability to observations in the low and intermediate planet mass regimes of a commonly used semi-analytical model for planet induced spiral waves. In contrast with previous works which proposed to use the semi-analytical model to interpret observations, in this study we analyse for the first time both the structure of the velocity and density perturbations. We run a set of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations and compare them with the output of the semi-analytic model in the code wakeflow, which is obtained by solving Burgers' equation using the simulations as an initial condition. We find that the velocity field derived from the analytic theory is discontinuous at the interface between the linear and nonlinear regions. After 0.2 r$_p$ from the planet, the behaviour of the velocity field closely follows that of the density perturbations. In the low mass limit, the analytical model is in qualitative agreement with the simulations, although it underestimates the azimuthal width and the amplitude of the perturbations, predicting a stronger decay but a slower azimuthal advance of the shock fronts. In the intermediate regime, the discrepancy increases, resulting in a different pitch angle between the spirals of the simulations and the analytic model. The implementation of a fitting procedure based on the minimisation of intensity residuals is bound to fail due to the deviation in pitch angle between the analytic model and the simulations. In order to apply this model to observations, it needs to be revisited accounting also for higher planet masses.</description>

      <title>Background Contamination of the Project Hephaistos Dyson Spheres Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project Hephaistos recently identified seven M-dwarfs as possible Dyson Spheres (DS) candidates. We have cross-matched three of these candidates (A, B \&amp; G) with radio sources detected in various all-sky surveys. The radio sources are offset from the Gaia stellar positions by $\sim 4.9$, $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 5.0$ arcseconds for candidates A, B, and G respectively. We propose that DOGs (Dust obscured galaxies) lying close to the line-of-sight of these M-dwarf stars significantly contribute to the measured WISE mid-IR flux densities in the WISE W3 and W4 wavebands. These three stars have therefore been misidentified as DS candidates. We also note that with an areal sky density of $9 \times 10^{-6}$ per square arcsecond, Hot DOGs can probably account for the contamination of all 7 DS candidates drawn from an original sample of 5 million stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain measurements in celestial mechanics necessitate having the origin O of a Cartesian coordinate system (CCS) coincide with a point mass. For the two and three body problems we show mathematical inadequacies in Newton's celestial mechanics equations (NCME) when the origin of a coordinate system coincides with a point mass. A certain system of equations of relative differences implied by NCME is free of these inadequacies and is invariant with respect to any CCS translation. A new constant of motion is derived for the relative system. It shows that the universe of relative differences of the $N$-body problem is ``restless''.</description>

      <title>Setting the stage for the search for life with the Habitable Worlds Observatory: Properties of 164 promising planet survey targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020) has recommended that NASA realize a large IR/O/UV space telescope optimized for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of ~25 exo-Earths and transformative general astrophysics. The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) has subsequently released a list of 164 nearby (d&lt;25 pc) targets deemed the most accessible to survey for potentially habitable exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We present a catalog of system properties for the 164 ExEP targets, including 1744 abundance measurements for 14 elements from the Hypatia Catalog and 924 photometry measurements spanning from 151.6 nm to 22 {\mu}m in the GALEX, Str\"omgren, Tycho, Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE bandpasses. We independently derive stellar properties for these systems by modeling their spectral energy distributions with Bayesian model averaging. Additionally, by consulting the literature, we identify TESS flare rates for 46 stars, optical variability for 78 stars, and X-ray emission for 46 stars in our sample. We discuss our catalog in the context of planet habitability and draw attention to key gaps in our knowledge where precursor science can help to inform HWO mission design trade studies in the near future. Notably, only 33 of the 164 stars in our sample have reliable space-based UV measurements, and only 40 have a mid-IR measurement. We also find that phosphorus, a bio-essential element, has only been measured in 11 of these stars, motivating future abundance surveys. Our catalog is publicly available and we advocate for its use in future studies of promising HWO targets.</description>

      <title>Radial and vertical constraints on the icy origin of H$_{2}$CO in the HD 163296 Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: H$_2$CO is a small organic molecule widely detected in protoplanetary disks. As a precursor to grain-surface formation of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO is considered an important precursor of O-bearing organic molecules that are locked in ices. Still, since gas-phase reactions can also form H$_2$CO, there remains an open question on the channels by which organics form in disks, and how much the grain versus the gas pathways impact the overall organic reservoir. We present spectrally and spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of several ortho- and para-H$_2$CO transitions toward the bright protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. We derive column density, excitation temperature, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) radial profiles for H$_2$CO, as well as disk-averaged values of $N_{\mathrm{T}}\sim4\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, $T_{\mathrm{ex}}\sim20$ K, and $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$, respectively. We empirically determine the vertical structure of the emission, finding vertical heights of $z/r\sim0.1$. From the profiles, we find a relatively constant $\mathrm{OPR}\sim2.7$ with radius, but still consistent with $3.0$ among the uncertainties, a secondary increase of $N_{\mathrm{T}}$ in the outer disk, and low $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ values that decrease with disk radius. Our resulting radial, vertical, and OPR constraints suggest an increased UV penetration beyond the dust millimeter edge, consistent with an icy origin but also with cold gas-phase chemistry. This Herbig disk contrasts previous results for the T Tauri disk, TW Hya, which had a larger contribution from cold gas-phase chemistry. More observations of other sources are needed to disentangle the dominant formation pathway of H$_2$CO in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The TESS-Keck Survey XX: 15 New TESS Planets and a Uniform RV Analysis of all Survey Targets</title>

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new worlds, with TESS planet candidates now outnumbering the total number of confirmed planets from $\textit{Kepler}$. Owing to differences in survey design, TESS continues to provide planets that are better suited for subsequent follow-up studies, including mass measurement through radial velocity (RV) observations, compared to Kepler targets. In this work, we present the TESS-Keck Survey's (TKS) Mass Catalog: a uniform analysis of all TKS RV survey data which has resulted in mass constraints for 126 planets and candidate signals. This includes 58 mass measurements that have reached $\geq5\sigma$ precision. We confirm or validate 32 new planets from the TESS mission either by significant mass measurement (15) or statistical validation (17), and we find no evidence of likely false positives among our entire sample. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished TKS survey data, including 9,204 RV measurements and associated activity indicators over our three year survey. We took the opportunity to assess the performance of our survey, and found that we achieved many of our goals including measuring the mass of 38 small ($&lt;4R_{\oplus}$) planets, nearly achieving the TESS mission's basic science requirement. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the Automated Planet Finder (APF) as survey support and observed meaningful constraints on system parameters due to its more uniform phase coverage. Finally, we compared our measured masses to those predicted by commonly used mass-radius relations and investigated evidence of systematic bias.</description>

      <title>Dynamic regimes in planetary cores: {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary cores are the seat of rich and complex fluid dynamics, in which the effects of rotation and magnetic field combine. The equilibria governing the strength of the magnetic field produced by the dynamo effect, the organisation and amplitude of the flow, and those of the density field, remain debated despite remarkable progress made in their numerical simulation. This paper proposes a new approach based on the explicit consideration of the variation of time scales {\tau} with spatial scales {\ell} for the different physical phenomena involved. The {\tau}-{\ell} diagrams thus constructed constitute a very complete graphic summary of the dynamics of the object under study. We highlight the role of the available convective power in controlling this dynamics, together with the relevant force balance, for which we derive a very telling {\tau}-{\ell} translation. Several scenarios are constructed and discussed for the Earth's core, shedding new light on the width of convective columns and on the force equilibria to be considered. A QG-MAC scenario adapted from Aubert [2019] gives a good account of the observations. A diversion to Venus reveals the subtlety and relativity of the notion of 'fast rotator'. We discuss scaling laws and their validity domain, and illustrate 'path strategies'. A complete toolbox is provided, allowing everyone to construct a {\tau}-{\ell} diagram of a numerical simulation, a laboratory experiment, a theory, or a natural object.
