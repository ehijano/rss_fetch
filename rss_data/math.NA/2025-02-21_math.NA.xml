      <title>Retraction maps: A seed of geometric integrators. Part II: Symmetry and reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use retraction and discretization maps (see [Barbero Li\~n\'an and Mart\'in de Diego, 2022]) as a tool for deriving in a systematic way numerical integrators preserving geometric structures (such as symplecticity or Lie-Poisson structure), as well as methods that preserve symmetry and the associated discrete momentum map. The classical notion of a retraction map leads to the notion of discretization map extended here to the Lie algebroid of a Lie groupoid so that the configuration manifold is discretized, instead of the equations of motion. As a consequence, geometric integrators are obtained preserving the Lie-Poisson structure of the corresponding reduced system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational inequalities play a pivotal role in a wide array of scientific and engineering applications. This project presents two techniques for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the context of variational inequalities, with a specific focus on the classical obstacle problem.
  We propose two distinct AMR strategies: Variable Coefficient Elliptic Smoothing (VCES) and Unstructured Dilation Operator (UDO). VCES uses a nodal active set indicator function as the initial iterate to a time-dependent heat equation problem. Solving a single step of this problem has the effect of smoothing the indicator about the free boundary. We threshold this smoothed indicator function to identify elements near the free boundary. Key parameters such as timestep and threshold values significantly influence the efficacy of this method.
  The second strategy, UDO, focuses on the discrete identification of elements adjacent to the free boundary, employing a graph-based approach to mark neighboring elements for refinement. This technique resembles the dilation morphological operation in image processing, but tailored for unstructured meshes.
  We also examine the theory of variational inequalities, the convergence behavior of finite element solutions, and implementation in the Firedrake finite element library. Convergence analysis reveals that accurate free boundary estimation is pivotal for solver performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in dynamically enhancing mesh resolution around free boundaries, thereby improving the convergence rates and computational efficiency of variational inequality solvers. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing Firedrake numerical solvers, and it is promising for solving more complex free boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Stochastic Block Projection Algorithm for Solving Linear Systems under Predefined Communication Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed computation over networks is now receiving an increasing attention in many fields such as engineering and machine learning, where the solution of a linear system of equations is a basic task. This paper presents an asynchronous distributed randomized block Kaczmarz projection algorithm for solving large-scale linear systems over a multi-agent networks, where each agent only holds a part of the problem data. An event-triggered communication mechanism is integrated to minimize the communication overhead and reduce the overall communication costs. This communication mechanism allows each agent to update independently in an asynchronous environment and dynamically regulate communication frequency. In addition, this article analyzes the inefficiency caused by communication in asynchronous algorithms, explores the potential of event triggering mechanisms in alleviating these problems, and provides general conditions for global convergence in such environments. Moreover, a modified stochastic block Kaczmarz algorithm is used for each agent to update their local estimate. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, the exponential convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is established for a consistent system and its computational efficiency, robustness, and communication efficiency is validated through extensive numerical experiments. Furthermore, to address inconsistent systems, the algorithm introduces auxiliary variables to facilitate convergence toward an approximate least-squares solution, accompanied by a formal error analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains stability even under extreme asynchrony, communication failures, and node failures, while achieving significantly lower communication overhead and faster convergence rates compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>An efficient and accurate semi-implicit time integration scheme for dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of numerical integrator in approximating solutions to dynamic partial differential equations depends on the smallest time-scale of the problem at hand. Large-scale deformations in elastic solids contain both shear waves and bulk waves, the latter of which can travel infinitely fast in incompressible materials. Explicit schemes, which are favored for their efficiency in resolving low-speed dynamics, are bound by time step size restrictions that inversely scale with the fastest wave speed. Implicit schemes can enable larger time step sizes regardless of the wave speeds present, though they are much more computationally expensive. Semi-implicit methods, which are more stable than explicit methods and more efficient than implicit methods, are emerging in the literature, though their applicability to nonlinear elasticity is not extensively studied. In this research, we develop and investigate the functionality of two time integration schemes for the resolution of large-scale dynamics in nearly- and fully-incompressible hyperelastic solids: a Modified Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula integrator (MSBDF2) and a forward Euler / Semi-implicit Backward Differentiation Formula Runge-Kutta integrator (FEBDF2). We prove and empirically verify second order accuracy for both schemes. The stability properties of both methods are derived and numerically verified. We find FEBDF2 has a maximum time step size that inversely scales with the shear wave speed and is unaffected by the bulk wave speed -- the desired stability property of a semi-implicit scheme. Finally, we empirically determine that semi-implicit schemes struggle to preserve volume globally when using nonlinear incompressibility conditions, even under temporal and spatial refinement.</description>

      <title>Fully spectral scheme for the linear BGK equation on the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we design a fully spectral method in both space and velocity for a linear inhomogeneous kinetic equation with mass, momentum and energy conservation. We focus on the linear BGK equation with a confinement potential $\phi$, even if the method could be applied to different collision operators. It is based upon the projection on Hermite polynomials in velocity and orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight $e^{-\phi}$ in space. The potential $\phi$ is assumed to be a polynomial. It is, to the author's knowledge, the first scheme which preserves hypocoercive behavior in addition to the conservation laws. These different properties are illustrated numerically on both quadratic and double well potential.</description>

      <title>A multi-model study of the air pollution related to traffic flow in a two-dimensional porous metropolitan area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a useful reinterpretation of the city as a porous medium justifies the application of well-known models on fluid dynamics to develop a multi-model study of urban air pollution due to traffic flow in a large city. Thus, to simulate the traffic flow through the city we use a nonconservative macroscopic traffic model combining the continuity equation with the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer equations. For the air flow, regarding the emission rate of CO$_2$ and its dispersion in the atmosphere, we combine a microscopic model -- based on regression techniques but depending on vehicles' velocity and acceleration -- with a classical convection-diffusion-reaction transport model. To solve numerically above PDEs models, the finite element method of Lagrange $\rm{P_1}$ type along with suitable time marching schemes (like the strong stability preserving scheme) were sufficient to obtain stable numerical solutions. Several computational tests were run on a realistic scenario inspired by the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (Mexico), showing not only the influence of the urban landscape (that is, the porosity) on traffic flow, air flow, and pollution transport, but also other interesting phenomena such as rarefaction traffic waves.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of decoupled mixed FEM for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a decoupled, first-order, fully discrete, energy-stable scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. This scheme calculates the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes equations separately, thus effectively decoupling the entire system. To further separate the velocity and pressure components in the Navier-Stokes equations, we use the pressure-correction projection method. We demonstrate that the scheme is primitively energy stable and prove the optimal $L^2$ error estimate of the fully discrete scheme in the $P_r\times P_r\times P_r\times P_{r-1}$ finite element spaces, where the phase field, chemical potential, velocity and pressure satisfy the first-order accuracy in time and the $\left(r+1,r+1,r+1,r\right)th$-order accuracy in space, respectively. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted to support these theoretical findings. Notably, compared to other numerical schemes, our algorithm is more time-efficient and numerically shown to be unconditionally stable.</description>

      <title>Explicit adaptive time stepping for the Cahn-Hilliard equation by exponential Krylov subspace and Chebyshev polynomial methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation has been widely employed within various mathematical models in physics, chemistry and engineering. Explicit stabilized time stepping methods can be attractive for time integration of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, especially on parallel and hybrid supercomputers. In this paper, we propose an exponential time integration method for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and describe its efficient Krylov subspace based implementation. We compare the method to a Chebyshev polynomial local iteration modified (LIM) time stepping scheme. Both methods are explicit (i.e., do not involve linear system solution) and tested with both constant and adaptively chosen time steps.</description>

      <title>A hybrid minimizing movement and neural network approach to Willmore flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid method combining a minimizing movement scheme with neural operators for the simulation of phase field-based Willmore flow. The minimizing movement component is based on a standard optimization problem on a regular grid whereas the functional to be minimized involves a neural approximation of mean curvature flow proposed by Bretin et al. Numerical experiments confirm stability for large time step sizes, consistency and significantly reduced computational cost compared to a traditional finite element method. Moreover, applications demonstrate its effectiveness in surface fairing and reconstructing of damaged shapes. Thus, the approach offers a robust and efficient tool for geometry processing.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for Bayesian shape inversion governed by the Poisson problem subject to Gevrey regular domain deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo cubature rule to Bayesian shape inversion subject to the Poisson equation under Gevrey regular parameterizations of domain uncertainty. We analyze the parametric regularity of the associated posterior distribution and design randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules which can be shown to achieve dimension-independent, faster-than-Monte Carlo cubature convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals over the posterior distribution. In addition, we consider the effect of dimension truncation and finite element discretization errors for this model. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a posteriori error bounds for stabilized finite element discretizations of second-order steady-state mean field games. We prove the local equivalence between the $H^1$-norm of the error and the dual norm of the residual. We then derive reliable and efficient estimators for a broad class of stabilized first-order finite element methods. We also show that in the case of affine-preserving stabilizations, the estimator can be further simplified to the standard residual estimator. Numerical experiments illustrate the computational gains in efficiency and accuracy from the estimators in the context of adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>Meshless Shape Optimization using Neural Networks and Partial Differential Equations on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape optimization involves the minimization of a cost function defined over a set of shapes, often governed by a partial differential equation (PDE). In the absence of closed-form solutions, one relies on numerical methods to approximate the solution. The level set method -- when coupled with the finite element method -- is one of the most versatile numerical shape optimization approaches but still suffers from the limitations of most mesh-based methods. In this work, we present a fully meshless level set framework that leverages neural networks to parameterize the level set function and employs the graph Laplacian to approximate the underlying PDE. Our approach enables precise computations of geometric quantities such as surface normals and curvature, and allows tackling optimization problems within the class of convex shapes.</description>

      <title>GenEO spectral coarse spaces in SPD domain decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-level domain decomposition methods are preconditioned Krylov solvers. What separates one and two-level domain decomposition method is the presence of a coarse space in the latter. The abstract Schwarz framework is a formalism that allows to define and study a large variety of two-level methods. The objective of this article is to define, in the abstract Schwarz framework, a family of coarse spaces called the GenEO coarse spaces (for Generalized Eigenvalues in the Overlaps). This is a generalization of methods that exist already for particular choices of domain decomposition methods. Bounds for the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators are proved that are independent of the parameters in the problem (e.g., any coefficients in an underlying PDE or the number of subdomains). The coarse spaces are computed by finding low or high frequency spaces of some well chosen generalized eigenvalue problems in each subdomain. The abstract framework is illustrated by defining two-level Additive Schwarz, Neumann-Neumann and Inexact Schwarz preconditioners for a two dimensional linear elasticity problem. Explicit theoretical bounds as well as numerical results are provided for this example.</description>

      <title>A polytopal discrete de Rham complex on manifolds, with application to the Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design in this work a discrete de Rham complex on manifolds. This complex, written in the framework of exterior calculus, has the same cohomology as the continuous de Rham complex, is of arbitrary order of accuracy and, in principle, can be designed on meshes made of generic elements (that is, elements whose boundary is the union of an arbitrary number of curved edges/faces). Notions of local (full and trimmed) polynomial spaces are developed, with compatibility requirements between polynomials on mesh entities of various dimensions. We give explicit constructions of such polynomials in 2D, for some meshes made of curved triangles or quadrangles (such meshes are easy to design in many cases, starting from a few charts describing the manifold). The discrete de Rham complex is then used to set up a scheme for the Maxwell equations on a 2D manifold without boundary, and we show that a natural discrete version of the constraint linking the electric field and the electric charge density is satisfied. Numerical examples are provided on the sphere and the torus, based on bespoke analytical solutions and meshes on each of these manifolds.</description>

      <title>R3MG: R-tree based agglomeration of polytopal grids with applications to multilevel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18505v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to perform agglomeration of polygonal and polyhedral grids based on spatial indices. Agglomeration strategies are a key ingredient in polytopal methods for PDEs as they are used to generate (hierarchies of) computational grids from an initial grid. Spatial indices are specialized data structures that significantly accelerate queries involving spatial relationships in arbitrary space dimensions. We show how the construction of the R-tree spatial database of an arbitrary fine grid offers a natural and efficient agglomeration strategy with the following characteristics: i) the process is fully automated, robust, and dimension-independent, ii) it automatically produces a balanced and nested hierarchy of agglomerates, and iii) the shape of the agglomerates is tightly close to the respective axis aligned bounding boxes. Moreover, the R-tree approach provides a full hierarchy of nested agglomerates which permits fast query and allows for efficient geometric multigrid methods to be applied also to those cases where a hierarchy of grids is not present at construction time. We present several examples based on polygonal discontinuous Galerkin methods, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in the context of challenging three-dimensional geometries and the design of geometric multigrid preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for eigenvalues of singular polynomial eigenvalue problems</title>

Abstract: Recently, three numerical methods for the computation of eigenvalues of singular matrix pencils, based on a rank-completing perturbation, a rank-projection, or an augmentation were developed. We show that all three approaches can be generalized to treat singular polynomial eigenvalue problems. The common denominator of all three approaches is a transformation of a singular into a regular matrix polynomial whose eigenvalues are a disjoint union of the eigenvalues of the singular polynomial, called true eigenvalues, and additional fake eigenvalues. The true eigenvalues can then be separated from the fake eigenvalues using information on the corresponding left and right eigenvectors. We illustrate the approaches on several interesting applications, including bivariate polynomial systems and ZGV points.</description>

      <title>Commutator-free Cayley methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations posed on quadratic matrix Lie groups arise in the context of classical mechanics and quantum dynamical systems. Lie group numerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group. Thus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as unitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems, for instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group integrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie groups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and need to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve the Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of Cayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups while being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley-Magnus methods the method is also free from nested matrix commutators.</description>

      <title>Automatic optimal-rate convergence of randomized nets using median-of-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sample median of independently generated quasi-Monte Carlo estimators based on randomized digital nets and prove it approximates the target integral value at almost the optimal convergence rate for various function spaces. In contrast to previous methods, the algorithm does not require a priori knowledge of underlying function spaces or even an input of pre-designed $(t,m,s)$-digital nets, and is therefore easier to implement. This study provides further evidence that quasi-Monte Carlo estimators are heavy-tailed when applied to smooth integrands and taking the median can significantly improve the error by filtering out the outliers.</description>

      <title>The Carleman Contraction Mapping Method for a Coefficient Inverse Problem of the Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proposed to monitor spatial and temporal spreads of epidemics via solution of a Coefficient Inverse Problem for a system of three coupled nonlinear parabolic equations. To solve this problem numerically, a version of the so-called Carleman contraction mapping method is developed for this problem. On each iteration, a linear problem with the incomplete lateral Cauchy data is solved by the weighted Quasi-Reversibility Method, where the weight is the Carleman Weight Function. This is the function, which is involved as the weight in the Carleman estimate for the corresponding parabolic operator. Convergence analysis ensures the global convergence of this procedure. Numerical results demonstrate an accurate performance of this technique for noisy data.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations for a hyperbolic integrodifferential equation with a non-positive variable-sign kernel and nonlinear-nonlocal damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the Galerkin approximation and analysis for a hyperbolic integrodifferential equation, where the non-positive variable-sign kernel and nonlinear-nonlocal damping with both the weak and viscous damping effects are involved. We derive the long-time stability of the solution and its finite-time uniqueness. For the semi-discrete-in-space Galerkin scheme, we derive the long-time stability of the semi-discrete numerical solution and its finite-time error estimate by technical splitting of intricate terms. Then we further apply the centering difference method and the interpolating quadrature to construct a fully discrete Galerkin scheme and prove the long-time stability of the numerical solution and its finite-time error estimate by designing a new semi-norm. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Convexification With Viscosity Term for an Inverse Problem of Tikhonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965 A.N. Tikhonov, the founder of the theory of Ill-Posed and Inverse Problems, has posed an coefficient inverse problem of the recovery of the unknown electric conductivity coefficient from measurements of the back reflected electrical signal. In the geophysical application targeted by Tikhonov, this coefficient depends only on the depth and characterizes the electrical conductivity of the ground. The goal of this paper is to construct for this problem a version of the globally convergent convexification numerical method for this problem. In this version, the viscosity term is introduced. A Carleman estimate allows to prove global convergence of this method.</description>

      <title>Improved high-index saddle dynamics for finding saddle points and solution landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved high-index saddle dynamics (iHiSD) for finding saddle points and constructing solution landscapes, which is a crossover dynamics from gradient flow to traditional HiSD such that the Morse theory for gradient flow could be involved. We propose analysis for the reflection manifold in iHiSD, and then prove its stable and nonlocal convergence from outside of the region of attraction to the saddle point, which resolves the dependence of the convergence of HiSD on the initial value. We then present and analyze a discretized iHiSD that inherits these convergence properties. Furthermore, based on the Morse theory, we prove that any two saddle points could be connected by a sequence of trajectories of iHiSD. Theoretically, this implies that a solution landscape with a finite number of stationary points could be completely constructed by means of iHiSD, which partly answers the completeness issue of the solution landscape for the first time and indicates the necessity of integrating the gradient flow in HiSD. Different methods are compared by numerical experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of the iHiSD method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.</description>
