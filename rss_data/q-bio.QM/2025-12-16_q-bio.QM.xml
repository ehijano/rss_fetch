      <title>Vision Foundry: A System for Training Foundational Vision AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) leverages vast unannotated medical datasets, yet steep technical barriers limit adoption by clinical researchers. We introduce Vision Foundry, a code-free, HIPAA-compliant platform that democratizes pre-training, adaptation, and deployment of foundational vision models. The system integrates the DINO-MX framework, abstracting distributed infrastructure complexities while implementing specialized strategies like Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We validate the platform across domains, including neuropathology segmentation, lung cellularity estimation, and coronary calcium scoring. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained via Vision Foundry significantly outperform generic baselines in segmentation fidelity and regression accuracy, while exhibiting robust zero-shot generalization across imaging protocols. By bridging the gap between advanced representation learning and practical application, Vision Foundry enables domain experts to develop state-of-the-art clinical AI tools with minimal annotation overhead, shifting focus from engineering optimization to clinical discovery.</description>

      <title>GNN-Based Deep Surrogate Modeling of Knee Contact Mechanics: Generalizing Neuromuscular Control Patterns Across Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Accumulation of abnormal contact stress is a primary biomechanical driver of acute meniscal tears and chronic osteoarthritis. While Finite Element Analysis (FEA) provides the necessary fidelity to quantify these injury-inducing loads, its high computational cost precludes clinical utility. Emerging deep surrogate models promise real-time assessment but suffer a critical blind spot: they predominantly focus on learning anatomical variations, largely overlooking the neuromuscular control patterns. These dynamic, subject-specific motor strategies fundamentally dictate potentially injurious stress distributions inside the knee. Methods: This study investigates the generalization capability of the topology-aware MeshGraphNet regarding cross-subject neuromuscular control patterns under fixed anatomical conditions. We constructed a dataset using gait data from nine subjects via an OpenSim-FEBio co-simulation platform. The MGN was compared against a structure-agnostic Node-wise MLP using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects. Results: The MGN demonstrated superior fidelity, achieving a correlation of 0.94 with ground truth (vs. 0.88 for MLP). In contrast to the MLP, which exhibited the "peak shaving" defect common in deep learning, MGN significantly reduced peak-stress prediction errors and achieved higher spatial overlap in high-risk regions. This indicates that MGN effectively captured the non-local force-transmission pathways unique to each subject's movement strategy. Conclusion: By mimicking the propagation of physical stress through message passing, MGN successfully decodes the heterogeneity of human neuromuscular control, even under fixed anatomy. This establishes GNNs as robust clinical tools capable of identifying functional injury risks that are invisible to purely geometry-based surrogate models.</description>

      <title>DCAF-Net: Dual-Channel Attentive Fusion Network for Lower Limb Motion Intention Prediction in Stroke Rehabilitation Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rehabilitation exoskeletons have shown promising results in promoting recovery for stroke patients. Accurately and timely identifying the motion intentions of patients is a critical challenge in enhancing active participation during lower limb exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation training. This paper proposes a Dual-Channel Attentive Fusion Network (DCAF-Net) that synergistically integrates pre-movement surface electromyography (sEMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data for lower limb intention prediction in stroke patients. First, a dual-channel adaptive channel attention module is designed to extract discriminative features from 48 time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from bilateral gastrocnemius sEMG signals. Second, an IMU encoder combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention-based long short-term memory (attention-LSTM) layers is designed to decode temporal-spatial movement patterns. Third, the sEMG and IMU features are fused through concatenation to enable accurate recognition of motion intention. Extensive experiment on 11 participants (8 stroke subjects and 3 healthy subjects) demonstrate the effectiveness of DCAF-Net. It achieved a prediction accuracies of 97.19% for patients and 93.56% for healthy subjects. This study provides a viable solution for implementing intention-driven human-in-the-loop assistance control in clinical rehabilitation robotics.</description>

      <title>Scalable branch-and-bound model selection with non-monotonic criteria including AIC, BIC and Mallows's $\mathit{C_p}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model selection is a pivotal process in the quantitative sciences, where researchers must navigate between numerous candidate models of varying complexity. Traditional information criteria, such as the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Mallows's $\mathit{C_p}$, are valuable tools for identifying optimal models. However, the exponential increase in candidate models with each additional model parameter renders the evaluation of these criteria for all models -- a strategy known as exhaustive, or brute-force, searches -- computationally prohibitive. Consequently, heuristic approaches like stepwise regression are commonly employed, albeit without guarantees of finding the globally-optimal model.
  In this study, we challenge the prevailing notion that non-monotonicity in information criteria precludes bounds on the search space. We introduce a simple but novel bound that enables the development of branch-and-bound algorithms tailored for these non-monotonic functions. We demonstrate that our approach guarantees identification of the optimal model(s) across diverse model classes, sizes, and applications, often with orders of magnitude computational speedups. For instance, in one previously-published model selection task involving $2^{32}$ (approximately 4 billion) candidate models, our method achieves a computational speedup exceeding 6,000. These findings have broad implications for the scalability and effectiveness of model selection in complex scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Accurate de novo sequencing of the modified proteome with OmniNovo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) serve as a dynamic chemical language regulating protein function, yet current proteomic methods remain blind to a vast portion of the modified proteome. Standard database search algorithms suffer from a combinatorial explosion of search spaces, limiting the identification of uncharacterized or complex modifications. Here we introduce OmniNovo, a unified deep learning framework for reference-free sequencing of unmodified and modified peptides directly from tandem mass spectra. Unlike existing tools restricted to specific modification types, OmniNovo learns universal fragmentation rules to decipher diverse PTMs within a single coherent model. By integrating a mass-constrained decoding algorithm with rigorous false discovery rate estimation, OmniNovo achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, identifying 51\% more peptides than standard approaches at a 1\% false discovery rate. Crucially, the model generalizes to biological sites unseen during training, illuminating the dark matter of the proteome and enabling unbiased comprehensive analysis of cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>Investigating High-Order Behaviors in Multivariate Cardiovascular Interactions via Nonlinear Prediction and Information-Theoretic Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the synergistic high-order behaviors (HOBs) that emerge from underlying structural mechanisms is crucial to characterize complex systems. This work leverages the combined use of predictability and information measures to detect and quantify HOBs in synthetic and physiological network systems. After providing formal definitions of mechanisms and behaviors in a complex system, measures of statistical synergy are defined as the whole-minus-sum excess of mutual predictability ($\Delta_\textrm{MP}$) or mutual information ($\Delta_\textrm{MI}$) obtained when considering the system as a whole rather than as a combination of its units. The two measures are computed using model-free methods based on nonlinear prediction and entropy estimation. The application to simulated linear Gaussian systems and nonlinear deterministic and stochastic dynamic systems shows that $\Delta_\textrm{MP}$ tends to vanish for target variables influenced by additive effects of single independent source variables and is positive in the presence of group interactions between sources, while $\Delta_\textrm{MI}$ exhibits a higher propensity to display positive values. The analysis of physiological variables shows significant values of $\Delta_\textrm{MI}$ when investigating the additive effect of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure on mean arterial pressure, and of both $\Delta_\textrm{MP}$ and $\Delta_\textrm{MI}$ when assessing how diastolic pressure is modulated by pre-ejection and left-ventricular ejection times. HOBs can be more clearly identified by information-theoretic measures, while prediction measures are more sensitive to synergy arising from the governing rules of the system analyzed rather than from pure statistical dependencies. Quantifying HOBs through measures sensitive to structural mechanisms can provide biomarkers to assess physio-pathological alterations of cardiovascular networks.</description>

      <title>Cycles Communities from the Perspective of Dendrograms and Gradient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and comparing topological features, particularly cycles, across different topological objects remains a fundamental challenge in persistent homology and topological data analysis. This work introduces a novel framework for constructing cycle communities through two complementary approaches. First, a dendrogram-based methodology leverages merge-tree algorithms to construct hierarchical representations of homology classes from persistence intervals. The Wasserstein distance on merge trees is introduced as a metric for comparing dendrograms, establishing connections to hierarchical clustering frameworks. Through simulation studies, the discriminative power of dendrogram representations for identifying cycle communities is demonstrated. Second, an extension of Stratified Gradient Sampling simultaneously learns multiple filter functions that yield cycle barycenter functions capable of faithfully reconstructing distinct sets of cycles. The set of cycles each filter function can reconstruct constitutes cycle communities that are non-overlapping and partition the space of all cycles. Together, these approaches transform the problem of cycle matching into both a hierarchical clustering and topological optimization framework, providing principled methods to identify similar topological structures both within and across groups of topological objects.</description>

      <title>Nondimensionalization is more science than art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When faced with a mathematical model, often the first step is to reduce the complexity of the model by turning variables and parameters into dimensionless quantities. This process is often performed by hand, relying on a skill practiced over many years, and attempted for small models. Nondimensionalization is often considered an art, as there is no formal method accessible to applied scientists. Here we show how to systematically perform nondimensionalization for arbitrarily sized models described by rational first order ordinary differential equations. We translate and extend an existing approach for computing rational invariants of the maximal scaling symmetry, which combines ideas from differential algebra, invariant theory and linear algebra, to the setting arising in biological models. The modeler inputs the system of equations and our implemented algorithm outputs the nondimensional quantities for the corresponding nondimensionalized model. We extend the algorithm to include initial conditions, and the modeler's choice of invariants, thereby including a larger class of nondimensionalizations. We further prove that any dimensionally consistent change of variables preserves the dimension of the maximal scaling symmetry. We showcase the framework on various models, including the classical Michaelis-Menten equations, which serves as a benchmark for asking and answering specific modeling questions.</description>

      <title>MolGuidance: Advanced Guidance Strategies for Conditional Molecular Generation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key objectives in conditional molecular generation include ensuring chemical validity, aligning generated molecules with target properties, promoting structural diversity, and enabling efficient sampling for discovery. Recent advances in computer vision introduced a range of new guidance strategies for generative models, many of which can be adapted to support these goals. In this work, we integrate state-of-the-art guidance methods -- including classifier-free guidance, autoguidance, and model guidance -- in a leading molecule generation framework built on an SE(3)-equivariant flow matching process. We propose a hybrid guidance strategy that separately guides continuous and discrete molecular modalities -- operating on velocity fields and predicted logits, respectively -- while jointly optimizing their guidance scales via Bayesian optimization. Our implementation, benchmarked on the QM9 and QMe14S datasets, achieves new state-of-the-art performance in property alignment for de novo molecular generation. The generated molecules also exhibit high structural validity. Furthermore, we systematically compare the strengths and limitations of various guidance methods, offering insights into their broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Automated Histopathologic Assessment of Hirschsprung Disease Using a Multi-Stage Vision Transformer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, the correct identification of ganglion cells is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage analysis framework that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework, based on a Vision Transformer model (ViT-B/16), sequentially segments the muscularis propria, segments the myenteric plexus, and detects ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For ganglion cells annotated with high certainty, the model achieved 62.1\% precision and 89.1% recall. When considering all annotated ganglion cells, regardless of certainty level, the overall precision was 67.0%. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.</description>

      <title>PathRWKV: Enabling Whole Slide Prediction with Recurrent-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is essential for cancer diagnosis, with whole slide image (WSI) providing histopathological and cellular information. Recent deep learning advancements have improved WSI analysis through a two-stage paradigm: tile-level feature extraction followed by slide-level modeling. In this paradigm, Transformer-based models surpass traditional multiple instance learning approaches in accuracy, yet still face four core limitations: (1) inadequate handling of variable tissue sizes across slides, (2) inability to effectively infer from all tiles for slide-level conclusions, (3) challenges in balancing model complexity with limited training data, and (4) difficulty balancing training efficiency and inference performance. Consequently, these issues limit whole-slide perception for diagnosis with restricted WSI training scales. To address them, we introduce PathRWKV, a novel state space model for slide-level feature modeling. To handle variable tissue sizes, PathRWKV employs two modules: Time Mix and Channel Mix, enabling dynamic perception of tiles for improved slide-level modeling. To draw effective conclusions, we propose an asymmetric design that samples tiles during training and iterates over all tiles at inference, scaling up to cover the entire slide. To balance model complexity and data size, we adopt linear attention and state space architecture with a Recurrent module. To balance training efficiency and inference, we design a tailored multi-task learning module handling versatile tasks simultaneously, enhancing model ability via multiple clinical indicators in slide reading. Experimental results show PathRWKV outperforms nine recent state-of-the-art methods across 10 downstream tasks on 11 datasets with 17,292 WSIs, paving its way for efficient slide-level pathological inference. The project is open-sourced.</description>
