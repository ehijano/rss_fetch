      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheetham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient large scale computer simulations of complex aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the growing complexity of these systems is evidencing the difficulties to describe solution properties without due account of polarization. Conflicting strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of the solvated ions.
  In this work we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized with an emphasis in the prediction of the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The overall performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P$/\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally good, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, as well as surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe solution densities for model ions targeted to their crystal and melt properties. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and cast some doubt on the need for the appealing concept of charge scaling.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spherulitic Crystal Growth from Salt Mixtures: A Universal Mechanism for Complex Crystal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherulites are complex polycrystalline structures that form through the self-assembly of small aggregated nanocrystals starting from a central point and growing radially outward. Despite their wide prevalence and relevance to fields ranging from geology to medicine, the dynamics of spherulitic crystallization and the conditions required for such growth remain ill-understood. Here, we report on the conditions to induce controlled spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate from evaporating aqueous solutions of sulfate salt mixtures at room temperature. We reveal that introducing divalent metal ions in the solution cause spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate. For the first time, we quantify the supersaturation at the onset of spherulitic growth from salt mixtures and determine the growth kinetics. Our results show that the nonclassical nucleation process induces the growth of sodium sulfate spherulites at high supersaturation in highly viscous solutions. The latter reaches approximately 111 Pa$\cdot$s, triggered by the divalent ions, at the onset of spherulite precipitation leading to a diffusion limited growth. We also show that spherulites, which are metastable structures formed under out-of-equilibrium conditions, can evolve into other shapes when supersaturation decreases as growth continues at different evaporation rates. These findings shed light on the conditions under which spherulites form and offer practical strategies for tuning their morphology.</description>

      <title>A continuum mechanics approach for the deformation of non-Euclidean origami generated by piecewise constant nematic director fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We merge classical origami concepts with active actuation by designing origami patterns whose panels undergo prescribed metric changes. These metric changes render the system non-Euclidean, inducing non-zero Gaussian curvature at the vertices after actuation. Such patterns can be realized by programming piecewise constant director fields in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) sheets. In this work, we address the geometric design of both compatible reference director patterns and their corresponding actuated configurations. On the reference configuration, we systematically construct director patterns that satisfy metric compatibility across interfaces. On the actuated configuration, we develop a continuum mechanics framework to analyze the kinematics of non-Euclidean origami. In particular, we fully characterize the deformation spaces of three-fold and four-fold vertices and establish analytical relationships between their deformations and the director patterns. Building on these kinematic insights, we propose two rational designs of large director patterns: one based on a quadrilateral tiling with alternating positive and negative actuated Gaussian curvature, and another combining three-fold and four-fold vertices governed by a folding angle theorem. Remarkably, both designs achieve compatibility in both the reference and actuated states. We anticipate that our geometric framework will facilitate the design of non-Euclidean/active origami structures and broaden their application in active metamaterials, soft actuators, and robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Colloidal nanoparticles in cholesteric liquid crystals: Bulk properties, biaxiality and untwisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in cholesteric liquid crystal samples in the dilute limit, in a Landau-de Gennes theoretical framework. The effects of the suspended NPs are captured by a homogenized energy, as outlined in [7]. For spatially homogeneous samples, we explicitly compute the critical points and minimizers of the modified Landau-de Gennes energy and show that the presence of NP eliminates the first-order isotropic-nematic phase transition, stabilises elusive biaxial phases over some temperature ranges, and that the symmetry of the NP boundary conditions or surface treatments dictates the bulk equilibrium phase at high temperatures. We also numerically demonstrate structural transitions from twisted helical director profiles to untwisted director profiles, in cholesteric-filled channel geometries, driven by the collective effects of the NPs and increasing temperature. These transitions are reversible upon lowering the temperature in sufficiently large domains, where thermal hysteresis can also be observed. This behaviour opens interesting avenues for tuning the optical properties of confined, nano-doped cholesteric systems.</description>

      <title>Micelle Forming Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: A Theoretical Comparison between Random Hyperbranched and Precise Dendrimer Polymer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbranched block copolymers offer a simpler and more efficient synthesis route compared to more traditional dendritic systems, while still providing exceptional control over surface functionality and self-assembly. This makes them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties for applications such as drug delivery and sensing. Here we use self-consistent field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-Driven Instabilities Govern Size, Shape and Migration Efficiency of Multicellular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective chemotaxis of multicellular clusters is an important phenomenon in various physiological contexts, ranging from embryonic development to cancer metastasis. Such clusters often display interesting shape dynamics and instabilities, but their physical origin, functional benefits, and role in overall chemotactic migration remain unclear. Here, we combine computational modeling and experimental observations of malignant lymphocyte cluster migration in vitro to understand how these dynamics arise from an interplay of chemotactic response and inter-cellular interactions. Our cell-based computational model incorporates active propulsion of cells, contact inhibition of locomotion, chemoattractant response, as well as alignment, adhesive, and exclusion interactions between cells. We find that clusters remain fluid and maintain cohesive forward migration in low chemoattractant gradients. However, above a threshold gradient, clusters display an instability driven by local cluster-shape dependent velocity differentials that causes them to elongate perpendicular to the gradient and eventually break apart. Comparison with our in vitro data shows the predicted transition to the cluster instability regime with increased gradient, as well as quantitative agreement with key features such as cluster aspect ratio, orientation, and breaking frequency. This instability naturally limits the size of multicellular aggregates, and, in addition, clusters in the instability regime display optimal forward migration speeds, suggesting functional implications in vivo. Our work provides valuable insights into generic instabilities of chemotactic clusters, elucidates physical factors that could contribute to metastatic spreading, and can be extended to other living or synthetic systems of active clusters.</description>

      <title>Energies for elastic plates and shells from quadratic-stretch elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stretching and bending energies for isotropic elastic plates and shells. Through the dimensional reduction of a bulk elastic energy quadratic in Biot strains, we obtain two-dimensional bending energies quadratic in bending measures featuring a bilinear coupling of stretches and geometric curvatures. For plates, the bending measure is invariant under spatial dilations and naturally extends primitive bending strains for straight rods. For shells or naturally-curved rods, the measure is not dilation invariant, and contrasts with previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The corresponding field equations and boundary conditions feature moments linear in the bending measures, and a decoupling of stretching and bending such that application of a pure moment results in isometric deformation of a unique neutral surface, primitive behaviors in agreement with classical linear response but not displayed by commonly used analytical models. We briefly comment on relations between our energies, those derived from a neo-Hookean bulk energy, and a commonly used discrete model for flat membranes. Although the derivation requires consideration of stretch and rotation fields, the resulting energy and field equations can be expressed entirely in terms of metric and curvature components of deformed and reference surfaces.</description>

      <title>There is Nothing Anomalous about 'Anomalous' Underscreening in Concentrated Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while moderate screening lengths - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of many electrostatic screening modes present at any one time. We present a new approach for extracting screening lengths directly from the bulk charge density that reveals the origins of both normal and anomalous underscreening. These results reconcile a decades-old disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Hump in the Cubic Dielectric Response of Glycerol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a direct determination of the cubic dielectric spectra of a realistic polar molecule, glycerol, from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. From the liquid state to the mildly supercooled regime, we observed the emergence and growth of a hump in the cubic modulus, traditionally associated with collective effects in the dynamics. Its evolution follows that of dynamical correlations probed by the four-point susceptibility and that of the activation energy of the relaxation time. In particular, its appearance at high temperature coincides with the onset of super-activation. We show that, for this system, the shape of cubic spectra is only weakly affected by dipolar cross-correlations. The good agreement with experimental observations, despite the difference in temperature range, demonstrates the relevance of this approach to help get an insight into the intricate effects probed by non-linear dielectric spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Shear stresses in fluid and solid membranes with bending elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparison of a few simple models of fluid and solid membranes illustrates how shear stresses can arise from a bending energy through a coupling between curvature and surface stresses, a feature incidental to the fluid or solid nature of the material. In particular, it is shown how a fluid-like Helfrich bending energy contributes shear stresses, while a related solid-like energy, the correct continuum limit of a Seung-Nelson discrete bending term, produces a stress tensor with purely isotropic tangential part. A distinction is noted between the resistance to tangential flows on the surface and the ability to support tangential stresses. The tangential projection of the divergence of the stress, or the pseudomomentum balance, is viewed in the light of some statements and observations in the literature. Different types of constraints, invariance properties, and shape equations are briefly discussed. The state of a patch of unidirectionally-bent material is connected with prior analyses of the pulling of membrane tethers.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Intermediate Range Order in Jammed Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a structural analysis of large scale jammed packings of monodisperse, frictionless and frictional spheres to elucidate structural signatures of the static structure factor in the low-to-intermediate wavenumber ($q$) region. We employ discrete element method simulations containing up to eighty million particles, in which the particle friction coefficient(s), including sliding, rolling, and twisting interactions, are varied. At intermediate $q$ values, corresponding to length scales that lie between that of the nearest neighbor primary peak and the system size, we find the emergence of a prepeak -- a signature of intermediate range order -- that grows with increasing friction. We correlate the emergence of this peak to real space fluctuations in the local particle coordination number, which exhibits a grainy fluctuating field throughout the packing process that is retained in the final, mechanically stable state. While the formation of the prepeak shows varying degrees of robustness to packing protocol changes, our results suggest that preparation history may be used to construct packings with variable large length scale structural properties.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <title>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09670v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated. In this study, from a functional perspective, we computationally investigate the impact of Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations through parameter variation. Our simulation results reveal that delayed Pi-release can significantly enhance energy efficiency during muscle contraction. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle contraction.</description>

      <title>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</description>

Abstract: The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</description>
