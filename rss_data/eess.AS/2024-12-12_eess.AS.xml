      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Discriminative and Generative E2E Speech Enhancement Models on Syllable Stress Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic syllable stress detection is a crucial component in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems for language learners. Current stress detection models are typically trained on clean speech, which may not be robust in real-world scenarios where background noise is prevalent. To address this, speech enhancement (SE) models, designed to enhance speech by removing noise, might be employed, but their impact on preserving syllable stress patterns is not well studied. This study examines how different SE models, representing discriminative and generative modeling approaches, affect syllable stress detection under noisy conditions. We assess these models by applying them to speech data with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 20 dB, and evaluating their effectiveness in maintaining stress patterns. Additionally, we explore different feature sets to determine which ones are most effective for capturing stress patterns amidst noise. To further understand the impact of SE models, a human-based perceptual study is conducted to compare the perceived stress patterns in SE-enhanced speech with those in clean speech, providing insights into how well these models preserve syllable stress as perceived by listeners. Experiments are performed on English speech data from non-native speakers of German and Italian. And the results reveal that the stress detection performance is robust with the generative SE models when heuristic features are used. Also, the observations from the perceptual study are consistent with the stress detection outcomes under all SE models.</description>

      <title>Frechet Music Distance: A Metric For Generative Symbolic Music Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Frechet Music Distance (FMD), a novel evaluation metric for generative symbolic music models, inspired by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) in computer vision and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) in generative audio. FMD calculates the distance between distributions of reference and generated symbolic music embeddings, capturing abstract musical features. We validate FMD across several datasets and models. Results indicate that FMD effectively differentiates model quality, providing a domain-specific metric for evaluating symbolic music generation, and establishing a reproducible standard for future research in symbolic music modeling.</description>

      <title>Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm: Advancing Text-to-Speech Models with Aligner Guided Duration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as FastSpeech and StyleSpeech, have significantly improved speech generation quality. However, these models often rely on duration generated by external tools like the Montreal Forced Aligner, which can be time-consuming and lack flexibility. The importance of accurate duration is often underestimated, despite their crucial role in achieving natural prosody and intelligibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm that prioritizes accurate duration labelling by training an aligner before the TTS model. This approach reduces dependence on external tools and enhances alignment accuracy. We further explore the impact of different acoustic features, including Mel-Spectrograms, MFCCs, and latent features, on TTS model performance. Our experimental results show that aligner-guided duration labelling can achieve up to a 16\% improvement in word error rate and significantly enhance phoneme and tone alignment. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing TTS systems for more natural and intelligible speech generation.</description>

      <title>LatentSpeech: Latent Diffusion for Text-To-Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based Generative AI gains significant attention for its superior performance over other generative techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders. While it has achieved notable advancements in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, their application in speech generation remains under-explored. Mainstream Text-to-Speech systems primarily map outputs to Mel-Spectrograms in the spectral space, leading to high computational loads due to the sparsity of MelSpecs. To address these limitations, we propose LatentSpeech, a novel TTS generation approach utilizing latent diffusion models. By using latent embeddings as the intermediate representation, LatentSpeech reduces the target dimension to 5% of what is required for MelSpecs, simplifying the processing for the TTS encoder and vocoder and enabling efficient high-quality speech generation. This study marks the first integration of latent diffusion models in TTS, enhancing the accuracy and naturalness of generated speech. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LatentSpeech achieves a 25% improvement in Word Error Rate and a 24% improvement in Mel Cepstral Distortion compared to existing models, with further improvements rising to 49.5% and 26%, respectively, with additional training data. These findings highlight the potential of LatentSpeech to advance the state-of-the-art in TTS technology</description>

      <title>Collaborative Hybrid Propagator for Temporal Misalignment in Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual video segmentation (AVVS) aims to generate pixel-level maps of sound-producing objects that accurately align with the corresponding audio. However, existing methods often face temporal misalignment, where audio cues and segmentation results are not temporally coordinated. Audio provides two critical pieces of information: i) target object-level details and ii) the timing of when objects start and stop producing sounds. Current methods focus more on object-level information but neglect the boundaries of audio semantic changes, leading to temporal misalignment. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Hybrid Propagator Framework~(Co-Prop). This framework includes two main steps: Preliminary Audio Boundary Anchoring and Frame-by-Frame Audio-Insert Propagation. To Anchor the audio boundary, we employ retrieval-assist prompts with Qwen large language models to identify control points of audio semantic changes. These control points split the audio into semantically consistent audio portions. After obtaining the control point lists, we propose the Audio Insertion Propagator to process each audio portion using a frame-by-frame audio insertion propagation and matching approach. We curated a compact dataset comprising diverse source conversion cases and devised a metric to assess alignment rates. Compared to traditional simultaneous processing methods, our approach reduces memory requirements and facilitates frame alignment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three datasets and two backbones. Furthermore, our method can be integrated with existing AVVS approaches, offering plug-and-play functionality to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>TouchTTS: An Embarrassingly Simple TTS Framework that Everyone Can Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08237v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.</description>

      <title>MoMuSE: Momentum Multi-modal Target Speaker Extraction for Real-time Scenarios with Impaired Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture using time-synchronized visual cues. In real-world scenarios, visual cues are not always available due to various impairments, which undermines the stability of AV-TSE. Despite this challenge, humans can maintain attentional momentum over time, even when the target speaker is not visible. In this paper, we introduce the Momentum Multi-modal target Speaker Extraction (MoMuSE), which retains a speaker identity momentum in memory, enabling the model to continuously track the target speaker. Designed for real-time inference, MoMuSE extracts the current speech window with guidance from both visual cues and dynamically updated speaker momentum. Experimental results demonstrate that MoMuSE exhibits significant improvement, particularly in scenarios with severe impairment of visual cues.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Analysis of Automatic Word and Syllable Prominence Detection in Non-Native Speech With Text-to-Speech Prosody Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection of prominence at the word and syllable-levels is critical for building computer-assisted language learning systems. It has been shown that prosody embeddings learned by the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-speech (TTS) systems could generate word- and syllable-level prominence in the synthesized speech as natural as in native speech. To understand the effectiveness of prosody embeddings from TTS for prominence detection under nonnative context, a comparative analysis is conducted on the embeddings extracted from native and non-native speech considering the prominence-related embeddings: duration, energy, and pitch from a SOTA TTS named FastSpeech2. These embeddings are extracted under two conditions considering: 1) only text, 2) both speech and text. For the first condition, the embeddings are extracted directly from the TTS inference mode, whereas for the second condition, we propose to extract from the TTS under training mode. Experiments are conducted on native speech corpus: Tatoeba, and non-native speech corpus: ISLE. For experimentation, word-level prominence locations are manually annotated for both corpora. The highest relative improvement on word \&amp; syllable-level prominence detection accuracies with the TTS embeddings are found to be 13.7% &amp; 5.9% and 16.2% &amp; 6.9% compared to those with the heuristic-based features and self-supervised Wav2Vec-2.0 representations, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model For Voice and Accent Conversion In Speech and Singing using Self-Supervised Learning and Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new voice conversion model capable of transforming both speaking and singing voices. It addresses key challenges in current systems, such as conveying emotions, managing pronunciation and accent changes, and reproducing non-verbal sounds. One of the model's standout features is its ability to perform accent conversion on hybrid voice samples that encompass both speech and singing, allowing it to change the speaker's accent while preserving the original content and prosody. The proposed model uses an encoder-decoder architecture: the encoder is based on HuBERT to process the speech's acoustic and linguistic content, while the HiFi-GAN decoder audio matches the target speaker's voice. The model incorporates fundamental frequency (f0) features and singer embeddings to enhance performance while ensuring the pitch &amp; tone accuracy and vocal identity are preserved during transformation. This approach improves how naturally and flexibly voice style can be transformed, showing strong potential for applications in voice dubbing, content creation, and technologies like Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems.</description>

      <title>SyncViolinist: Music-Oriented Violin Motion Generation Based on Bowing and Fingering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically generating realistic musical performance motion can greatly enhance digital media production, often involving collaboration between professionals and musicians. However, capturing the intricate body, hand, and finger movements required for accurate musical performances is challenging. Existing methods often fall short due to the complex mapping between audio and motion, typically requiring additional inputs like scores or MIDI data. In this work, we present SyncViolinist, a multi-stage end-to-end framework that generates synchronized violin performance motion solely from audio input. Our method overcomes the challenge of capturing both global and fine-grained performance features through two key modules: a bowing/fingering module and a motion generation module. The bowing/fingering module extracts detailed playing information from the audio, which the motion generation module uses to create precise, coordinated body motions reflecting the temporal granularity and nature of the violin performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SyncViolinist with significantly improved qualitative and quantitative results from unseen violin performance audio, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Extensive subjective evaluations involving professional violinists further validate our approach. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Kakanat/SyncViolinist.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Mono-to-Binaural Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ZeroBAS, a neural method to synthesize binaural audio from monaural audio recordings and positional information without training on any binaural data. To our knowledge, this is the first published zero-shot neural approach to mono-to-binaural audio synthesis. Specifically, we show that a parameter-free geometric time warping and amplitude scaling based on source location suffices to get an initial binaural synthesis that can be refined by iteratively applying a pretrained denoising vocoder. Furthermore, we find this leads to generalization across room conditions, which we measure by introducing a new dataset, TUT Mono-to-Binaural, to evaluate state-of-the-art monaural-to-binaural synthesis methods on unseen conditions. Our zero-shot method is perceptually on-par with the performance of supervised methods on the standard mono-to-binaural dataset, and even surpasses them on our out-of-distribution TUT Mono-to-Binaural dataset. Our results highlight the potential of pretrained generative audio models and zero-shot learning to unlock robust binaural audio synthesis.</description>

      <title>PointTalk: Audio-Driven Dynamic Lip Point Cloud for 3D Gaussian-based Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial challenge in the field of digital humans. Recently, methods based on radiance fields have received increasing attention due to their ability to synthesize high-fidelity and identity-consistent talking heads from just a few minutes of training video. However, due to the limited scale of the training data, these methods often exhibit poor performance in audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian-based method called PointTalk, which constructs a static 3D Gaussian field of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. It also incorporates an audio-driven dynamic lip point cloud as a critical component of the conditional information, thereby facilitating the effective synthesis of talking heads. Specifically, the initial step involves generating the corresponding lip point cloud from the audio signal and capturing its topological structure. The design of the dynamic difference encoder aims to capture the subtle nuances inherent in dynamic lip movements more effectively. Furthermore, we integrate the audio-point enhancement module, which not only ensures the synchronization of the audio signal with the corresponding lip point cloud within the feature space, but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the interrelations among cross-modal conditional features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking head synthesis compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Training Data of Music Generation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08549v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) models are increasingly used to produce content across domains, including text, images, and audio. While these models represent a major technical breakthrough, they gain their generative capabilities from being trained on enormous amounts of human-generated content, which often includes copyrighted material. In this work, we investigate whether audio watermarking techniques can be used to detect an unauthorized usage of content to train a music generation model. We compare outputs generated by a model trained on watermarked data to a model trained on non-watermarked data. We study factors that impact the model's generation behaviour: the watermarking technique, the proportion of watermarked samples in the training set, and the robustness of the watermarking technique against the model's tokenizer. Our results show that audio watermarking techniques, including some that are imperceptible to humans, can lead to noticeable shifts in the model's outputs. We also study the robustness of a state-of-the-art watermarking technique to removal techniques.</description>

      <title>Sketch2Sound: Controllable Audio Generation via Time-Varying Signals and Sonic Imitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Sketch2Sound, a generative audio model capable of creating high-quality sounds from a set of interpretable time-varying control signals: loudness, brightness, and pitch, as well as text prompts. Sketch2Sound can synthesize arbitrary sounds from sonic imitations (i.e.,~a vocal imitation or a reference sound-shape). Sketch2Sound can be implemented on top of any text-to-audio latent diffusion transformer (DiT), and requires only 40k steps of fine-tuning and a single linear layer per control, making it more lightweight than existing methods like ControlNet. To synthesize from sketchlike sonic imitations, we propose applying random median filters to the control signals during training, allowing Sketch2Sound to be prompted using controls with flexible levels of temporal specificity. We show that Sketch2Sound can synthesize sounds that follow the gist of input controls from a vocal imitation while retaining the adherence to an input text prompt and audio quality compared to a text-only baseline. Sketch2Sound allows sound artists to create sounds with the semantic flexibility of text prompts and the expressivity and precision of a sonic gesture or vocal imitation. Sound examples are available at https://hugofloresgarcia.art/sketch2sound/.</description>

      <title>Mel-Refine: A Plug-and-Play Approach to Refine Mel-Spectrogram in Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) model is capable of generating diverse audio from textual prompts. However, most mainstream TTA models, which predominantly rely on Mel-spectrograms, still face challenges in producing audio with rich content. The intricate details and texture required in Mel-spectrograms for such audio often surpass the models' capacity, leading to outputs that are blurred or lack coherence. In this paper, we begin by investigating the critical role of U-Net in Mel-spectrogram generation. Our analysis shows that in U-Net structure, high-frequency components in skip-connections and the backbone influence texture and detail, while low-frequency components in the backbone are critical for the diffusion denoising process. We further propose ``Mel-Refine'', a plug-and-play approach that enhances Mel-spectrogram texture and detail by adjusting different component weights during inference. Our method requires no additional training or fine-tuning and is fully compatible with any diffusion-based TTA architecture. Experimental results show that our approach boosts performance metrics of the latest TTA model Tango2 by 25\%, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>AdvWave: Stealthy Adversarial Jailbreak Attack against Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have enabled speech-based user interactions, significantly enhancing user experience and accelerating the deployment of LALMs in real-world applications. However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate AI regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40% higher average jailbreak attack success rate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prominence of the field of audio deepfake detection is driven by its wide range of applications, notably in protecting the public from potential fraud and other malicious activities, prompting the need for greater attention and research in this area. The ADD 2023 challenge goes beyond binary real/fake classification by emulating real-world scenarios, such as the identification of manipulated intervals in partially fake audio and determining the source responsible for generating any fake audio, both with real-life implications, notably in audio forensics, law enforcement, and construction of reliable and trustworthy evidence. To further foster research in this area, in this article, we describe the dataset that was used in the fake game, manipulation region location and deepfake algorithm recognition tracks of the challenge. We also focus on the analysis of the technical methodologies by the top-performing participants in each task and note the commonalities and differences in their approaches. Finally, we discuss the current technical limitations as identified through the technical analysis, and provide a roadmap for future research directions. The dataset is available for download at http://addchallenge.cn/downloadADD2023.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Speaker Representation for Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) relies on a reference cue of the target to extract the target speech from a speech mixture. While a speaker embedding is commonly used as the reference cue, such embedding pre-trained with a large number of speakers may suffer from confusion of speaker identity. In this work, we propose a multi-level speaker representation approach, from raw features to neural embeddings, to serve as the speaker reference cue. We generate a spectral-level representation from the enrollment magnitude spectrogram as a raw, low-level feature, which significantly improves the model's generalization capability. Additionally, we propose a contextual embedding feature based on cross-attention mechanisms that integrate frame-level embeddings from a pre-trained speaker encoder. By incorporating speaker features across multiple levels, we significantly enhance the performance of the TSE model. Our approach achieves a 2.74 dB improvement and a 4.94% increase in extraction accuracy on Libri2mix test set over the baseline.</description>

      <title>Which Augmentation Should I Use? An Empirical Investigation of Augmentations for Self-Supervised Phonocardiogram Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in deep learning, its application in real-world medical settings, such as phonocardiogram (PCG) classification, remains limited. A significant barrier is the lack of high-quality annotated datasets, which hampers the development of robust, generalizable models that can perform well on newly collected, out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) contrastive learning, has shown promise in mitigating the issue of data scarcity by using unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. Even though SSL methods have been proposed and researched in other domains, works focusing on the impact of data augmentations on model robustness for PCG classification are limited. In particular, while augmentations are a key component in SSL, selecting the most suitable policy during training is highly challenging. Improper augmentations can lead to substantial performance degradation and even hinder a network's ability to learn meaningful representations. Addressing this gap, our research aims to explore and evaluate a wide range of audio-based augmentations and uncover combinations that enhance SSL model performance in PCG classification. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis across multiple datasets, assessing the impact of various augmentations on model performance. Our findings reveal that depending on the training distribution, augmentation choice significantly influences model robustness, with fully-supervised models experiencing up to a 32\% drop in effectiveness when evaluated on unseen data, while SSL models demonstrate greater resilience, losing only 10\% or even improving in some cases. This study also highlights the most promising and appropriate augmentations for PCG signal processing, by calculating their effect size on training. These insights equip researchers with valuable guidelines for developing reliable models in PCG signal processing.</description>

      <title>VoiceBench: Benchmarking LLM-Based Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the success of large language models (LLMs), recent advancements such as GPT-4o have enabled real-time speech interactions through LLM-based voice assistants, offering a significantly improved user experience compared to traditional text-based interactions. However, the absence of benchmarks designed to evaluate these speech interaction capabilities has hindered progress of LLM-based voice assistants development. Current evaluations focus primarily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) or general knowledge evaluation with clean speeches, neglecting the more intricate, real-world scenarios that involve diverse speaker characteristics, environmental and content factors. To address this, we introduce VoiceBench, the first benchmark designed to provide a multi-faceted evaluation of LLM-based voice assistants. VoiceBench also includes both real and synthetic spoken instructions that incorporate the above three key real-world variations. Extensive experiments reveal the limitations of current LLM-based voice assistant models and offer valuable insights for future research and development in this field.</description>

      <title>CHORDONOMICON: A Dataset of 666,000 Songs and their Chord Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chord progressions encapsulate important information about music, pertaining to its structure and conveyed emotions. They serve as the backbone of musical composition, and in many cases, they are the sole information required for a musician to play along and follow the music. Despite their importance, chord progressions as a data domain remain underexplored. There is a lack of large-scale datasets suitable for deep learning applications, and limited research exploring chord progressions as an input modality. In this work, we present Chordonomicon, a dataset of over 666,000 songs and their chord progressions, annotated with structural parts, genre, and release date - created by scraping various sources of user-generated progressions and associated metadata. We demonstrate the practical utility of the Chordonomicon dataset for classification and generation tasks, and discuss its potential to provide valuable insights to the research community. Chord progressions are unique in their ability to be represented in multiple formats (e.g. text, graph) and the wealth of information chords convey in given contexts, such as their harmonic function . These characteristics make the Chordonomicon an ideal testbed for exploring advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers, graph machine learning, and hybrid systems that combine knowledge representation and machine learning.</description>

      <title>EmoSpeech: A Corpus of Emotionally Rich and Contextually Detailed Speech Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the quality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the target speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional expression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle emotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech databases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to capture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of emotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have focussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to describe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more emotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel process aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich speech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions through a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of the database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual annotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language models. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable solution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing emotionally controlled TTS systems.</description>

      <title>Preserving Speaker Information in Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Non-Autoregressive Generation and Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) refers to the conversion of speech in one language into semantically equivalent speech in another language, facilitating communication between speakers of different languages. Speech-to-Discrete Unit Translation (S2UT), a mainstream approach for end-to-end S2ST, addresses challenges such as error propagation across modules and slow inference speed often encountered in traditional cascade systems. However, as discrete units primarily capture content information, conventional S2UT methods fail to retain speaker-specific characteristics from the source. Our previous work, SC-S2UT, introduced a speaker adapter and a unit-to-mel structure, enabling the preservation of speaker information and non-autoregressive speech generation. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a self-supervised pretraining method to enrich the information extracted by both the speaker adapter and the unit-to-mel structure. Additionally, we investigate different feature fusion strategies to further improve the integration of speaker and content features. Experiments conducted on the CVSS-T dataset for ES-EN and FR-EN tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a BLEU score improvement of 1.14 compared to SC-S2UT, along with significant enhancements in MOS and speaker similarity. Furthermore, our approach achieves translation quality comparable to traditional S2UT, with only a minimal increase of 0.04s per utterance in inference time, while maintaining high speaker similarity. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>
