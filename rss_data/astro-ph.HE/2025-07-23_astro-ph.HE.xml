      <title>A Late-time Radio Search for Highly Off-axis Jets from PTF Broad-lined Ic Supernovae in GRB-like Host Galaxy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen/Helium-poor stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae with broad lines (SNe Ic-bl) almost always accompany the nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) jetted relativistic explosions known as long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the majority of SNe Ic-bl have no detected GRB counterpart. At least some of these SNe should harbor off-axis jets, whose afterglow may become detectable at late times, particularly at radio wavelengths. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations (rest frame times of $\sim 3$-$4\times10^{3}$ days post SN discovery) of a sample of 14 SNe Ic-bl discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) that have been demonstrated to originate from the same host environments as the SNe Ic-bl associated with nearby GRBs. Of the 14 SNe, we identify three that are radio detected, one of which (PTF10tqv, $z = 0.0795$) is consistent with an off-axis jet with energy similar to classical GRBs ($\gtrsim 10^{50.5}~$erg). Using recently developed synchrotron radiation code, we find that for our 11 non-detections, which are among the deepest limits obtained for Ic-bl, we rule out an off-axis jet with an energy of $\gtrsim 10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ in circumburst densities of $\gtrsim 10^{-1}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We predict that well-spaced monitoring of newly discovered SNe Ic-bl from $\sim 10~$days to $\sim 10~$years (rest frame) to luminosities of $\sim 10^{27}~{\rm erg~s}^{-1}~{\rm Hz}^{-1}$ will constrain the existence of highly off-axis jets ($\gtrsim60^\circ$) with classical GRB energies. The VLA Sky Survey will probe jets that are $\lesssim 60^\circ$ off-axis, whereas the Deep Synpotic Array 2000 will probe jets out to $\sim 90^\circ$ off-axis, demonstrating the importance of utilizing radio surveys to supplement targeted observations.</description>

      <title>GRB 241105A: A test case for GRB classification and rapid r-process nucleosynthesis channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst's true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy's properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Relativistic X-ray reflection and thermonuclear burst from accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from the spectral and temporal study of thermonuclear bursts from the millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207 detected with NICER. The dynamic evolution of the spectral parameters in a broad energy range is also investigated during a simultaneously detected burst with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The burst profiles exhibit a strong energy dependence, as observed with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR. We investigated the reflection feature during these bursts using the disk reflection model. As observed during the peak of the NICER bursts, the reflection model can contribute 30 per cent of the overall emission. During the NICER bursts, a correlation is observed between the flux of the blackbody and the reflection components. The measurements of the mass accretion rate indicate that the bursts may be powered by a mixed H/He fuel. Moreover, the broadband NICER and NuSTAR spectra are also used to probe the reflection signature in the burst-free persistent region using the relativistic reflection model. Based on the variability of the count rate during the NuSTAR observation, we also investigate the evolution of spectral parameters during two different flux levels of the NuSTAR observation. The inner disk radius (Rin) and the angle of inclination are found to be nearly 11 Rg and 50 degrees, respectively. The magnetic field strength at the poles of the neutron star is estimated to be 6 x 10^8 G, assuming that the inner disk is truncated at the magnetospheric boundary.</description>

      <title>Prospects for GeV Neutrino Transient Searches with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of TeV neutrino sources by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory demonstrates the detector's advanced capabilities in detecting high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. At lower energies, down to the GeV range, a variety of transient phenomena, such as novae, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts, are expected to emit neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos can provide unique insights into processes below the photosphere and offer clues to identifying their emission mechanisms. We have searched for these neutrinos intensively with IceCube's existing infill array, DeepCore. Although no significant detections have been made, strong constraints on astrophysical environments in these transients, such as the baryon loading factor in gamma-ray bursts, have been obtained. A denser infill array, called the IceCube Upgrade, will enhance sub-TeV neutrino searches with its unprecedented sensitivity to GeV neutrinos. The Upgrade, set to be deployed in the 2025-2026 South Pole season, will consist of seven new strings, adding approximately 700 novel optical modules with multiple photomultiplier tubes in the DeepCore volume. The denser arrangement of high-efficiency modules will significantly improve IceCube's sensitivity between 1 GeV and 1 TeV. We present an initial assessment of the astrophysical capabilities of the IceCube Upgrade, using preliminary simulated data and an event selection similar to that used for DeepCore. We explore the detectability of GeV neutrino transients compared to DeepCore and discuss potential sensitivity enhancements through advanced detector simulations and optimized analysis techniques, including refined triggering conditions and event selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Can GRB Empirical Correlations Be Used for Population Studies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only a small fraction of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have independent redshift measurements, which are essential for understanding their intrinsic properties. For this reason, empirical correlations of GRBs have often been touted as useful distance indicators, for both individual GRBs as well as population studies. Building upon our previous work, we test the ability of the Yonetoku, 3D Dainotti, and the L-T-E correlation to adequately constrain the GRB rate, $\Psi_{GRB}$. Our analysis demonstrates that, even under idealized conditions that neglect substantial uncertainties, the derived redshift solutions cannot accurately constrain $\Psi_{GRB}$, regardless of the intrinsic distribution's characteristic width. We thus demonstrate unequivocally that -- notwithstanding the questionable assumption of no selection biases -- empirical GRB correlations alone cannot serve as reliable distance indicators at either the individual or population level.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra X-ray observation of the isolated black hole OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 is an isolated black hole of ~7 solar masses at a distance of 1.5 kpc identified thanks to the astrometric microlensing technique. It is the first specimen discovered of the large population of ~10^8 stellar-mass black holes that are believd to wander in the Galaxy. Electromagnetic radiation powered by accretion from the interstellar medium is expected from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, but has not been detected at any wavelength. We present the results of a deep pointed observation with the Chandra satellite that provides an upper limit of 3x10^29 erg/s on the luminosity of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 in the 0.5-7 keV energy range. This is about one order of magnitude below the previous limit obtained from shallower observations that serendipitously covered the sky position of this black hole. Our results are briefly compared with models of the source and with the X-ray upper limits for candidate isolated black holes and black holes in wide binary systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Volumetric Rate-Energy Relation from Magnetar Radio Bursts to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond radio pulses with extremely high bright temperature. Their physical origin is still a mystery. The discovery of FRB 20020428 supports the idea that at least a portion of FRBs is generated by magnetars. However, FRB 20200428 and other radio bursts of SGR 1935+2154 are much less energetic than that of extragalactic FRBs. Thus, whether the progenitors of extragalactic FRBs are magnetars is still in controversy. Here, we investigate the volumetric rates of radio bursts from SGR 1935+2154, non-repeating FRBs and FRB 20180916B using the uniform samples detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We find that they share a similar relation between the volumetric rate $R$ and the burst energy $E$, i.e., $R\propto E^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma=1.31\pm 0.13$ from $10^{29}$ erg to $10^{42}$ erg. Our results support the hypothesis that both repeating and non-repeating FRBs originate from magnetars.</description>

      <title>The Large Magellanic Cloud as a source of the highest energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has published properties of the 100 highest-energy cosmic ray events (to energies above 100 EeV) which it recorded over a 17 year period. We have examined the directional properties of these events and have taken particular note of the most energetically extreme events. We find that the most energetic events have directions which are grouped in a non-random way at the 1\% level. There is an apparent clustering in a limited region of the sky. Close to that direction is found Centaurus A, which has long been considered as a source of such particles, but we also note that a close-by dwarf galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is closer in angular terms. We examine the possibility that the LMC might be a source of observed cosmic rays at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Recent advances on multimessenger astrophysics: Centaurus A, GW 170817, and KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in multimessenger astrophysics, with particular emphasis on Centaurus A and on two pivotal events: the gravitational-wave detection GW 170817 and the ultra-high-energy neutrino KM3-230213A. Centaurus A is the prototype multimessenger source. The GW 170817 event, arising from a binary neutron star merger, marked a transformative moment in astronomy through the joint observation of gravitational waves and a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The KM3-230213A neutrino, detected by the KM3NeT Collaboration, is the most energetic neutrino observed to date and poses significant challenges for current models, given its tension with null results from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory. We assess astrophysical interpretations, including galactic, cosmogenic, and transient extragalactic sources, as well as implications for cosmic-ray acceleration. These cases underscore the scientific potential of high-energy multimessenger events in probing both the extreme universe and new physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of VER J2019+368 with the SST-1M stereoscopic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small Size Telescope (SST-1M) is a small Cherenkov telescope designed to detect gamma rays with energies more than about 1 TeV. The optical design of the SST-1M follows the Davies-Cotton concept to ensure good off-axis performance. In 2022, two SST-1M telescope prototypes were installed in Ondrejov, Czech Republic, and stereoscopic observations of astrophysical gamma-ray sources have been performed since then. VER J2019+368 is an unidentified very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, surrounded by several gamma-ray point-like and diffuse sources, together with their multi-wavelength counterparts. VHE emission was discovered by MILAGRO in 2012, followed by VERITAS observation, which revealed the complex morphology of the source. Recently, the LHAASO observatory detected photons with multi-TeV energies, opening up the possibility of particle acceleration up to PeV energies. In this contribution, we present preliminary results of the first observing campaign of the VER J2019+368 region, performed with SST-1M from April to November 2024. We present the data analysis, focusing on the morphological and spectroscopic study of the region. We also present the off-axis performance of SST-1M in the context of the prospects for detecting extended galactic gamma-ray sources. As one of the brightest and hardest sources in the LHAASO catalog, VER J2019+368 is an ideal candidate for testing the capabilities of the SST-1M, with its large field of view, to detect extended gamma-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Sometimes they come back: pulsations in A 0538-66 at 69 ms rediscovered with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on NICER X-ray observations of the Be X-ray binary A 0538-66 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Fast pulsations (69 ms) in this source were discovered in 1980 during a bright outburst in which it reached a luminosity of ~8E38 erg/s, but were never reobserved since then. We clearly detected the pulsations at P=69.3055 +/- 0.0005 ms with a pulsed fraction of ~20% during a short time interval (~11 minutes) on 2023 January 9, when A 0538-66 had a luminosity of ~8E36 erg/s (0.3-10 keV). The pulsations were not detected in other NICER observations (total exposure ~162.7 ks), during which A 0538-66 had a similar or lower luminosity. On 2023 February 8-9 the source exhibited a strong variability, with short flares reaching ~1E38 erg/s, but no periodic pulsations were detected. Assuming the magnetospheric radius lies within the corotation radius during pulsations, we estimate the neutron star magnetic field is below ~2.7E10 G. This would make A 0538-66 the high-mass X-ray binary with the weakest known magnetic field. We discuss implications for magnetic field evolution in accreting pulsars and propose that, alternatively, A 0538-66 has a stronger magnetic field and during the NICER detection, a centrifugal barrier may have been active while part of the plasma accumulated at the magnetosphere sporadically leaked through it via an instability mechanism, allowing accretion onto the polar caps.</description>

      <title>Very-high-energy observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 with MAGIC -- Indication of another gamma-ray obscured candidate neutrino source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seyfert galaxies are emerging as a promising source class of high-energy neutrinos. The Seyfert galaxies NGC 4151 and NGC 1068 have come up respectively as the most promising counterparts of a 3$\sigma$ and of a 4.2$\sigma$ neutrino excesses detected by IceCube in the TeV energy range. Constraining the very-high-energy (VHE) emission associated with the neutrino signal is crucial to unveil the mechanism and site of neutrino production. In this work, we present the first results of the VHE observations ($\sim$29 hours) of NGC 4151 with the MAGIC telescopes. We detect no gamma-ray excess in the direction of NGC 4151, and we derive constraining upper limits on the VHE gamma-ray flux. The integral flux upper limit (at the 95% confidence level) above 200 GeV is $f = 2.3 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The comparison of the MAGIC and IceCube measurements suggests the presence of a gamma-ray obscured accelerator, and it allows us to constrain the gamma-ray optical depth and the size of the neutrino production site.</description>

      <title>A $6.37\,{\rm Hz}$ quasi-periodic oscillating photospheric emission in GRB~240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM, we report the first detection of a high-confidence quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the thermal emission of gamma-ray burst GRB~240825A. The spectral analysis of the burst reveals two radiation components, including a thermal emission dominant in $100 \text{--} 300\,\mathrm{keV}$ and a non-thermal emission spanning a wide energy range. During the interval $2.07 \text{--} 3.25\,\mathrm{s}$ post-trigger, a strong QPO signal at $6.37\,\mathrm{Hz}$ ($\gtrsim 5\sigma$ confidence) is identified in the $100 \text{--} 300\,\mathrm{keV}$ thermal-dominated band. The variability analysis of the non-thermal component ($15 \text{--} 30\,\mathrm{keV}$) uncovered a $0.67\,\mathrm{Hz}$ QPO, consistent with light-curve modeling using periodic fast-rise exponential decay pulses. The strong QPO in the photospheric emission directly indicates a quasi-periodic oscillating jet. Together with the non-thermal emission variability, we show that this QPO can be explained in terms of a helical structure in the jet, where the viewing angle to the dominant emission region in the jet undergoes periodic changes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of newborn pulsars with high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newborn pulsars resulting from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are promising sources of high-energy (HE) cosmic rays and neutrinos. In this work, we focus on HE neutrinos generated by interactions between protons accelerated in relativistic pulsar winds and SN ejecta. Using a binned likelihood analysis, we evaluate the detection prospects of these neutrinos with IceCube and explore their potential for probing the initial spin period ($P$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) of newborn pulsars. Noticing a degeneracy in neutrino signal with $B/P^2$ across a broad parameter space, we find that HE neutrinos from a galactic newborn pulsar ($d=10$ kpc) with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.003$ can be detected at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ significance. Even in the absence of a nearby pulsar, the diffuse flux from the cosmologic population of pulsars could be probed by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND200k. For galactic pulsars with $(B/10^{12}~{\rm G})(P/{\rm ms})^{-2} \gtrsim 0.08$, the combination $B/P^2$ can be measured with an accuracy of better than 20\% at the $3\sigma$ confidence level. Additionally, we show that for pulsars with detectable HE neutrino signals, the emission can be clearly distinguished from neutrinos produced by interactions between SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium, due to their distinct temporal and spectral features.</description>

      <title>The Event Rate and Luminosity Function of Fermi/GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminosity function and event rate of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are easily biased by the instrument and selection effects. We select 115 Fermi/GBM GRBs with good spectra fitted by a smoothly broken power-law function. The $\tau$-statistic method is used to describe how the luminosity evolves with redshift. The non-parametric Lynden-Bell's c$^{-}$ method has been applied to get the cumulative luminosity function and event rate which is compared with the star formation history. How the selection and instrument effects bias the deduced event rate has been carefully studied. We find that the event rate always exceeds the star formation rate (SFR) at lower redshift and matches with each other at higher redshift, which is independent of energy bands and consistent with previous findings of other satellites. Furthermore, it is found that sample completeness does not affect the deduced event rate too much as mentioned for the Swift lGRBs in Dong et al.. A triple power-law function has been used to fit the cumulative flux distribution and categorize the total sample into three subsamples of bright, medium and faint GRBs. We find that the event rates of bright GRBs, unlike medium and faint ones, comply with the SFR ideally, which indicates that these bright GRBs with higher luminosity are possibly produced from the core-collapse of massive stars.</description>

      <title>Stereo performance of SST-1M at different altitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SST-1M telescopes are a pair of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) that have been operating at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory (510 m a.s.l.) in the Czech Republic since 2022. Optimized for detecting gamma rays in the energy range 1-300 TeV, they are capable of performing both mono and stereo observations. Despite challenging atmospheric conditions, SST-1M has successfully detected several galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources with energies reaching up to 200 TeV during its ongoing commissioning. In this study, we analyze the performance of the SST-1M telescopes at different locations to assess the impact of altitude and relative telescope spacing on their physics performance. The low-altitude site at 510 m a.s.l. has already been investigated using both Monte Carlo simulations and real data. For comparison, we selected an intermediate-altitude site at 1420 m a.s.l. corresponding to Pampa Amarilla in Argentina and a high-altitude site at 4270 m a.s.l. corresponding to Hanle in India - both of which offer favorable astronomical conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid concept of detection for a wide-field gamma-ray observatory using Cherenkov telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid detection approach in astroparticle physics has been successfully employed in cosmic-ray experiments and is currently being explored by gamma-ray observatories like LHAASO. We present a study on the hybrid detection concept for the future Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), integrating multiple Cherenkov telescopes represented in the analysis by Single-Mirror Small-Size imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (SST-1M) located next to the surface array of water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs). We discuss the mutual benefits of this hybrid approach and present simulation-based results on key performances. Our findings points to the fact that the combination of wide field-of-view and continuous operation of WCDs with the high angular and energy resolution of Cherenkov telescopes could significantly improve the overall detection capabilities of the SWGO experiment.</description>

      <title>A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>On the Image Profiles of Transients in the Palomar Sky Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VASCO project has discovered groups of short-lived transients on historical photographic plates that lack conventional explanation. Hambly &amp; Blair (2024) examined nine such transients reported by Villarroel (2021) and found that they exhibit narrower, rounder profiles, attributing this to emulsion flaws. However, well-established optical principles and atmospheric physics imply that unresolved flashes lasting less than a second naturally appear sharper and more circular than stellar images, particularly on long-exposure plates where stars are significantly blurred by seeing and tracking errors. Such profiles are an expected consequence of sub-second optical flashes, making their findings consistent with the transient interpretation.</description>

      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Wino and Real Minimal Dark Matter Excluded by Fermi Gamma-Ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n &lt; 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n &lt; 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Carbon burning cannot explain puffy hypervelocity white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant formation channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been extensively studied for many years. Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Red Supergiants as Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.</description>

      <title>dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>

      <title>Applying multimodal learning to Classify transient Detections Early (AppleCiDEr) I: Data set, methods, and infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) generate hundreds of thousands to millions of alerts, demanding automatic, unified classification of transients and variable stars for efficient follow-up. We present AppleCiDEr (Applying Multimodal Learning to Classify Transient Detections Early), a novel framework that integrates four key data modalities (photometry, image cutouts, metadata, and spectra) to overcome limitations of single-modality classification approaches. Our architecture introduces (i) two transformer encoders for photometry, (ii) a multimodal convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain-specialized metadata towers and Mixture-of-Experts fusion for combining metadata and images, and (iii) a CNN for spectra classification. Training on ~ 30,000 real ZTF alerts, AppleCiDEr achieves high accuracy, allowing early identification and suggesting follow-up for rare transient spectra. The system provides the first unified framework for both transient and variable star classification using real observational data, with seamless integration into brokering pipelines, demonstrating readiness for the LSST era.</description>

      <title>Probing Double-Peaked Gamma-Ray Spectra from Primordial Black Holes with Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to form in the early universe from gravitational collapse of density fluctuations, represent a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. Their potential detection through gamma-ray signatures arising from Hawking radiation would provide definitive evidence for their existence and constrain their contribution to the DM abundance. Unlike conventional DM candidates, PBHs emit a unique, thermal-like spectrum of particles as they evaporate, including photons, neutrinos, and possible beyond-the-Standard Model particles. Future high-sensitivity gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM and other next-generation telescopes, will play a pivotal role in this search. With improved energy resolution and sensitivity, these missions can disentangle PBH-originating photons from astrophysical backgrounds, probe subtle spectral features such as multi-peak structures, and test exotic evaporation models. Such observations could either confirm PBHs as a viable DM component or place stringent limits on their abundance across critical mass windows. In this work, we explore the distinguishing features of a double-peaked gamma-ray spectrum produced by PBHs, focusing on the asteroid-mass window ($10^{15}$ g to $10^{17}$ g), where Hawking radiation peaks in the MeV to GeV range. Using a likelihood-based analysis, we demonstrate how future missions could discriminate between single- and double-peaked PBH scenarios, the latter arising in cosmological models predicting multi-modal PBH mass distributions. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of spectral shape analysis in identifying PBH populations and constrain the parameter space for which a double-peaked signal could be detectable above background.</description>

      <title>Intra-night optical variability and radio characteristics of extremely radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are generally known to be radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), but a tiny subset of them are found to be extremely radio-loud with radio loudness parameter ($R_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) $&gt;$ 100. Given their rarity we investigated intra-night optical variability (INOV) and radio characteristics of a sample of 16 extremely radio-loud NLS1s. For all but four sample sources we report intra-night photometric monitoring for the first time with at least one monitoring session per source lasting for a minimum of 3.0 hours duration. In our sample, we detect INOV with a high duty cycle (up to 25 per cent) and large average amplitude ($\overline{\psi}$ $\sim$ 0.16) similar to that found in blazars. Using 3.0 GHz Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and auxiliary multi-frequency radio data we find that our RL-NLS1s are luminous ($L_{\rm 3.0~GHz}$ $\geq$ 10$^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$), compact (less than a few kpc), variable, flat spectrum (${\alpha}_{\rm radio}$ $&gt;$ -0.5) radio sources. The INOV, radio characteristics, and radio luminosity ($L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}$) versus super-massive black hole mass ($M_{\rm SMBH}$) plot infer that extremely radio-loud NLS1s are low-$z$ and low-luminosity analogs of flat spectrum radio quasars wherein the former are powered by, on average, one order-of-magnitude less massive SMBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) is an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope designed for detecting very high-energy gamma rays. With a compact design achieved through the adoption of silicon-photomultiplier pixels and a lightweight structure, SST-1M offers a large field of view of about 9{\deg} and features a mirror system of 4 m diameter with an optical PSF (at 80% of photon inclusion) of 0.08{\deg} on axis and 0.21{\deg} at 4{\deg} off-axis, and a fully digitizing readout almost deadtime free up to few kHz. The SST-1M achieved a high-performance and cost-effective solution for implementing an array of small-sized telescopes. The stereoscopic system of two SST-1Ms is temporarily installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory in the Czech Republic. From an altitude of only about 510 m and in harsh meteorological conditions, the system is detecting galactic sources and flares of AGNs. The accurate calibration of the detector and the simulation benchmark are ongoing. The results of its performance are shown. A future final location is being considered and a future performance outlook is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dark matter explanations for the neutrino emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the high-energy neutrino flux observed from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 originates from dark matter annihilations within the density spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at its center. The comparatively lower gamma-ray flux is attributed to a dark sector that couples predominantly to Standard Model neutrinos. To explain the absence of a corresponding neutrino signal from the center of the Milky Way, we propose two scenarios: (i) the disruption of the dark matter spike at the Milky Way center due to stellar heating, or (ii) the annihilation into a dark scalar that decays exclusively into neutrinos, with a decay length longer than the size of the Milky Way but shorter than the distance from Earth to NGC 1068.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of axion echoes in the context of multiple ALP models. We begin by reviewing the single ALP case, deriving the conditions for resonance and echo formation. Starting from a set of N ALPs coupling to the photon, we then derive the relevant echo equations for both coherent and incoherent configurations. In the former case, we show that the echo power scales with N leading to sharper amplification and potentially improving projected bounds discussed earlier in literature. Small mass splittings between the ALPs further increase this amplification, even for a N = 2 case. We also outline the potential experimental implications of our results and discuss prospects for detecting these echoes in a wide range of ALP masses. In the incoherent scenario, we show that the random phases lead to a suppression of the echo power, eventually resulting in observable signals akin to or even weaker than the single ALP case.</description>

Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in the magnetosphere of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Alpha clustering in warm and dense nuclear matter from heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although light nuclear clusters are known to affect the properties of warm and dilute nuclear matter, their role in warm and dense nuclear matter remains unclear due to the lack of experimental evidence for their modifications by the Mott effect in such an environment. To address this issue, we resort to intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, where light clusters are mainly produced in the transiently formed warm and dense matter. A kinetic approach, which includes dynamically the formation and dissociation of light clusters, is employed to deduce the strength of the Mott effects and the $\alpha$-particle fraction in warm and dense nuclear matter from the light-nuclei yields measured by the FOPI Collaboration in central Au$+$Au collisions at energies of $0.25A$ to $0.6A~\rm GeV$. We find an unexpectedly abundant $\alpha$ clustering in this environment, which will have profound implications for modeling the nuclear equation of state and describing supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass-Dispersion Measure Correlations Constrain Baryonic Feedback in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low redshift fast radio bursts (FRBs) provide robust measurements of the host-galaxy contribution to the dispersion measure (DM), which can constrain the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the hosts. We curate a sample of 20 nearby FRBs with low scattering timescales and face-on host galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^9 &lt; M^* / M_\odot &lt; 10^{11}$. We fit the distribution of the host galaxy DM to a quadratic model as a function of stellar mass with a mass-independent scatter and find that the more massive the host, the lower its host DM. We report that this relation has a negative slope of $m = -97 \pm 44$ pc/cm$^{-3}$ per dex in stellar mass. We compare this measurement to similar fits to three sub-grid models implemented in the CAMELS suite of simulations from Astrid, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA and find that fine-tuning of the host ISM contribution as a function of stellar mass is required in order to reconcile the observational data with the predictions of the fiducial CAMELS-Astrid model. More generally, models which attribute a positive correlation between stellar mass and host dispersion measure ($m &gt; 0$) to the CGM are in tension with our measurement. We show that this conclusion is robust to a wide range of assumptions, such as the offset distribution of FRBs from their hosts and the statistics of the cosmic contribution to the DM budget along each sightline. Our results indirectly imply a lower limit on the strength of baryonic feedback in the Local Universe $(z &lt; 0.2)$ in isolated $\sim L^*$ halos, complementing results from weak lensing surveys and kSZ observations which target higher halo mass and redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Expert Variational Autoencoders for Cross-Modality Embedding of Type Ia Supernova Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics relies on heterogeneous and multi-modal data. Specialized models are often constructed to extract information from a single modality, but this approach ignores the wealth of cross-modality information that may be relevant for the tasks to which the model is applied. In this work, we propose a multi-modal, mixture-of-expert variational autoencoder to learn a joint embedding for supernova light curves and spectra. Our method, which is inspired by the Perceiver architecture, natively accommodates variable-length inputs and the irregular temporal sampling inherent to supernova light curves. We train our model on radiative transfer simulations and validate its performance on cross-modality reconstruction of supernova spectra and physical parameters from the simulation. Our model achieves superior performance in cross-modality generation to nearest-neighbor searches in a contrastively-trained latent space, showing its promise for constructing informative latent representations of multi-modal astronomical datasets.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Extended Hydrogen-Poor CSM in the Three-Peaked Light Curve of Stripped Envelope Ib Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-band ATLAS photometry for SN 2019tsf, a stripped-envelope Type Ib supernova (SESN). The SN shows a triple-peaked light curve and a late (re-)brightening, making it unique among stripped-envelope systems. The re-brightening observations represent the latest photometric measurements of a multi-peaked Type Ib SN to date. As late-time photometry and spectroscopy suggest no hydrogen, the potential circumstellar material (CSM) must be H-poor. Moreover, late (&gt;150 days) spectra show no signs of narrow emission lines, further disfavouring CSM interaction. On the contrary, an extended CSM structure is seen through a follow-up radio campaign with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), indicating a source of bright optically thick radio emission at late times, which is highly unusual among H-poor SESNe. We attribute this phenomenology to an interaction of the supernova ejecta with spherically-asymmetric CSM, potentially disk-like, and we present several models that can potentially explain the origin of this rare Type Ib supernova. The warped disc model paints a novel picture, where the tertiary companion perturbs the progenitors CSM, that can explain the multi-peaked light curves of SNe, and here we apply it to SN 2019tsf. This SN 2019tsf is likely a member of a new sub-class of Type Ib SNe and among the recently discovered class of SNe that undergo mass transfer at the moment of explosion</description>

      <title>Multi-Zone Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback in 3D GRMHD: Bridging Vast Spatial and Temporal Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating accretion and feedback from the horizon scale of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) out to galactic scales is challenging because of the vast range of scales involved. Elaborating on H. Cho et al., we describe and test a "multizone" technique, which is designed to tackle this difficult problem in three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. While short-timescale variability should be interpreted with caution, the method is demonstrated to be well-suited for finding dynamical steady states over a wide dynamic range. We simulate accretion on a nonspinning SMBH ($a_* = 0$) using initial conditions and the external galactic potential from a large-scale galaxy simulation and achieve a steady state over eight decades in radius. As found in H. Cho et al., the density scales with radius as $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ inside the Bondi radius $R_B$, which is located at $R_B=2\times 10^5 \,r_g$ ($\approx 60\,{\rm pc}$ for M87), where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the SMBH; the plasma-$\beta$ is ~ unity, indicating an extended magnetically arrested state; the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is $\approx 1\%$ of the analytical Bondi accretion rate $\dot{M}_B$ and there is continuous energy feedback out to $\approx 100R_B$ (or beyond $&gt;\,{\rm kpc}$) at a rate $\approx 0.02 \dot{M}c^2$. Surprisingly, no ordered rotation in the external medium survives as the magnetized gas flows to smaller radii, and the final steady solution is very similar to when the exterior has no rotation. Using the multizone method, we simulate GRMHD accretion over a wide range of Bondi radii, $R_{\rm B} \sim 10^2 - 10^7\,r_{\rm g}$, and find that $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\approx (R_B/6\, r_g)^{-0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulations of the cosmic ray pressure anisotropy instability: cosmic ray scattering rate in the saturated state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback plays a vital role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies through their interaction with magnetohydrodynamic waves. In the CR self-confinement scenario, the waves are generated by the CR gyro-resonant instabilities via CR streaming or CR pressure anisotropy, and saturate by balancing wave damping. The resulting effective particle scattering rate by the waves, {\nu}eff, critically sets the coupling between the CRs and background gas, but the efficiency of CR feedback is yet poorly constrained. We employ 1D kinetic simulations under the Magnetohydrodynamic-Particle-In-Cell (MHD-PIC) framework with the adaptive {\delta}f method to quantify {\nu}eff for the saturated state of the CR pressure anisotropy instability (CRPAI) with ion-neutral friction. We drive CR pressure anisotropy by expanding/compressing box, mimicking background evolution of magnetic field strength, and the CR pressure anisotropy eventually reaches a quasi-steady state by balancing quasi-linear diffusion. At the saturated state, we measure {\nu}eff and the CR pressure anisotropy level, establishing a calibrated scaling relation with environmental parameters. The scaling relation is consistent with quasi-linear theory and can be incorporated to CR fluid models, in either the single-fluid or p-by-p treatments. Our results serve as a basis towards accurately calibrating the subgrid physics in macroscopic studies of CR feedback and transport.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than 10 Myr follow a log-normal distribution with $\mu=5.60\pm0.12$ and $\sigma=0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}$150--200 km/s, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below 40 Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with $\mu=5.67\pm0.10$ and $\sigma=0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair annihilation driven jets from black-hole torus systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform axisymmetric general relativistic radiation-viscous hydrodynamics simulations of black hole (BH)-torus systems with full Boltzmann Monte-Carlo neutrino transport to investigate the role of neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation in launching relativistic outflows. Our models span a wide range of BH spins, torus masses, and viscosity parameters. We find that the pair annihilation leads to the formation of relativistic fireballs in most cases, except for those with low black-hole spin and high viscosity. The isotropic-equivalent energies of these outflows reach $\lesssim 10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$ with durations $\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm s}$. While this is insufficient to explain the brightest short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), our results suggest that the pair annihilation may account for some low-luminosity sGRBs and GRB precursors. We also provide updated scaling relations for the pair annihilation energy deposition rate as a function of accretion rate, and discuss the sensitivity of outflow properties to numerical resolution and floor density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the various classes of fast optical transients (FOTs), kilonovae (KNe), which can emerge as a result of neutron star mergers, are extremely challenging to observe because of not only the rapid timescale on which they fade (on the order of days), but also due to the relative scarcity of their occurrence. This scarcity is compounded by the large number of other FOTs that may initially resemble the characteristic rise of a KNe. While these objects can be ruled out as candidate KNe by taking spectroscopy, a method of confidently ruling out transients based on photometric analysis alone would be incredibly valuable. We describe the compilation of various "imposter" transients, including a plurality of IIb SNe, and investigate a number of comparative metrics by which one might be able to remove transients from consideration without the use of spectroscopy. We provide a list of these objects and their classifications as well as a glossary of the transient types included in the sample.</description>

      <title>Detection of positron in-flight annihilation from the Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the annihilation of positrons towards the Galactic centre was established more than 50 years ago through the detection of a 511 keV $\gamma$-ray line, the origin of the positrons remains unknown. The $\gamma$-ray line should be accompanied by continuum emission from positron in-flight annihilation, which, until now, has not been detected. We aim to detect positron in-flight annihilation emission, as it provides information on the kinetic energy of the positrons that is key in determining the origin of Galactic positrons. We analysed archival data obtained by the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory satellite to search for positron in-flight annihilation emission in the MeV energy range. Our analysis revealed extended emission in the MeV energy range towards the bulge of the Galaxy, which we attribute to in-flight annihilation of positrons produced with kinetic energies of $\sim$2 MeV. The observed spectrum suggests that positrons are produced quasi-mono-energetically, which could occur by the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses of $\sim$3 MeV, or through bulk motion in the jet of the microquasar 1E1740.7-2942. We furthermore detected a point-like emission component in the MeV energy range towards the Galactic centre that is the plausible low-energy counterpart of the Fermi-LAT source 4FGLJ1745.6-2859. The broad band spectrum of the source may be explained by the injection of pair plasma from the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^\ast$ into the interstellar medium, which would also explain the point-like 511 keV line emission component that was discovered by INTEGRAL/SPI at the Galactic centre. The observed positron in-flight annihilation spectrum towards the Galactic bulge excludes $\beta^+$ decays from radioactive isotopes, as well as any mechanism producing highly relativistic positrons as the origin of the Galactic bulge positrons.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate G118.4+37.0 associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT ~ 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and O abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kyr old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinct "Clump" region shows hard emission equally well described by a thermal (kT ~ 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma ~ 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Halpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Quadrupolar Nature of Gravitational Wave Background through Space-based Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) consists of an incoherent collection of waves from both astrophysical and cosmological sources. To distinguish the SGWB from noise, it is essential to verify its quadrupolar nature, exemplified by the cross-correlations among pairs of pulsars within a pulsar timing array, commonly referred to as the Hellings-Downs curve. We study how this quadrupolar signature manifests in correlations between general GW detector pairs, characterized by their antenna responses. Focusing on space-based missions including laser interferometers (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) and atom interferometers (AEDGE/MAGIS), we demonstrate how orbital motion dynamically modulates detector correlations through time-dependent separations and relative orientation shifts. These modulations encode unique statistical features that serve as definitive markers of the SGWB's quadrupolar nature. Our findings identify optimal configurations for these missions, offer forecasts for the time needed to identify the quadrupolar nature of the SGWB, and are applicable to both space-space and space-terrestrial correlations.</description>

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with POMPOCO: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>

Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high-density matter blobs that developed due to these fluctuations. We study here such a collapse, which are seeded by a scalar field $\phi$ associated to a non-trivial potential function $V(\phi)$, minimally coupled to gravity. Such a continual collapse is presumed to form a black hole always and is named a primordial black hole (PBH). Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the scalar field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) falls within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Neural Networks: Emulating Late Burning Stages in Core Collapse Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in modeling massive stars to the onset of core collapse is the computational bottleneck of nucleosynthesis during advanced burning stages. The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of fully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the simulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To overcome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with multiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a proof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature, density and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting isotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We generate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core depletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the predictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that the NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\:\%$, the average atomic and mass numbers by $150-360 \%$ and the nuclear energy generation by $250-750\:\%$, consistently outperforming the small network across all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of neutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from $100-10^{6}\:\%$. While further work is needed to enhance their accuracy and applicability to different stellar conditions, integrating NNN trained models into stellar evolution codes is promising for facilitating large-scale generation of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors with higher physical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Rotating Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Black Hole as a Particle Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similar to particle accelerators, black holes also have the ability to accelerate particles, generating significant amounts of energy through particle collisions. In this study, we examine the horizon and spacetime structures of a rotating black hole within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravity. Additionally, we extend the analysis to explore particle collisions and energy extraction near this black hole using the Banados-Silk-West mechanism. Our findings reveal that the mass and angular momentum of the colliding particles significantly influence the center of mass energy, more so than the parameters of the black hole itself. Furthermore, we apply the Banados-Silk-West mechanism to massless particles, particularly photons, while disregarding their intrinsic spin in plasma; an aspect that has not been previously explored. The Banados-Silk-West mechanism cannot be directly applied, as the refractive index condition only permits photon propagation, meaning that massive particles in vacuum cannot be included in this study. We derive the propagation conditions for photons and analyze photon collisions by treating them as massive particles in a dispersive medium. The impact of the plasma parameter on the extracted center of mass energy is also examined. Our results show that the plasma parameter has a relatively weak and unchanged effect on the center of mass energy across all cases, indicating that energy losses due to friction within the medium are a contributing factor.</description>

      <title>Detectability of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a black hole cluster in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evolve for the first time in full general relativity a small, collisional N-body black hole cluster of arbitrary total mass M. The bound cluster is initially compact (radius R/M~10), stable, and consists of 25 equal-mass, nonspinning black holes. The dynamical interactions of compact objects in N-body clusters is of great interest for the formation of black holes in the upper mass gap as well as intermediate and supermassive black holes. These are potential sources of gravitational waves that may be detected by both current and future observatories. Unlike previous N-body Newtonian and post-Newtonian simulations, no "subgrid physics" is required to handle collisions and mergers. We can therefore confirm in full general relativity several predictions from these simulations and analytic estimates: the runaway growth of a large black hole via repeated mergers; spindown of the central black hole with increasing captures; the ejection of a black hole with a large asymptotic velocity due to a several-body interaction; and a regime where mergers occur primarily via direct collisions on highly eccentric orbits instead of quasicircular inspirals. We extract the gravitational wave signal and find it has several distinct features associated with the compact cluster regime. Our results suggest the signal is sufficiently loud that next generation observatories would likely be able to detect similar events across most of the observable universe. This work is a preliminary proof-of-principle study that we hope will open up a new arena for numerical relativity and the study of N-body compact systems.</description>

      <title>Galactic double neutron stars as dual-line gravitational-wave sources: Prospects with LISA and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems could serve as intriguing dual-line gravitational-wave (GW) sources, emitting both high- and low-frequency GWs, arising respectively from the asymmetric spinning bodies of individual neutron stars (NSs) and the binary orbital inspiral. Detecting such dual-line signals could provide novel perspectives on binary orbital geometry and NS internal physics. We expand upon previously calculated spinning NS waveforms by incorporating higher-order terms of NS structural parameters. A population simulation is performed for spinning NS components in DNS systems potentially detectable by the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on 4-year LISA observation of 35 resolvable DNS systems under an optimistic scenario, we estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by the next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer, under log-uniform (uniform) sampling of NS structural parameters. For these dual-line sources, the median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is approximately 20--30. Through the dual-line GW detection strategy, the relative measurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $\sim 8\%$.</description>
