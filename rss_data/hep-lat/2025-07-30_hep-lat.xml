      <title>The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.</description>

      <title>Triad Representation for the Anisotropic Tensor Renormalization Group in Four Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm in higher dimensions is an important and urgent task, as the TRG is expected to provide a way to overcome the sign problem in lattice QCD calculations at finite density. One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking in Georgi-Glashow chiral-gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical symmetry breaking in a class of chiral gauge theories containing the Georgi-Glashow model. These theories feature a gauge sector and two fermion species that transform in the two-index antisymmetric and antifundamental representations with different multiplicities. Using the effective action formalism and the functional renormalization group, we derive the flow of four-fermion interactions that encode their resonant structure and information about bound-state formation. Generalizing the theories to multiple generations, we make contact with the loss of asymptotic freedom and dissect the boundary of a conjectured conformal window. Our results show that, while most of the theory space displays a dominant color-breaking condensate, there exists a strongly coupled regime where the lowest-laying mechanisms fail and more intricate dynamics are expected to arise. This analysis provides a first step toward the infrared behavior of chiral gauge theories with functional methods.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T&lt;T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i&lt;0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*&gt;0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of a QCD critical point and structure of the Columbia plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quark-mass dependence of the QCD critical point at varying bare up/down quark masses with fixed strange quark mass. We explore the corresponding second-order critical surface in the three-dimensional Columbia plot and study the extension of the associated crossover hyperplane at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential. To this end, we employ a by now well-tested combination of lattice Yang--Mills theory and a (truncated) version of Dyson--Schwinger equations at $N_f=2+1$ quark flavours. We find evidence for a positive curvature of the second order surface at (large) real chemical potential and a crossover region for imaginary chemical potential. Our results support the notion of a tricritical point at finite chemical potential in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Unveils the Power Law of Finite-Volume Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-volume extrapolation is an important step for extracting physical observables from lattice calculations. However, it is a significant challenge for the system with long-range interactions. We employ symbolic regression to regress finite-volume extrapolation formula for both short-range and long-range interactions. The regressed formula still holds the exponential form with a factor $L^n$ in front of it. The power decreases with the decreasing range of the force. When the range of the force becomes sufficiently small, the power converges to $-1$, recovering the short-range formula as expected. Our work represents a significant advancement in leveraging machine learning to probe uncharted territories within particle physics.</description>
