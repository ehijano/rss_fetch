      <title>High-resolution closed-loop seismic inversion network in time-frequency phase mixed domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin layers and reservoirs may be concealed in areas of low seismic reflection amplitude, making them difficult to recognize. Deep learning (DL) techniques provide new opportunities for accurate impedance prediction by establishing a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and impedance. However, existing methods primarily use time domain seismic data, which limits the capture of frequency bands, thus leading to insufficient resolution of the inversion results. To address these problems, we introduce a new time-frequency-phase (TFP) mixed-domain closed-loop seismic inversion network (TFP-CSIN) to improve the identification of thin layers and reservoirs. First, the inversion network and closed-loop network are constructed by using bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling bidirectional mapping between seismic data and impedance data. Next, to comprehensive learning across the entire frequency spectrum, the Fourier transform is used to capture frequency information and establish frequency domain constraints. At the same time, the phase domain constraint is introduced through Hilbert transformation, which improves the method's ability to recognize the weak reflection region features. Both experiments on the synthetic data show that TFP-CSIN outperforms the traditional supervised learning method and time domain semi-supervised learning methods in seismic inversion. The field data further verify that the proposed method improves the identification ability of weak reflection areas and thin layers.</description>

      <title>Modelling parametric uncertainty in PDEs models via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an approach enabling one to employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for uncertainty quantification. Our approach is applicable to systems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical situations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed neural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain across which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a unique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We employ a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate high-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU in a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing its reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU emerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte Carlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Controllable seismic velocity synthesis using generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate seismic velocity estimations are vital to understanding Earth's subsurface structures, assessing natural resources, and evaluating seismic hazards. Machine learning-based inversion algorithms have shown promising performance in regional (i.e., for exploration) and global velocity estimation, while their effectiveness hinges on access to large and diverse training datasets whose distributions generally cover the target solutions. Additionally, enhancing the precision and reliability of velocity estimation also requires incorporating prior information, e.g., geological classes, well logs, and subsurface structures, but current statistical or neural network-based methods are not flexible enough to handle such multi-modal information. To address both challenges, we propose to use conditional generative diffusion models for seismic velocity synthesis, in which we readily incorporate those priors. This approach enables the generation of seismic velocities that closely match the expected target distribution, offering datasets informed by both expert knowledge and measured data to support training for data-driven geophysical methods. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method through training diffusion models on the OpenFWI dataset under various conditions, including class labels, well logs, reflectivity images, and the combination of these priors. The performance of the approach under out-of-distribution conditions further underscores its generalization ability, showcasing its potential to provide tailored priors for velocity inverse problems and create specific training datasets for machine learning-based geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>
