      <title>Improving the Equation of Exchange for Cryptoasset Valuation Using Empirical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving domain of cryptocurrency markets, accurate token valuation remains a critical aspect influencing investment decisions and policy development. Whilst the prevailing equation of exchange pricing model offers a quantitative valuation approach based on the interplay between token price, transaction volume, supply, and either velocity or holding time, it exhibits intrinsic shortcomings. Specifically, the model may not consistently delineate the relationship between average token velocity and holding time. This paper aims to refine this equation, enhancing the depth of insight into token valuation methodologies.</description>

      <title>Robust automated calcification meshing for biomechanical cardiac digital twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcification has significant influence over cardiovascular diseases and interventions. Detailed characterization of calcification is thus desired for predictive modeling, but calcified heart meshes for physics-driven simulations are still often reconstructed using manual operations. This poses a major bottleneck for large-scale adoption of computational simulations for research or clinical use. To address this, we propose an end-to-end automated meshing algorithm that enables robust incorporation of patient-specific calcification onto a given heart mesh. The algorithm provides a substantial speed-up from several hours of manual meshing to $\sim$1 minute of automated computation, and it solves an important problem that cannot be addressed with recent template registration-based heart meshing techniques. We validated our final calcified heart meshes with extensive simulations, demonstrating our ability to accurately model patient-specific aortic stenosis and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement. Our method may serve as an important tool for accelerating the development and usage of physics-driven simulations for cardiac digital twins.</description>

      <title>Modeling of progressive high-cycle fatigue in composite laminates accounting for local stress ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework for simulating progressive failure under high-cycle fatigue loading is validated against experiments of composite quasi-isotropic open-hole laminates. Transverse matrix cracking and delamination are modeled with a mixed-mode fatigue cohesive zone model, covering crack initiation and propagation. Furthermore, XFEM is used for simulating transverse matrix cracks and splits at arbitrary locations. An adaptive cycle jump approach is employed for efficiently simulating high-cycle fatigue while accounting for local stress ratio variations in the presence of thermal residual stresses. The cycle jump scheme is integrated in the XFEM framework, where the local stress ratio is used to determine the insertion of cracks and to propagate fatigue damage. The fatigue cohesive zone model is based on S-N curves and requires static material properties and only a few fatigue parameters, calibrated on simple fracture testing specimens. The simulations demonstrate a good correspondence with experiments in terms of fatigue life and damage evolution.</description>

      <title>Survival probability of structures under fatigue: a data-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the probabilistic nature of fatigue life in structures subjected to cyclic loading with variable amplitude. Drawing on the formalisation of Miner's cumulative damage rule that we introduced in the recent article [Cartiaux, Ehrlacher, Legoll, Libal and Reygner, Prob. Eng. Mech. 2023], we apply our methodology to estimate the survival probability of an industrial structure using experimental data. The study considers both the randomness in the initial state of the structure and in the amplitude of loading cycles. The results indicate that the variability of loading cycles can be captured through the concept of deterministic equivalent damage, providing a computationally efficient method for assessing the fatigue life of the structure. Furthermore, the article highlights that the usual combination of Miner's rule and of the weakest link principle systematically overestimates the structure's fatigue life. On the case study that we consider, this overestimation reaches a multiplicative factor of more than two. We then describe how the probabilistic framework that we have introduced offers a remedy to this overestimation.</description>

      <title>MambaLithium: Selective state space model for remaining-useful-life, state-of-health, and state-of-charge estimation of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, lithium-ion batteries occupy a pivotal position in the realm of electric vehicles and the burgeoning new energy industry. Their performance is heavily dependent on three core states: remaining-useful-life (RUL), state-of-health (SOH), and state-of-charge (SOC). Given the remarkable success of Mamba (Structured state space sequence models with selection mechanism and scan module, S6) in sequence modeling tasks, this paper introduces MambaLithium, a selective state space model tailored for precise estimation of these critical battery states. Leveraging Mamba algorithms, MambaLithium adeptly captures the intricate aging and charging dynamics of lithium-ion batteries. By focusing on pivotal states within the battery's operational envelope, MambaLithium not only enhances estimation accuracy but also maintains computational robustness. Experiments conducted using real-world battery data have validated the model's superiority in predicting battery health and performance metrics, surpassing current methods. The proposed MambaLithium framework is potential for applications in advancing battery management systems and fostering sustainable energy storage solutions.

      <title>Rediscovering the Mullins Effect With Deep Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mullins effect represents a softening phenomenon observed in rubber-like materials and soft biological tissues. It is usually accompanied by many other inelastic effects like for example residual strain and induced anisotropy. In spite of the long term research and many material models proposed in literature, accurate modeling and prediction of this complex phenomenon still remain a challenging task.
  In this work, we present a novel approach using deep symbolic regression (DSR) to generate material models describing the Mullins effect in the context of nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials. The two step framework first identifies a strain energy function describing the primary loading. Subsequently, a damage function characterizing the softening behavior under cyclic loading is identified. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through benchmark tests using the generalized the Mooney-Rivlin and the Ogden-Roxburgh model. The generalizability and robustness of the presented framework are thoroughly studied. In addition, the proposed methodology is extensively validated on a temperature-dependent data set, which demonstrates its versatile and reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human albumin is essential for indicating the body's overall health. Accurately predicting plasma albumin levels and determining appropriate doses are urgent clinical challenges, particularly in critically ill patients, to maintain optimal blood levels. However, human albumin prediction is non-trivial that has to leverage the dynamics of biochemical markers as well as the experience of treating patients. Moreover, the problem of distribution shift is often encountered in real clinical data, which may lead to a decline in the model prediction performance and reduce the reliability of the model's application. In this paper, we propose a framework named Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction (DyG-HAP), which is able to provide accurate albumin predictions for Intensity Care Unit (ICU) patients during hospitalization. We first model human albumin prediction as a dynamic graph regression problem to model the dynamics and patient relationship. Then, we propose a disentangled dynamic graph attention mechanism to capture and disentangle the patterns whose relationship to labels under distribution shifts is invariant and variant respectively. Last, we propose an invariant dynamic graph regression method to encourage the model to rely on invariant patterns to make predictions. Moreover, we propose a dataset named Albumin level testing and nutritional dosing data for Intensive Care (ANIC) for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to several baseline methods in human albumin prediction.</description>
