      <title>Precise interpretations of traditional fine-tuning measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover two precise interpretations of traditional electroweak fine-tuning (FT) measures that were historically missed. (i) a statistical interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the change in plausibility of a model in which a parameter was exchanged for the $Z$ boson mass relative to an untuned model in light of the $Z$ boson mass measurement. (ii) an information-theoretic interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the exponential of the extra information, measured in nats, relative to an untuned model that you must supply about a parameter in order to fit the $Z$ mass. We derive the mathematical results underlying these interpretations, and explain them using examples from weak scale supersymmetry. These new interpretations shed fresh light on historical and recent studies using traditional FT measures.</description>

      <title>Clarifying the effect of mean subtraction on Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03607v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any autonomous nonlinear dynamical system can be viewed as a superposition of infinitely many linear processes, through the so-called Koopman mode decomposition. Its data-driven approximation- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)- has been extensively developed and deployed across a plethora of fields. In this work, we study the effect of subtracting the temporal mean on the DMD approximation, for observables possessing only a finite number of Koopman modes.
  Pre-processing time-sequential training data by removing the temporal mean has been a point of contention in the Companion matrix formulation of DMD. This stems from the potential of said pre-processing to render DMD equivalent to a temporal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). We prove that this equivalence is impossible when the training data is linearly consistent and the order of the DMD approximation exceeds the number of Koopman modes. Since model order and training set size are synonymous in this variant of DMD, the parity of DMD and DFT can, therefore, be indicative of inadequate training data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence based on effective information(EI) suggests that complex systems may exhibit a phenomenon called causal emergence(CE), where the macro-dynamics demonstrate a stronger causal effect than the micro-dynamics. However, a challenge in this theory is the dependence on the method used to coarse-grain the system. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this and singular value decomposition. Our research not only reveals a strong correlation between the proximity of a Markov chain being dynamically reversible and EI in assessing causal effects across various scenarios but also demonstrates that EI is constrained by the logarithm of the approximate dynamical reversibility. Leveraging this concept, we present an innovative approach to quantifying CE that is agnostic to specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the inherent characteristics of Markov dynamics. Through empirical evaluations on examples of boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks, we validate our refined CE definition.</description>
