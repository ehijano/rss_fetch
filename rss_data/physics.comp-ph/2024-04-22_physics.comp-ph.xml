      <title>Scale-bridging within a complex model hierarchy for investigation of a metal-fueled circular energy economy by use of Bayesian model calibration with model error quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reactor network (CRN) modeling is a promising approach for scale-bridging within a model hierarchy covering a huge range of scales from micro to macro in the scope of developing an innovative metal-fueled circular energy economy. This holds if valid information from CRNs, being models of reduced complexity, can be obtained on a much denser set of operating conditions than available from experiments and elaborated simulation methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). An approach for CRN calibration including model error quantification from recent literature is used for developing a CRN model of a laboratory reactor for flash ironmaking, using data from the literature. By introducing a meta model of a CRN parameter, it has been possible to calibrate a simple CRN model on an extended set of operating conditions with satisfactory results. This way, the employed coupled calibration and uncertainty quantification framework seems promising for the task of scale-bridging in the model hierarchy under investigation. Challenges for the further extension of the present work into that direction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Simulation of Sub-1-nm Gate Length Monolayer MoS2 Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-1-nm gate length $MoS_2$ transistors have been experimentally fabricated, but their device performance limit remains elusive. Herein, we explore the performance limits of the sub-1-nm gate length monolayer (ML) $MoS_2$ transistors through ab initio quantum transport simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that, through appropriate doping and dielectric engineering, the sub-1-nm devices can meet the requirement of extended 'ITRS'(International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) $L_g$=0.34 nm. Following device optimization, we achieve impressive maximum on-state current densities of 409 $\mu A / \mu m$ for n-type and 800 $\mu A / \mu m$ for p-type high-performance (HP) devices, while n-type and p-type low-power (LP) devices exhibit maximum on-state current densities of 75 $\mu A / \mu m$ and 187 $\mu A / \mu m$, respectively. We employed the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to explain the physical mechanisms of underlap and spacer region optimization on transistor performance. The underlap and spacer regions primarily influence the transport properties of sub-1-nm transistors by respectively altering the width and body factor of the potential barriers. Compared to ML $MoS_2$ transistors with a 1 nm gate length, our sub-1-nm gate length HP and LP ML $MoS_2$ transistors exhibit lower energy-delay products. Hence the sub-1-nm gate length transistors have immense potential for driving the next generation of electronics.</description>

      <title>Basis Function Dependence of Estimation Precision for Synchrotron-Radiation-Based M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is a technique employed to investigate the microscopic properties of materials using transitions between energy levels in the nuclei. Conventionally, in synchrotron-radiation-based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, the measurement window is decided by the researcher heuristically, although this decision has a significant impact on the shape of the measurement spectra. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the precision of the spectral position by introducing Bayesian estimation. The proposed method makes it possible to select the best measurement window by calculating the precision of M\"ossbauer spectroscopy from the data. Based on the results, the precision of the M\"ossbauer center shifts improved by more than three times compared with the results achieved with the conventional simple fitting method using the Lorentzian function.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it in streamflow hindcasts. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in unseen catchments) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model. Our results give further evidence that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>Meta-GGAs vs. Hybrid Functionals for Point Defects: The Best of Both Worlds Applied to Layered MnO$_2$, NiO$_2$ and KCoO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in a material can significantly tune its properties and enhance its utility. Hybrid functionals like HSE06 are often used to describe solids with defects. However, geometry optimization using hybrid functionals (e.g., HSE06), often used to describe solids with defects, is challenging for a large supercell, as needed for defect study. The proposed r$^2$SCAN+rVV10+U+U$_d$ method, which is computationally much cheaper and faster than hybrid functionals, can successfully describe defects in materials with the proper choice of U (for the d orbitals of the host atom) and U$_d$ (for those of the defect atom), as shown here for small polarons in layered transition-metal oxides. We use a literature value of U or U$_d$ appropriate to a given transition-metal ion and its oxidation state. The materials MnO$_2$ and NiO$_2$, with one K atom intercalated between layers in a supercell, are found to have one localized occupied e$_g$ state on the transition metal ion that takes an electron from the K atom, when the geometry is calculated as above, for standard U values but not for U=U$_d$=0. K-intercalated KCoO$_2$ is surprisingly different, due to a dramatic change of electronic configuration of the defected Co$^{+2}$ ion.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have the potential to enable magnetic fields beyond the current limits of low-temperature superconductors in applications like accelerator magnets. However, the design of HTS-based magnets requires computationally demanding transient multi-physics simulations with highly non-linear material properties. To reduce the solution time, we propose using Parareal (PR) for parallel-in-time magneto-thermal simulation of magnets based on HTS, particularly, no-insulation coils without turn-to-turn insulation. We propose extending the classical PR method to automatically find a time partitioning using a first coarse adaptive propagator. The proposed PR method is shown to reduce the computing time when fine engineering tolerances are required despite the highly nonlinear character of the problem. The full software stack used is open-source.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Obscured Phonon Dynamics from Powder Inelastic Neutron Scattering using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of phonon dynamics is pivotal for understanding material properties, yet it faces challenges due to the irreversible information loss inherent in powder inelastic neutron scattering spectra and the limitations of traditional analysis methods. In this study, we present a machine learning framework designed to reveal obscured phonon dynamics from powder spectra. Using a variational autoencoder, we obtain a disentangled latent representation of spectra and successfully extract force constants for reconstructing phonon dispersions. Notably, our model demonstrates effective applicability to experimental data even when trained exclusively on physics-based simulations. The fine-tuning with experimental spectra further mitigates issues arising from domain shift. Analysis of latent space underscores the model's versatility and generalizability, affirming its suitability for complex system applications. Furthermore, our framework's two-stage design is promising for developing a universal pre-trained feature extractor. This approach has the potential to revolutionize neutron measurements of phonon dynamics, offering researchers a potent tool to decipher intricate spectra and gain valuable insights into the intrinsic physics of materials.</description>

      <title>Extract Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy in a Single Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments of stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many body systems, we develop a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and corner entanglement boundaries in \textit{a single} quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different corner opening angles and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations in this field.</description>

      <title>Cooperativity, information gain, and energy cost during early LTP in dendritic spines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mutual relationship between information and energy during early phase of LTP induction and maintenance in a large-scale system of mutually coupled dendritic spines, with discrete internal states and probabilistic dynamics, within the framework of nonequilibrium stochastic thermodynamics. In order to analyze this computationally intractable stochastic multidimensional system, we introduce a pair approximation, which allows us to reduce the spine dynamics into a lower dimensional manageable system of closed equations. It is found that the rates of information gain and energy attain their maximal values during an initial period of LTP (i.e. during stimulation), and after that they recover to their baseline low values, as opposed to a memory trace that lasts much longer. This suggests that learning phase is much more energy demanding than the memory phase. We show that positive correlations between neighboring spines increase both a duration of memory trace and energy cost during LTP, but the memory time per invested energy increases dramatically for very strong positive synaptic cooperativity, suggesting a beneficial role of synaptic clustering on memory duration. In contrast, information gain after LTP is the largest for negative correlations, and energy efficiency of that information generally declines with increasing synaptic cooperativity. We also find that dendritic spines can use sparse representations for encoding of long-term information, as both energetic and structural efficiencies of retained information and its lifetime exhibit maxima for low fractions of stimulated synapses during LTP. In general, our stochastic thermodynamics approach provides a unifying framework for studying, from first principles, information encoding and its energy cost during learning and memory in stochastic systems of interacting synapses.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Viscoelastic Fluids via Energy-Based Kernel Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to measure differences in collected data is of fundamental importance for quantitative science and machine learning, motivating the establishment of metrics grounded in physical principles. In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions. Our findings underscore the importance of principled choices of metrics in both scientific and machine learning investigations of complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>MLQAOA: Graph Learning Accelerated Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multilevel QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.\\ Reproducibility: Our source code and results are available at \url{https://github.com/bachbao/MLQAOA}</description>

      <title>On convergence of waveform relaxation for nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To integrate large systems of nonlinear differential equations in time, we consider a variant of nonlinear waveform relaxation (also known as dynamic iteration or Picard-Lindel\"of iteration), where at each iteration a linear inhomogeneous system of differential equations has to be solved. This is done by the exponential block Krylov subspace (EBK) method. Thus, we have an inner-outer iterative method, where iterative approximations are determined over a certain time interval, with no time stepping involved. This approach has recently been shown to be efficient as a time-parallel integrator within the PARAEXP framework. In this paper, convergence behavior of this method is assessed theoretically and practically. We examine efficiency of the method by testing it on nonlinear Burgers, three-dimensional Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand, and three-dimensional nonlinear heat conduction equations and comparing its performance with that of conventional time-stepping integrators.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08509v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

Abstract: Dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle, and carbon capture and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reactions are still not fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we combined ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of CO$_2$ in supercritical water both in the bulk and nanoconfined states. The integration of unsupervised learning with first-principles data allows us to identify complex reaction coordinates and pathways automatically instead of a priori human speculation. Interestingly, our unbiased modelling found a novel pathway of dissolving CO$_2$(aq) under graphene nanoconfinement, involving the pyrocarbonate anion (C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) as an intermediate state. The pyrocarbonate anion was previously hypothesized to have a fleeting existence in water; however our study reveals that it is a crucial reaction intermediate and stable carbon species in the nanoconfined solutions. We even observed the formation of pyrocarbonic acid (H$_2$C$_2$O$_5$(aq)), which was unknown in water. The unexpected appearance of pyrocarbonates is related to the superionic behavior of the confined solutions. We also found that carbonation reactions involve collective proton transfer along transient water wires, which exhibits concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceeds stepwise under nanoconfinement. Our study highlights the importance of large oxocarbons in aqueous carbon reactions, with great implications for the deep carbon cycle and the sequestration of CO$_2$.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims at extending standard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to systems with sizes well below the thermodynamic limit. A rapidly evolving research field, which promises to change our understanding of the foundations of physics, while enabling the discovery of novel thermodynamic techniques and applications at the nanoscale. Thermal management has turned into a major obstacle in pushing the limits of conventional digital computers, and could likely represent a crucial issue also for quantum computers. The practical realization of quantum computers with superconducting loops requires working at cryogenic temperatures to eliminate thermal noise; ion-trap qubits need as well low temperatures to minimize collisional noise; in both cases, the sub-nanometric sizes also bring about thermal broadening of the quantum states; and even room-temperature photonic computers require cryogenic detectors. A number of thermal and thermodynamic questions therefore take center stage, such as quantum redefinitions of work and heat, thermalization and randomization of quantum states, the overlap of quantum and thermal fluctuations, and many other, even including a proper definition of temperature for the small open systems constantly out of equilibrium that are the qubits. This overview provides an introductory perspective on a selection of current trends in quantum thermodynamics and their impact on quantum computers and quantum computing, with a language accessible also to postgraduate students and researchers from different fields.</description>
