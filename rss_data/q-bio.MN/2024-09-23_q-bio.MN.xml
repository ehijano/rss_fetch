      <title>A generalizable framework for unlocking missing reactions in genome-scale metabolic networks using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete knowledge of metabolic processes hinders the accuracy of GEnome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs), which in turn impedes advancements in systems biology and metabolic engineering. Existing gap-filling methods typically rely on phenotypic data to minimize the disparity between computational predictions and experimental results. However, there is still a lack of an automatic and precise gap-filling method for initial state GEMs before experimental data and annotated genomes become available. In this study, we introduce CLOSEgaps, a deep learning-driven tool that addresses the gap-filling issue by modeling it as a hyperedge prediction problem within GEMs. Specifically, CLOSEgaps maps metabolic networks as hypergraphs and learns their hyper-topology features to identify missing reactions and gaps by leveraging hypothetical reactions. This innovative approach allows for the characterization and curation of both known and hypothetical reactions within metabolic networks. Extensive results demonstrate that CLOSEgaps accurately gap-filling over 96% of artificially introduced gaps for various GEMs. Furthermore, CLOSEgaps enhances phenotypic predictions for 24 GEMs and also finds a notable improvement in producing four crucial metabolites (Lactate, Ethanol, Propionate, and Succinate) in two organisms. As a broadly applicable solution for any GEM, CLOSEgaps represents a promising model to automate the gap-filling process and uncover missing connections between reactions and observed metabolic phenotypes.</description>

      <title>Optimal and $H_\infty$ Control of Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks is a powerful class of models for the representation a wide variety of population models including biochemistry. The control of such networks has been recently considered due to their important implications for the control of biological systems. Their optimal control, however, has been relatively few studied until now. The continuous-time finite-horizon optimal control problem is formulated first and explicitly solved in the case of unimolecular reaction networks. The problems of the optimal sampled-data control, the continuous $H_\infty$ control, and the sampled-data $H_\infty$ control of such networks are addressed next. The results in the unimolecular case take the form of nonstandard Riccati differential equations or differential Lyapunov equations coupled with difference Riccati equations, which can all be solved numerically by backward-in-time integration.</description>
