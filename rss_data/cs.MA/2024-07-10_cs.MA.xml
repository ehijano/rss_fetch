      <title>Learning Equilibrium with Estimated Payoffs in Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in population games, where agents select from multiple available strategies and continually revise their selections based on the payoffs associated with these strategies. Unlike conventional population game formulations, we consider a scenario where agents must estimate the payoffs through local measurements and communication with their neighbors. By employing task allocation games -- dynamic extensions of conventional population games -- we examine how errors in payoff estimation by individual agents affect the convergence of the strategy revision process. Our main contribution is an analysis of how estimation errors impact the convergence of the agents' strategy profile to equilibrium. Based on the analytical results, we propose a design for a time-varying strategy revision rate to guarantee convergence. Simulation studies illustrate how the proposed method for updating the revision rate facilitates convergence to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Anchor-Oriented Localized Voronoi Partitioning for GPS-denied Multi-Robot Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-robot coverage is crucial in numerous applications, including environmental monitoring, search and rescue operations, and precision agriculture. In modern applications, a multi-robot team must collaboratively explore unknown spatial fields in GPS-denied and extreme environments where global localization is unavailable. Coverage algorithms typically assume that the robot positions and the coverage environment are defined in a global reference frame. However, coordinating robot motion and ensuring coverage of the shared convex workspace without global localization is challenging. This paper proposes a novel anchor-oriented coverage (AOC) approach to generate dynamic localized Voronoi partitions based around a common anchor position. We further propose a consensus-based coordination algorithm that achieves agreement on the coverage workspace around the anchor in the robots' relative frames of reference. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed anchor-oriented approach using localized Voronoi partitioning performs as well as the state-of-the-art coverage controller using GPS.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Multi-Line Orders in Multi-Tote Storage and Retrieval Autonomous Mobile Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As warehouses are emphasizing space utilization and the ability to handle multi-line orders, multi-tote storage and retrieval (MTSR) autonomous mobile robot systems, where robots directly retrieve totes from high shelves, are becoming increasingly popular. This paper presents a novel shared-token, multi-class, semi-open queueing network model to account for multi-line orders with general distribution forms in MTSR systems. The numerical results obtained from solving the SOQN model are validated against discrete-event simulation, with most key performance metrics demonstrating high accuracy. In our experimental setting, results indicate a 12.5% reduction in the minimum number of robots needed to satisfy a specific order arrival rate using the closest retrieval sequence policy compared with the random policy. Increasing the number of tote buffer positions on a robot can greatly reduce the number of robots required in the warehouse.</description>

      <title>DebUnc: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Model Agent Communication with Uncertainty Estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents. This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates. To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels. We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase. The code is available at https://github.com/lukeyoffe/debunc</description>

      <title>Analysis of Robotic System Models Through Property Inheritance from Petri Net Meta-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the analysis of robotic system models using the Robotic System Hierarchic Petri Net (RSHPN) meta-model, proposing streamlined methods by focusing on significant system fragments and inheriting properties from the meta-model. Our research demonstrates that it is feasible to: 1) effectively analyze complex robotic systems expressed using RSHPN, and 2) enable models to inherit properties from the meta-model. This approach significantly simplifies the analysis process, reduces design time, and ensures the safety and reliability of the systems. These aspects are crucial for robots operating in human environments. Our results suggest that Petri nets could be further explored as a useful tool for the formal description and in-depth analysis of the properties of robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Fast Distributed Optimization over Directed Graphs under Malicious Attacks using Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Resilient Projected Push-Pull (RP3) algorithm designed for distributed optimization in multi-agent cyber-physical systems with directed communication graphs and the presence of malicious agents. Our algorithm leverages stochastic inter-agent trust values and gradient tracking to achieve geometric convergence rates in expectation even in adversarial environments. We introduce growing constraint sets to limit the impact of the malicious agents without compromising the geometric convergence rate of the algorithm. We prove that RP3 converges to the nominal optimal solution almost surely and in the $r$-th mean for any $r\geq 1$, provided the step sizes are sufficiently small and the constraint sets are appropriately chosen. We validate our approach with numerical studies on average consensus and multi-robot target tracking problems, demonstrating that RP3 effectively mitigates the impact of malicious agents and achieves the desired geometric convergence.</description>

      <title>Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society. The complex interactions among multiple parties/ agents involve various abilities like social reasoning, negotiation arts, and long-term strategy planning. Previous AI agents surely have proved their capability of handling multi-step games and larger action spaces on tasks involving multiple agents. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. Recently, LLM agents have shown their potential for extending the boundary of previous agents on a couple of applications, however, it is still not enough to handle a very long planning period in a complex multi-agent environment. Empowered with cutting-edge LLM technology, we make the first stab to explore AI's upper bound towards a human-like agent for such a highly comprehensive multi-agent mission by combining three core and essential capabilities for stronger LLM-based societal agents: 1) strategic planner with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiate with social reasoning; 3) augmenting memory by self-play games to self-evolving without any human in the loop.</description>

      <title>Aligning Cyber Space with Physical World: A Comprehensive Survey on Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

      <title>Solving Zebra Puzzles Using Constraint-Guided Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior research has enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve logic puzzles using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting or introducing a symbolic representation. These frameworks are still usually insufficient to solve complicated logical problems, such as Zebra puzzles, due to the inherent complexity of translating natural language clues into logical statements. We introduce a multi-agent system, ZPS, that integrates LLMs with an off the shelf theorem prover. This system tackles the complex puzzle-solving task by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, generating SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) code to solve them with a theorem prover, and using feedback between the agents to repeatedly improve their answers. We also introduce an automated grid puzzle grader to assess the correctness of our puzzle solutions and show that the automated grader is reliable by evaluating it in a user-study. Our approach shows improvement in all three LLMs we tested, with GPT-4 showing 166% improvement in the number of fully correct solutions.</description>

      <title>A Deep RL Approach on Task Placement and Scaling of Edge Resources for Cellular Vehicle-to-Network Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is currently at the forefront of the digital transformation of our society. By enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and with the traffic environment using cellular networks, we redefine transportation, improving road safety and transportation services, increasing efficiency of vehicular traffic flows, and reducing environmental impact. To effectively facilitate the provisioning of Cellular Vehicular-to-Network (C-V2N) services, we tackle the interdependent problems of service task placement and scaling of edge resources. Specifically, we formulate the joint problem and prove that it is not computationally tractable. To address its complexity we introduce a Deep Hybrid Policy Gradient (DHPG), a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for hybrid action spaces.The performance of DHPG is evaluated against several state-of-the-art (SoA) solutions through simulations employing a real-world C-V2N traffic dataset. The results demonstrate that DHPG outperforms SoA solutions in maintaining C-V2N service latency below the preset delay threshold, while simultaneously optimizing the utilization of computing resources. Finally, time complexity analysis is conducted to verify that the proposed approach can support real-time C-V2N services.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Performance of Social Machine Learning Under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the probability of error associated with the social machine learning framework, which involves an independent training phase followed by a cooperative decision-making phase over a graph. This framework addresses the problem of classifying a stream of unlabeled data in a distributed manner. In this work, we examine the classification task with limited observations during the decision-making phase, which requires a non-asymptotic performance analysis. We establish a condition for consistent training and derive an upper bound on the probability of error for classification. The results clarify the dependence on the statistical properties of the data and the combination policy used over the graph. They also establish the exponential decay of the probability of error with respect to the number of unlabeled samples.</description>
