      <title>Projective representations of almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an almost unimodular $G$, so that the Plancherel weight $\varphi_G$ on the group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ is almost periodic, we show that the basic construction for the inclusion $L(G)^{\varphi_G} \leq L(G)$ is isomorphic to a twisted group von Neumann algebra of $G \times \Delta_G(G)\hat{\ }$ with a continuous 2-cocycle, where $\Delta_G$ is the modular function. We show that when $G$ is second countable and admits a Borel 2-cocycle, $G$ is almost unimodular if and only if the central extension $\mathbb{T} \rtimes_{(1,\omega)} G$ is almost unimodular. Using this result and the connection between $\omega$-projective representations of $G$ and the representations of $\mathbb{T} \rtimes_{(1,\omega)} G$, we show that the formal degrees of irreducible and factorial square integrable projective representations behaved similarly to their representations counterparts and obtain the Atiyah--Schmid formula in the setting of second countable almost unimodular groups with a 2-cocycle twist and a finite covolume subgroup, which uses the Murray--von Neumann dimension for certain Hilbert space modules over the twisted group von Neumann algebra with its twisted Plancherel weight.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Hahn--Banach extensions and inner ideals in real C$^*$-algebras and real JB$^*$-triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every closed (resp., weak$^*$-closed) inner ideal $I$ of a real JB$^*$-triple (resp. a real JBW$^*$-triple) $E$ is Hahn--Banach smooth (resp., weak$^*$-Hahn--Banach smooth). Contrary to what is known for complex JB$^*$-triples, being (weak$^*$-)Hahn--Banach smooth does not characterise (weak$^*$-)closed inner ideals in real JB(W)$^*$-triples. We prove here that a closed (resp., weak$^*$-closed) subtriple of a real JB$^*$-triple (resp., a real JBW$^*$-triple) is Hahn-Banach smooth (resp., weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth) if, and only if, it is a hereditary subtriple. If we assume that $E$ is a reduced and atomic JBW$^*$-triple, every weak$^*$-closed subtriple of $E$ which is also weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth is an inner ideal.\smallskip
  In case that $C$ is the realification of a complex Cartan factor or a non-reduced real Cartan factor, we show that every weak$^*$-closed subtriple of $C$ which is weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth and has rank $\geq 2$ is an inner ideal. The previous conclusions are finally combined to prove the following: Let $I$ be a closed subtriple of a real JB$^*$-triple $E$ satisfying the following hypotheses:
  $(a)$ $I^*$ is separable.
  $(b)$ $I$ is weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth.
  $(c)$ The projection of $I^{**}$ onto each real or complex Cartan factor summand in the atomic part of $E^{**}$ is zero or has rank $\geq 2$.
  Then $I$ is an inner ideal of $E$.</description>

      <title>Inequality, uncertainty principles and their structural analysis for offset linear canonical transform and its quaternion extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work undertakes a twofold investigation. In the first part, we examine the inequalities and uncertainty principles in the framework of offset linear canonical transform (OLCT), with particular attention to its scaling and shifting effects. Theoretical developments are complemented by numerical simulations that substantiate and illustrate the analytical results. In the second part, we establish the connection of quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) and the OLCT by employing the orthogonal plane split (OPS) approach. Through this approach, the inequalities and uncertainty principles derived for the OLCT are extended to the QOLCT. Moreover, the computational methods designed for the OLCT may be systematically adapted to facilitate the numerical implementation of the QOLCT using this connection between OLCT and QOLCT.</description>

      <title>Weak relative Dixmier property and Popa's intertwining technique for type III subfactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \( A \subset M \) be an inclusion of von Neumann algebras equipped with a faithful normal semifinite operator valued weight \( E \colon M \to A \). We prove that every positive element \( x \in M \) with \( E(x) &lt; \infty \) satisfies the weak Dixmier property relative to \( A \): the \( \sigma \)-weak closure of the convex hull of its unitary orbit under \( \mathcal{U}(A) \) intersects the relative commutant \( A' \cap M \). This extends Marrakchi's result for the case of conditional expectations. We apply this result to obtain new structural theorems for type III factors, including a reformulation of Popa's intertwining criterion without tracial assumptions, an extension of Ozawa's relative solidity theorem to the type III setting, and a Galois-type correspondence for crossed products by totally disconnected groups. The last result resolves a question posed by Boutonnet and Brothier regarding the structure of intermediate subfactors.</description>

      <title>Structure of operator algebras for matrix orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of the differential operator algebra \( \mathcal{D}(W) \) and its associated eigenvalue algebra \( \Lambda(W) \) for matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. While \( \Lambda(W) \) is isomorphic to \( \mathcal{D}(W) \), its simpler framework allows us to efficiently derive strong results about \( \mathcal{D}(W) \) and its center \( \mathcal{Z}(W) \). We analyze the behavior of the center under Darboux transformations, establishing explicit relationships between the centers of Darboux-equivalent weights. These results are illustrated through the study of both reducible and irreducible matrix weights, including a detailed analysis of an irreducible Jacobi-type weight.</description>
