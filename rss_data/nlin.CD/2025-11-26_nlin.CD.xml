      <title>Classifying Complex Dynamical and Stochastic Systems via Physics-Based Recurrence Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the recently developed recurrence microstate probabilities as features to improve accuracy of several well-established machine learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms are applied to classify discrete and continuous dynamical systems, as well as colored noise. We demonstrate that the dynamical characteristics quantified by this method are effectively captured in the recurrence microstate space, a space defined solely by the recurrence properties of the signal. This space change reduces dimensions, which also reduces the necessary time to perform calculations and obtain relevant information about the underlying system. Here, we also demonstrate that a few optimal machine learning (ML) algorithms are particularly effective for classification when combined with recurrence microstates. Furthermore, these new machine learning vectors significantly reduce memory usage and computational complexity, outperforming the direct analysis of raw data.</description>

      <title>Topological Structure of the Cyclonic-Anticyclonic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large-scale structure and temporal evolution of cyclonic and anticyclonic systems in the North Atlantic using persistent homology applied to daily sea-level pressure anomalies from the ERA5 reanalysis (1950-2022). By interpreting the pressure field as a cubical complex and computing its sublevel- and superlevel-set filtrations, we identify degree-1 topological features corresponding respectively to anticyclones surrounded by low pressure and cyclones surrounded by high pressure. We quantify their intensity through total persistence and track their evolution over time using optimal matchings and Wasserstein distances between consecutive persistence diagrams. The method captures coherent, long-lived structures without requiring feature-tracking heuristics and reveals robust seasonal patterns: both cyclonic and anticyclonic 1-holes exhibit strong winter maxima and summer minima in total persistence, lifetime, and frequency. Cyclonic features are more persistent, more numerous, and longer-lived than their anticyclonic counterparts, consistent with the climatological dominance of the Icelandic Low in winter and the weaker, more transient nature of anticyclonic highs. Long trajectories correspond to known large-scale structures such as winter cyclonic deepening and blocking episodes. These results demonstrate that persistent homology provides an objective, filtering-free characterization of pressure-field organization and offers a topological framework to analyze the dynamics and variability of mid-latitude circulation.</description>

      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is characterized by poorly understood complex multiannual cycles. The origins of these cycles have long been debated, and multiple explanations of varying complexity have been suggested. Using Bayesian methods, we fit a dynamical model to half a century of M. pneumoniae surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025) and uncover a parsimonious explanation for the persistent cycles, based on the theory of quasicycles. The period of the multiannual cycle (approx. 5 years in Denmark) is explained by susceptible replenishment due, primarily, to loss of immunity. While an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, unable to reproduce the persistent cycles. We find that environmental stochasticity (e.g., varying contact rates) stabilizes the multiannual cycles and so does demographic noise, at least in smaller or incompletely mixing populations. The temporary disappearance of cycles during 1979-1985 is explained as a consequence of stochastic mode-hopping. The circulation of M. pneumoniae was recently disrupted by COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), providing a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations for long-term prediction. More generally, our findings provide further evidence for the role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>

      <title>Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.</description>
