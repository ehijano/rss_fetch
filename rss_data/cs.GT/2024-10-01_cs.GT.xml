      <title>Mechanism Design with Delegated Bidding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a designer who wants to allocate resources to representatives, that then distribute the resources they receive among the individuals they represent. Motivated by the way Feeding America, one of the largest U.S. charities, allocates donations to food banks, which then further distribute the donations to food-insecure individuals, we focus on mechanisms that use artificial currencies. We compare auctions through the lens of the Price of Anarchy, with respect to three canonical welfare objectives: utilitarian social welfare (sum of individuals' utilities), Nash social welfare (product of individuals' utilities), and egalitarian social welfare (minimum of individuals' utilities). We prove strong lower bounds on the Price of Anarchy of all auctions that allocate each item to the highest bidder, subject to a mild technical constraint; this includes Feeding America's current auction, the First-Price auction. In sharp contrast, our main result shows that adapting the classic Trading Post mechanism of Shapley and Shubik to this setting, and coupled with Feeding America's choice of budget rule (each representative gets an amount of artificial currency equal to the number of individuals it represents), achieves a small Price of Anarchy for all generalized $p$-mean objectives simultaneously. Our bound on the Price of Anarchy of the Trading Post mechanism depends on $\ell$: the product of the rank and the ``incoherence'' of the underlying valuation matrix, which together capture a notion of how ``spread out'' the values of a matrix are. This notion has been extremely influential in the matrix completion literature, and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been used in auction theory prior to our work. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that the dependence on $\ell$ is necessary: the Price of Anarchy of the Trading Post mechanism is $\Omega(\sqrt{\ell})$.</description>

      <title>Optimal RANDAO Manipulation in Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that RANDAO manipulation is possible in Ethereum if an adversary controls the proposers assigned to the last slots in an epoch. We provide a methodology to compute, for any fraction $\alpha$ of stake owned by an adversary, the maximum fraction $f(\alpha)$ of rounds that a strategic adversary can propose. We further implement our methodology and compute $f(\cdot)$ for all $\alpha$. For example, we conclude that an optimal strategic participant with $5\%$ of the stake can propose a $5.048\%$ fraction of rounds, $10\%$ of the stake can propose a $10.19\%$ fraction of rounds, and $20\%$ of the stake can propose a $20.68\%$ fraction of rounds.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Competitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider facility location games with competitors where the agents are divided into groups and the agents in the same group have competitive relationships, i.e., the cost of an agent will increase if the facility is closer to their competitors. We consider three types of misreporting: misreporting the location only, misreporting the group membership only, and misreporting both. To minimize the social cost, we propose a strategyproof mechanism that is optimal when misreporting the location only. For the other two types of manipulation, we reuse the median mechanism and achieve tight bounds of 2. To minimize the maximum cost, we design new strategyproof mechanisms for the first two types of misreporting. We reuse the leftmost mechanism for misreporting both. All bounds are almost tight.</description>

      <title>Impartial Selection Under Combinatorial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impartial selection problems are concerned with the selection of one or more agents from a set based on mutual nominations from within the set. To avoid strategic nominations of the agents, the axiom of impartiality requires that the selection of each agent is independent of the nominations cast by that agent. This paper initiates the study of impartial selection problems where the nominations are weighted and the set of agents that can be selected is restricted by a combinatorial constraint. We call a selection mechanism $\alpha$-optimal if, for every instance, the ratio between the total sum of weighted nominations of the selected set and that of the best feasible set of agents is at least $\alpha$. We show that a natural extension of a mechanism studied for the selection of a single agent remains impartial and $\frac{1}{4}$-optimal for general independence systems, and we generalize upper bounds from the selection of multiple agents by parameterizing them by the girth of the independence system. We then focus on independence systems defined by knapsack and matroid constraints, giving impartial mechanisms that exploit a greedy order of the agents and achieve approximation ratios of $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, respectively, when agents cast a single nomination. For graphic matroids, we further devise an impartial and $\frac{1}{3}$-optimal mechanism for an arbitrary number of unweighted nominations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing based Near-Optimal Resource Allocation for Elastic Edge Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mobile edge computing (MEC), task offloading can significantly reduce task execution latency and energy consumption of end user (EU). However, edge server (ES) resources are limited, necessitating efficient allocation to ensure the sustainable and healthy development for MEC systems. In this paper, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism based near-optimal resource allocation for elastic edge offloading. First, we construct a resource pricing model and accordingly develop the utility functions for both EU and ES, the optimal pricing model parameters are derived by optimizing the utility functions. In the meantime, our theoretical analysis reveals that the EU's utility function reaches a local maximum within the search range, but exhibits barely growth with increased resource allocation beyond this point. To this end, we further propose the Dynamic Inertia and Speed-Constrained particle swarm optimization (DISC-PSO) algorithm, which efficiently identifies the near-optimal resource allocation. Comprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of DISC-PSO, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing schemes by reducing the average number of iterations to reach a near-optimal solution by 92.11\%, increasing the final user utility function value by 0.24\%, and decreasing the variance of results by 95.45\%.</description>

      <title>Fairness Analysis with Shapley-Owen Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that relative importance and its equitable attribution in terms of Shapley-Owen effects is an appropriate one, and, if we accept a small number of reasonable imperatives for equitable attribution, the only way to measure fairness. On the other hand, the computation of Shapley-Owen effects can be very demanding. Our main technical result is a spectral decomposition of the Shapley-Owen effects, which decomposes the computation of these indices into a model-specific and a model-independent part. The model-independent part is precomputed once and for all, and the model-specific computation of Shapley-Owen effects is expressed analytically in terms of the coefficients of the model's \emph{polynomial chaos expansion} (PCE), which can now be reused to compute different Shapley-Owen effects. We also propose an algorithm for computing precise and sparse truncations of the PCE of the model and the spectral decomposition of the Shapley-Owen effects, together with upper bounds on the accumulated approximation errors. The approximations of both the PCE and the Shapley-Owen effects converge to their true values.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Model for Multidimensional Intransitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intransitivity is a critical issue in pairwise preference modeling. It refers to the intransitive pairwise preferences between a group of players or objects that potentially form a cyclic preference chain and has been long discussed in social choice theory in the context of the dominance relationship. However, such multifaceted intransitivity between players and the corresponding player representations in high dimensions is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that jointly learns each player's d-dimensional representation (d&gt;1) and a dataset-specific metric space that systematically captures the distance metric in Rd over the embedding space. Interestingly, by imposing additional constraints in the metric space, our proposed model degenerates to former models used in intransitive representation learning. Moreover, we present an extensive quantitative investigation of the vast existence of intransitive relationships between objects in various real-world benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first of this type. The predictive performance of our proposed method on different real-world datasets, including social choice, election, and online game datasets, shows that our proposed method outperforms several competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hedging and Approximate Truthfulness in Traditional Forecasting Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In forecasting competitions, the traditional mechanism scores the predictions of each contestant against the outcome of each event, and the contestant with the highest total score wins. While it is well-known that this traditional mechanism can suffer from incentive issues, it is folklore that contestants will still be roughly truthful as the number of events grows. Yet thus far the literature lacks a formal analysis of this traditional mechanism. This paper gives the first such analysis. We first demonstrate that the ''long-run truthfulness'' folklore is false: even for arbitrary numbers of events, the best forecaster can have an incentive to hedge, reporting more moderate beliefs to increase their win probability. On the positive side, however, we show that two contestants will be approximately truthful when they have sufficient uncertainty over the relative quality of their opponent and the outcomes of the events, a case which may arise in practice.</description>

      <title>Can We Break the Curse of Multiagency in Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. Solving RMGs remains under-explored, from problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. A notorious yet open challenge is if RMGs can escape the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs where the uncertainty set of each agent is shaped by both the environment and other agents' strategies in a best-response manner. We first establish the well-posedness of these RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs.</description>

      <title>The Secretary Problem with Predicted Additive Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The secretary problem is one of the fundamental problems in online decision making; a tight competitive ratio for this problem of $1/\mathrm{e} \approx 0.368$ has been known since the 1960s. Much more recently, the study of algorithms with predictions was introduced: The algorithm is equipped with a (possibly erroneous) additional piece of information upfront which can be used to improve the algorithm's performance. Complementing previous work on secretary problems with prior knowledge, we tackle the following question:
  What is the weakest piece of information that allows us to break the $1/\mathrm{e}$ barrier?
  To this end, we introduce the secretary problem with predicted additive gap. As in the classical problem, weights are fixed by an adversary and elements appear in random order. In contrast to previous variants of predictions, our algorithm only has access to a much weaker piece of information: an \emph{additive gap} $c$. This gap is the difference between the highest and $k$-th highest weight in the sequence. Unlike previous pieces of advice, knowing an exact additive gap does not make the problem trivial. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that for any index $k$ and any gap $c$, we can obtain a competitive ratio of $0.4$ when knowing the exact gap (even if we do not know $k$), hence beating the prevalent bound for the classical problem by a constant. Second, a slightly modified version of our algorithm allows to prove standard robustness-consistency properties as well as improved guarantees when knowing a range for the error of the prediction.</description>

      <title>Active Inverse Learning in Stackelberg Trajectory Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game-theoretic inverse learning is the problem of inferring a player's objectives from their actions. We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</description>

      <title>Geometric Structure and Polynomial-time Algorithm of Game Equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00747v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) exists for game equilibria has been an open question, and its absence has indications and consequences in three fields: the practicality of methods in algorithmic game theory, non-stationarity and curse of multiagency in MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning), and the tractability of PPAD in computational complexity theory. In this paper, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, regarding which, first, we formalize perfect equilibria of dynamic games as the zero points of its canonical section, second, we formalize a hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method as a line search on it, third, we give the existence and oddness theorems of it as an extension of those of Nash equilibria. The line search leads to any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, it achieves a weak approximation (approximating to an $\epsilon$-equilibrium) in fully polynomial time, and it achieves a strong approximation (approximating to an $\epsilon$-neighborhood of an actual equilibrium) with dependent time complexity. Our method is an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for the PPAD-complete weak approximation problem of game equilibria, implying PPAD=FP. As intermediate results, we introduce two concepts called unbiased barrier problem and unbiased KKT conditions to make the interior point method to approximate Nash equilibria, and introduce a concept called policy cone to give the sufficient and necessary condition for dynamic programming to converge to perfect equilibria. In experiment, the line search process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated dynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.</description>

      <title>Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect. In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market). This paper gives a definition of plausible algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms. The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect. Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to contain the data sufficient to pass the audit. Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., supra-competitive prices cannot pass the audit. The definition allows sellers to possess useful side information that may be correlated with supply and demand and could affect the prices used by good algorithms. The paper provides an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Price Bounds Estimation with Shape Constraints in Price Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the interpretable estimation of price bounds in the context of price optimization. In recent years, price-optimization methods have become indispensable for maximizing revenue and profits. However, effective application of these methods to real-world pricing operations remains a significant challenge. It is crucial for operators responsible for setting prices to utilize reasonable price bounds that are not only interpretable but also acceptable. Despite this necessity, most studies assume that price bounds are given constant values, and few have explored reasonable determinations of these bounds. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework for determining price bounds that includes both the estimation and adjustment of these bounds. Specifically, we first estimate price bounds using three distinct approaches based on historical pricing data. Then, we adjust the estimated price bounds by solving an optimization problem that incorporates shape constraints. This method allows the implementation of price optimization under practical and reasonable price bounds suitable for real-world applications. We report the effectiveness of our proposed method through numerical experiments using historical pricing data from actual services.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Coordination Induced in an Adversarial Graph-Traversal Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a game theoretic formulation of a graph traversal problem, with applications to robots moving through hazardous environments in the presence of an adversary, as in military and security scenarios. The blue team of robots moves in an environment modeled by a time-varying graph, attempting to reach some goal with minimum cost, while the red team controls how the graph changes to maximize the cost. The problem is formulated as a stochastic game, so that Nash equilibrium strategies can be computed numerically. Bounds are provided for the game value, with a guarantee that it solves the original problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate the results and the effectiveness of this method, particularly showing the benefit of mixing actions for both players, as well as beneficial coordinated behavior, where blue robots split up and/or synchronize to traverse risky edges.</description>

      <title>Non-cooperative rational synthesis problem for probabilistic strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decidability and complexity of non-cooperative rational synthesis problem (abbreviated as NCRSP) for some classes of probabilistic strategies. We show that NCRSP for stationary strategies and Muller objectives is in 3-EXPTIME, and if we restrict the strategies of environment players to be positional, NCRSP becomes NEXPSPACE solvable. On the other hand, NCRSP_&gt;, which is a variant of NCRSP, is shown to be undecidable even for pure finite-state strategies and terminal reachability objectives. Finally, we show that NCRSP becomes EXPTIME solvable if we restrict the memory of a strategy to be the most recently visited t vertices where t is linear in the size of the game.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Charitable Donations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charity is typically carried out by individual donors, who donate money to charities they support, or by centralized organizations such as governments or municipalities, which collect individual contributions and distribute them among a set of charities. Individual charity respects the will of the donors, but may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination; centralized charity is potentially more efficient, but may ignore the will of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods for donors with Leontief preferences (i.e., each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities). The mechanism distributes the contribution of each donor efficiently such that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, can be computed efficiently, and implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.</description>
