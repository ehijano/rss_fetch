      <title>The Joint Solvation Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solvent-induced interactions (SII) between flexible solutes can be separated into two distinct components: the solvation-induced conformational effect, and the joint solvation interaction (JSI). The JSI quantifies the thermodynamic effect of the solvent simultaneously accommodating the solutes, generalizing the typical notion of the hydrophobic interaction. We present a formal definition of the JSI within the framework of the mixture expansion, demonstrate that this definition is equivalent to the SII between rigid solutes, and propose a method, partially-connected molecular dynamics, which allows one to compute the interaction with existing free energy algorithms. We also compare the JSI to the more natural generalization of the hydrophobic interaction, the indirect solvent-mediated interaction, and argue that JSI is a more useful quantity for studying solute binding thermodynamics. Direct calculation of the JSI may prove useful in developing our understanding of solvent effects in self-assembly, protein aggregation, and protein folding, for which the isolation of the JSI from the conformational component of the SII becomes important due to the intra-species flexibility.</description>

      <title>Meta-creatures: Developing an omnipotent hydrogel cell to construct bio-inspired systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to current technological challenges, including the complexity of precise control, low long-term survival and success rates, difficulty in maintaining function over extended periods, and high energy consumption, the construction of life-like creatures with multilevel structures and varied physiological characteristics is a goal that has yet to be achieved1-3. Here, to create a parallel entity termed a meta-creature with similar functions and characteristics to those of natural organisms, we introduce a process for the transformation of an omnipotent hydrogel cell (OHC), which is inspired by totipotent stem cells and carries bio-inspired bioelectricity, into a meta-creature. We captured the electrical signals transmitted between the meta-nerve fibres and rat sciatic nerves, the physicochemical signals perceived by the meta-mouth, and the information exchanged between the meta-skin and the external environment. Notably, the meta-cardiovascular system, which is capable of exchanging matter and energy with external environments, exhibited similar electrocardiogram signals during testing in rabbits; these results indicated feedback with a biological system and the potential for ex vivo bioelectric remodelling. Finally, a meta-creature was designed and exhibited bio-inspired bioelectricity signals during the simulated outdoor flight. This work reveals new possibilities for constructing bio-inspired systems, thereby improving our understanding of bioelectricity and biomimicry.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>
