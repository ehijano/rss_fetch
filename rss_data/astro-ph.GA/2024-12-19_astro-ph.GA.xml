      <title>Cosmology with Supernova Encore in the lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 -- Spectroscopy with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 &lt; z &lt; 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.</description>

      <title>PANORAMIC: Discovery of an Ultra-Massive Grand-Design Spiral Galaxy at $z\sim5.2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an ultra-massive grand-design red spiral galaxy, named Zh\'ul\'ong (Torch Dragon), at $z_{\rm phot} = 5.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the JWST PANORAMIC survey, identified as the most distant bulge+disk galaxy with spiral arms known to date. Zh\'ul\'ong displays an extraordinary combination of properties: 1) a classical bulge centered in a large, face-on exponential stellar disk (half-light radius of $R_{\rm e} = 3.7 \pm 0.1 \, \mathrm{kpc}$), with spiral arms extending across 19 kpc; 2) a clear transition from the red, quiescent core ($F150W-F444W=3.1$ mag) with high stellar mass surface density ($\log(\Sigma M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{kpc}^{-2}) = 9.91_{-0.09}^{+0.11}$) to the star-forming outer regions, as revealed by spatially resolved SED analysis, which indicates significant inside-out galaxy growth; 3) an extremely high stellar mass at its redshift, with $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=11.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ comparable to the Milky Way, and an implied baryon-to-star conversion efficiency ($\epsilon \sim 0.3$) that is 1.5 times higher than even the most efficient galaxies at later epochs; 4) despite an active disk, a relatively modest overall star formation rate ($\mathrm{SFR} =66_{-46}^{+89} ~M_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), which is $&gt;$0.5 dex below the star formation main sequence at $z \sim 5.2$ and $&gt;$10 times lower than ultra-massive dusty galaxies at $z=5-6$. Altogether, Zh\'ul\'ong shows that mature galaxies emerged much earlier than expected in the first billion years after the Big Bang through rapid galaxy formation and morphological evolution. Our finding offers key constraints for models of massive galaxy formation and the origin of spiral structures in the early universe.</description>

      <title>On the maximum disk heating attributable to fuzzy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) granulations would drive orbital transport of stars in galactic disks, and in particular would produce roughly equal amounts of radial heating and radial migration. However, observations suggest that heating has been much less efficient than migration in our Galaxy. We argue that this decreases the amount of radial heating, $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{FDM}$, that can safely be attributed to FDM. Consequently, lower bounds on the FDM particle mass $m$ derived through Galactic disk kinematics should be revised upwards; a rough estimate is $m \gtrsim 1.3\times 10^{-22} \mathrm{eV} \times [(\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{FDM}/\mathcal{H})/0.1]^{-1/2}$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the total observed radial heating.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the formation channels of stellar halos through their chemical fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar halos around galaxies contain key information about their formation and assembly history. Using simulations, we can trace the origins of different stellar populations in these halos, contributing to our understanding of galaxy evolution. We aim to investigate the assembly of stellar halos and their chemical abundances in 28 galaxies from CIELO project with logMgal[9 and 11]Msun. Stellar halos were identified using the AM E method, focusing on the outer regions between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We divided the stellar populations based on their formation channel: exsitu, endodebris, and insitu, and analyzed their chemical abundances, ages, and spatial distributions. Additionally, we explored correlations between halo mass, metallicity, and alpha element enrichment. CIELO simulations reveal that stellar halos are predominantly composed of accreted material (exsitu and endodebris stars), in agreement with previous works. The mass fraction of these populations is independent of stellar halo mass, though their metallicities scale linearly with it. Exsitu stars tend to dominate the outskirts and be more alpha rich and older, while endodebris stars are more prevalent at lower radii and tend to be less alpha rich and slightly younger. Massive stellar halos require a median of five additional satellites to build 90 percent of their mass, compared to lower mass halos, which typically need fewer (median of 2.5) and lower-mass satellites and are assembled earlier. The diversity of accreted satellite histories results in well defined stellar halo mass metallicity and [alpha/Fe] [Fe/H] relations, offering a detailed view of the chemical evolution and assembly history of stellar halos. We find that the [alpha/Fe] [Fe/H] is more sensitive to the characteristics and star formation history of the contributing satellites than the stellar halo mass metallicity relationship</description>

      <title>Extragalactic globular cluster near-infrared spectroscopy: I. Integrated near-infrared spectra of Centaurus A/NGC 5128</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to constrain the evolutionary histories of galaxies is to analyse their stellar populations. In the local Universe, our understanding of the stellar population properties of galaxies has traditionally relied on the study of optical absorption and emission-line features. In order to overcome limitations intrinsic to this wavelength range, such as the age-metallicity degeneracy and the high sensitivity to dust reddening, we must use wavelength ranges beyond the optical. The near-infrared (NIR) offers a possibility to extract information on spectral signatures that are not as obvious in traditional optical bands. Moreover, with the current and forthcoming generation of instrumentation focusing on the NIR, it is mandatory to explore possibilities within this wavelength range for nearby-Universe galaxies. However, although the NIR shows great potential, we are only beginning to understand it. Widely used techniques such as a full spectral fitting and line strength indices need to be tested on systems that are as close to simple stellar populations as possible, and the result from the techniques need to be compared to the yields from a traditional optical analysis. We present a NIR spectral survey of extragalactic globular clusters (GCs). The set was composed of 21 GCs from NGC5128 that were obtained with SOAR/TripleSpec4, which covered the ~1.0-2.4$\mu$m range with a spectral resolution R=$\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ of 3500. These spectra cover H$\beta$ equivalent widths between 0.98$\r{A}$ and 4.32$\r{A}$, and [MgFe]' between 0.24$\r{A}$ and 3.76$\r{A}$. This set is ideal for performing absorption band measurements and a full spectral fitting, and it can be used for kinematic studies and age and abundance measurements. With this library, we expect to be able to probe the capabilities of NIR models, as well as to further improve stellar population estimates for the GCs around NGC5128.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic globular cluster near-infrared spectroscopy: II. The stellar population synthesis model zero-point problem extends to the near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent studies have pointed out significant discrepancies between observations and models of stellar populations in the near-infrared (NIR). With current and future observing facilities being focused in this wavelength range, properly assessing and solving these issues is of utmost importance. Here, we present the first application of the extragalactic globular cluster (GC) near-infrared spectroscopy survey, and present evidence that these GCs reveal an age zero-point problem of stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. This problem has already been identified in the optical range for the GCs of the Milky Way. Such an issue arises when derived GC spectroscopic ages appear older than the Universe itself. We extend this discussion for the first time to the NIR, specifically using the Pa$_{\rm\beta}$ line at 1.28~microns. We focus on the GCs of the nearby Centaurus~A galaxy using their NIR spectra. This work broadens our understanding of the age zero-point problem and emphasises the necessity to revisit and refine SPS models, especially in the NIR domain.</description>

      <title>Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: IRAS16293E (Oph464)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-stellar cores are the first steps in the process of star and planet formation. However, the dynamical and chemical evolution of pre-stellar cores is still not well understood. We aim at estimating the central density of the pre-stellar core IRAS16293E and at carrying out an inventory of molecular species towards the density peak of the core. We observed high-$J$ rotational transitions of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, and several other molecular lines towards the dust emission peak using the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope, and derived the density and temperature profiles of the core using far-infrared surface brightness maps from $Herschel$. The N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines were analysed by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Our best-fit core model consists in a static inner region, embedded in an infalling envelope with an inner radius of approximately 3000 au (21" at 141 pc). The observed high-J lines of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ (with critical densities greater than 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) turn out to be very sensitive to depletion; the present single-dish observations are best explained with no depletion of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ in the inner core. The N$_2$D$^+$/N$_2$H$^+$ ratio that best reproduces our observations is 0.44, one of the largest observed to date in pre-stellar cores. Additionally, half of the molecules that we observed are deuterated isotopologues, confirming the high-level of deuteration towards this source. Non-LTE radiative transfer modelling of N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ lines proved to be an excellent diagnostic of the chemical structure and dynamics of a pre-stellar core. Probing the physical conditions immediately before the protostellar collapse is a necessary reference for theoretical studies and simulations with the aim of understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation and the time scale of this process.</description>

      <title>The role of accreted and in-situ populations in shaping the stellar haloes of low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar haloes of dwarf galaxies are becoming an object of interest in the extragalactic community due to their detection in some recent observations. Additionally, new cosmological simulations of very high resolution were performed, allowing their study. These stellar haloes could help shed light on our understanding of the assembly of dwarf galaxies and their evolution, and allow us to test the hierarchical model for the formation of structures at small scales. We aim to characterise the stellar haloes of simulated dwarf galaxies and analyse their evolution and accretion history. We use a sample of 17 simulated galaxies from the Auriga Project with a stellar mass range from 3.28x10^8 Msun to 2.08x10^10 Msun. We define the stellar halo as the stellar material located outside an ellipsoid with semi-major axes equal to 4 times the half light radius (Rh) of each galaxy. We find that the inner regions of the stellar halo (4 to 6 times the Rh) are dominated by in-situ material. For the less massive simulated dwarfs (M*&lt;=4.54x10^8 Msun), this dominance extends to all radii. We find that this in-situ stellar halo is mostly formed in the inner regions of the galaxies and then ejected into the outskirts during interactions and merger events. In ~50% of the galaxies, the stripped gas from satellites contributed to the formation of this in-situ halo. The stellar haloes of the galaxies more massive than M*&gt;=1x10^9 Msun are dominated by the accreted component beyond 6 Rh. We find that the more massive dwarf galaxies accrete stellar material until later times (t90~4.44 Gyr ago, being t90 the formation time) than the less massive ones (t90~8.17 Gyr ago), impacting on the formation time of the accreted stellar haloes. The galaxies have a range of 1 to 7 significant progenitors contributing to their accreted component but there is no correlation between this quantity and the galaxies' accreted mass.</description>

      <title>Isolated Binary Black Hole Formation and Merger Rates from Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has detected 90 gravitational wave events and will detect many more in its fourth observing run. Binary black hole (BBH) systems represent the overwhelming majority of these observations. We build a model for the population of the BBHs based on the observed distribution of metallicities in galaxies and state-of-the-art stellar evolution models implemented through the Stellar EVolution N-body (SEVN) code. We calculate the primary mass spectrum and merger rates of BBHs and find general agreement with the redshift evolution and mass ratio distribution inferred by the LVK collaboration. When comparing to the primary mass distribution, our results indicate that either the average IMF in dwarf galaxies must be top heavy, or most of the $30-40 \, M_\odot$ black holes must be formed through a dynamical capture mechanism. For masses greater than about $50 \, M_\odot$, the predicted number of BBH systems plummet to zero, revealing the well-known mass gap due to the pair instability mechanism and the mass loss in binary systems. We estimate the probability needed to fill part of the mass gap with mergers of dynamically-formed BBHs originating from the single black hole population.</description>

      <title>Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Open Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and properties of open superclusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Utilizing Gaia-derived advanced astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze the member stars of various open clusters (OCs), deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered OC Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that single-star evolutionary models are inadequate to reproduce all observational properties of massive stars. Binary interaction has emerged as a key factor in the evolution of a significant fraction of massive stars. In this study, we investigate the helium ($Y_{\mathrm He}$) and nitrogen ($\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$) surface abundances in a comprehensive sample of 180 Galactic O-type stars with projected rotational velocities $v\sin(i)\leq150{\mathrm km}\cdot{\mathrm s}^{-1}$. We found a subsample ($\sim20\%$ of the total, and $\sim80\%$ of the stars with $Y_{\mathrm He}\geq0.12$) with a $Y_{\mathrm He}$ and $\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$ combined pattern unexplainable by single-star evolution. We argue that the stars with anomalous surface abundance patterns are binary interaction products.</description>

      <title>Dark matter halos of luminous AGNs from galaxy-galaxy lensing with the HSC Subaru Strategic Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the dark matter halo masses of luminous AGNs over the redshift range 0.2 to 1.2 using galaxy-galaxy lensing based on imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We measure the weak lensing signal of a sample of 48907 AGNs constructed using HSC and WISE photometry. %The lensing detection around AGNs has a signal to noise ratio of \textbf{29}. As expected, we find that the lensing mass profile of total AGN sample is consistent with that of massive galaxies ($\rm log(M_{*}/h^{-2}M_\odot)\sim$ 10.61). Surprisingly, the lensing signal remains unchanged when the AGN sample is split into four stellar mass bins of host galaxies. Specifically, we find that the excess surface density (ESD) of AGNs, residing in galaxies with high stellar masses, significantly differs from that of the control sample. We further fit a halo occupation distribution model to the data to infer the posterior distribution of parameters including the average halo mass. We find that the characteristic halo mass of the full AGN population lies near the knee ($\rm log(M_h/h^{-1}M_{\odot})=12.0$) of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Illustrative of the results given above, the halo masses of AGNs residing in host galaxies with high stellar masses (i.e., above the knee of the SHMR) falls below the calibrated SHMR while the halo mass of the low stellar mass sample is more consistent with the established SHMR. These results indicate that massive halos with higher clustering bias tends to suppress AGN activity, probably due to the lack of available gas.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to the halo galaxy - supermassive black hole connection through cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the co-evolution of dark matter halos, galaxies and supermassive black holes using an empirical galaxy evolution model from $z=0$ -- $10$. We demonstrate that by connecting dark matter structure evolution with simple empirical prescriptions for baryonic processes, we are able to faithfully reproduce key observations in the relation between galaxies and their supermassive black holes. By assuming a physically-motivated, direct relationship between the galaxy and supermassive black hole properties to the mass of their host halo, we construct expressions for the galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy UV luminosity function, active black hole mass function and quasar bolometric luminosity function. We calibrate the baryonic prescriptions using a fully Bayesian approach in order to reproduce observed population statistics. The obtained parametrizations are then used to study the relation between galaxy and black hole properties, as well as their evolution with redshift. The galaxy stellar mass -- UV luminosity relation, black hole mass -- stellar mass relation, black hole mass -- AGN luminosity relation, and redshift evolution of these quantities obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with observations. Based on these results, we present upper limits on the expected number of sources for $z=5$ up to $z=15$ for scheduled JWST and \textit{Euclid} surveys, thus showcasing that empirical models can offer qualitative as well as quantitative prediction in a fast, easy and flexible manner that complements more computationally expensive approaches.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of circumnuclear ionising clusters. II. NGC 7469</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circumnuclear star forming regions (CNSFR) are massive clusters found close to galactic nuclei. These entities give us an excellent opportunity to study star formation in environments with high metallicity and to relate it with active galactic nuclei. Our principal aim is to derive the physical properties and dynamical masses of the CNSFRs in the two rings of the spiral NGC 7469, categorized as a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) and hosting a Seyfert 1 nucleus. We have used archival data obtained with the MUSE spectrograph attached to one of the ESO VLT telescopes and we have applied the techniques shown in the first paper of the series. Regions in the studied galaxy show large sizes which can be explained by the stellar winds produced by WR stars. The inner ring regions seem to be more compact than the outer ones, showing higher electron densities and filling factors. The young stellar population of the clusters has contributions of ionising populations with ages around 5 Ma and its masses constitute less than a 1\% of the total mass of each cluster. The inner ring regions which are close to the active galactic nucleus probably are the only ones that have enough mass to survive the action of the AGN. They constitute the $\sim$ 90 \% of the total inner ring mass.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>KAgoshima Galactic Object survey with Nobeyama 45-metre telescope by Mapping in Ammonia lines (KAGONMA): Discovery of parsec-scale CO depletion in the Canis Major star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In observational studies of infrared dark clouds, the number of detections of CO freeze-out onto dust grains (CO depletion) at pc-scale is extremely limited, and the conditions for its occurrence are, therefore, still unknown. We report a new object where pc-scale CO depletion is expected. As a part of Kagoshima Galactic Object survey with Nobeyama 45-m telescope by Mapping in Ammonia lines (KAGONMA), we have made mapping observations of NH3 inversion transition lines towards the star-forming region associated with the CMa OB1 including IRAS 07077-1026, IRAS 07081-1028, and PGCC G224.28-0.82. By comparing the spatial distributions of the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0), an intensity anti-correlation was found in IRAS 07077-1026 and IRAS 07081-1028 on the ~1 pc scale. Furthermore, we obtained a lower abundance of C18O at least in IRAS 07077-1026 than in the other parts of the star-forming region. After examining high density gas dissipation, photodissociation, and CO depletion, we concluded that the intensity anti-correlation in IRAS 07077-1026 is due to CO depletion. On the other hand, in the vicinity of the centre of PGCC G224.28-0.82, the emission line intensities of both the NH3 (1,1) and C18O (J=1-0) were strongly detected, although the gas temperature and density were similar to IRAS 07077-1026. This indicates that there are situations where C18O (J=1-0) cannot trace dense gas on the pc scale and implies that the conditional differences that C18O (J=1-0) can and cannot trace dense gas are unclear.</description>

      <title>Partial alignment between jets and megamasers: Coherent versus selective accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution, and occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs). To date, observational estimates of MBH spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have recently been questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for MBH spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on MBH spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and megamaser disks in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and megamaser that can be attributed to two different causes: coherent accretion and selective accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios regarding the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and checking whether either applies to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this third paper of a series, we study the kinematics of the ionised gas and stars, calculating the dynamical masses of the circumnuclear star-forming regions in the ring of of the face-on spiral NGC 7742. We have used high spectral resolution data from the MEGARA instrument attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) to measure the kinematical components of the nebular emission lines of selected HII regions and the stellar velocity dispersions from the CaT absorption lines that allow the derivation of the associated cluster virialized masses. The emission line profiles show two different kinematical components: a narrow one with velocity dispersion $\sim$ 10 km/s and a broad one with velocity dispersion similar to those found for the stellar absorption lines. The derived star cluster dynamical masses range from 2.5 $\times$ 10$^6$ to 10.0 $\times$ 10$^7$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of gas and stellar velocity dispersions suggests a scenario where the clusters have formed simultaneously in a first star formation episode with a fraction of the stellar evolution feedback remaining trapped in the cluster, subject to the same gravitational potential as the cluster stars. Between 0.15 and 7.07 % of the total dynamical mass of the cluster would have cooled down and formed a new, younger, population of stars, responsible for the ionisation of the gas currently observed.</description>

      <title>On the dark matter content of ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I compare the dark matter content within stellar half-mass radius expected in a $\Lambda$CDM-based galaxy formation model with existing observational estimates for the observed dwarf satellites of the Milky Way and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). The model reproduces the main properties and scaling relations of dwarf galaxies, in particular their stellar mass-size relation. I show that the model also reproduces the relation between the dark matter mass within the half-mass radius, $M_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{1/2})$, and stellar mass exhibited by the observed dwarf galaxies. The scatter in the $M_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{1/2})-M_\star$ relation is driven primarily by the broad range of sizes of galaxies of a given stellar mass. I also show the $M_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{1/2})$ of UDGs are within the range expected in the model for their stellar mass, but they tend to lie above the median relation due to their large sizes. The upper limits on $M_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{1/2})$ for the dark matter deficient UDGs are also consistent with the range of dark matter masses expected in the model. The most dark matter-deficient galaxies of a given size correspond to halos with the smallest concentrations and the largest ratios of $M_\star/M_{\rm 200c}$. Conversely, the most dark matter-dominated galaxies are hosted by the highest concentration halos with the smallest $M_\star/M_{\rm 200c}$ ratios. Results presented in this paper indicate that dark matter content of observed UDGs may represent a tail of the expected dark matter profiles, especially if the effect of feedback on these profiles is taken into account. Nevertheless, the unusually rich GC populations in some UDG galaxies do indicate unusual evolution. Our results simply indicate that with the current accuracy of the velocity dispersion measurements their $M_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{1/2})$ are consistent with the range expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy in the 1-24 GHz parsec-scale radio spectra of radio-quiet quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the pc-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar-Green radio-quiet quasars, based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5-5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source on a scale smaller than the broad-line region (BLR) radius R_BLR ~ 0.01-0.1 pc. The 8.4-23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source R_in &lt; 0.1 R_BLR, and becomes steep in four other objects indicating R_in ~ 0.5 R_BLR. The flat 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous ejection starting at the accretion disk corona. The steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an AGN-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. Seven of these eight objects, which have a flat or steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope, reside at the Eddington ratios L/L_Edd &lt; 0.3, and four of the remaining five objects, where the 8.4-23.6 GHz fluxes are too faint to significantly constrain the slope, reside at L/L_Edd &gt; 0.3. The 8.4-23.6 GHz radio emission in the high L/L_Edd objects may be weak due to more extended emission from a radiation pressure driven wind. Future sub-millimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.</description>

      <title>Fate and detectability of rare gas hydride ions in nova ejecta: A case study with nova templates</title>

Abstract: HeH$^+$ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH$^+$, ArH$^+$, and NeH$^+$) to investigate their formation in harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae 1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH$^+$, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit on the surface brightness of HeH$^+$ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20,000 K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the polarization spectra of the nucleus of 3C 270. We confirm that the polarization angle of both the continuum and the emission lines are close to perpendicular to the jet direction after careful correction of interstellar polarization, which indicates polar scattering. The Stokes flux spectrum resembles the total flux spectrum, with no need for a broad component from the Broad Line Region. Over 94% of the Seyfert I type broad line profile would be significantly detected if present in our polarized flux spectrum. We favor that we are mostly likely observing beamed synchrotron instead of Big Blue Bump, and the innermost Narrow Line Region through reflection. This makes 3C 270 the third known case, after NGC 4258 and Centaurus A, where only narrow lines (and beamed continuum, if present) are scattered, with no evidence of an underlying Big Blue Bump.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by Doi et al. (2021) reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds.

(2021) proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($&lt;0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The interdependence between density PDF, CMF and IMF and their relation with Mach number in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass bias for galaxy groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of galaxy clusters are commonly measured from X-ray observations under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). This technique is known to underestimate the true mass systematically. The fiducial FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulation predicts the median hydrostatic mass bias to increase from $b_\text{HSE} \equiv (M_\text{HSE,500c}-M_\text{500c})/M_\text{500c} \approx -0.1$ to -0.2 when the true mass increases from group to cluster mass scales. However, the bias is nearly independent of the hydrostatic mass. The scatter at fixed true mass is minimum for $M_\text{500c}\sim 10^{14}~\text{M}_\odot$, where $\sigma(b_\text{HSE})\approx 0.1$, but increases rapidly towards lower and higher masses. At a fixed true mass, the hydrostatic masses increase (decrease) with redshift on group (cluster) scales, and the scatter increases. The bias is insensitive to the choice of analytic functions assumed to represent the density and temperature profiles, but it is sensitive to the goodness of fit, with poorer fits corresponding to a stronger median bias and a larger scatter. The bias is also sensitive to the strength of stellar and AGN feedback. Models predicting lower gas fractions yield more (less) biased masses for groups (clusters). The scatter in the bias at fixed true mass is due to differences in the pressure gradients rather than in the temperature at $R_\text{500c}$. The total kinetic energies within $r_\text{500c}$ in low- and high-mass clusters are sub- and super-virial, respectively, though all become sub-virial when external pressure is accounted for. Analyses of the terms in the virial and Euler equations suggest that non-thermal motions, including rotation, account for most of the hydrostatic mass bias. However, we find that the mass bias estimated from X-ray luminosity weighted profiles strongly overestimates the deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. I. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Initial Conditions Beyond CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $72$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only N-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra, $P(k)$ for: i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}&gt;1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints due to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 &lt; 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 &lt; 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for DM physics.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way (MW) analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold DM is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models), as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm DM (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wave numbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wave number and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wave numbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta&gt;0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at 95\% confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}&lt;0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.</description>

      <title>The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16$-$262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old ($\sim$34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio $\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with $\alpha-$viscosity $\lesssim10^{-4}$. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at $\sim$30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Data analysis of the NISP instrument for the Euclid mission: from the first validation tests on ground up to the verification phase after launch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11613</link>

Abstract: The Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral on July 1st, 2023, is dedicated to studying dark matter and dark energy from its orbit at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. It is equipped with two instruments: the visual imager (VIS) and the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). The Euclid Wide Survey (Scaramella et al. 2022) will cover approximately 14500 deg2 of the extragalactic sky, and will be complemented by the Euclid Deep Survey that will cover about 40 deg2 and achieve two magnitudes fainter depth. Several ground-test campaigns were performed to assess NISP instrument basic functionalities and performances, some highlights will be reviewed in this thesis. The analysis comprises two key aspects: the evaluation of NISP image data acquired during ground-tests and during commissioning, and the verification of instrument performance in spectroscopic mode through the use of pixel-level simulated images. The analysis includes the characterisation of NISP detectors, from instrumental background to point-spread function (PSF) evaluations, confirming that NISP performance is well within the Euclid requirement. We introduce a calibration methodology to estimate the filter wheel assembly position from PSF distortions that have been successfully applied during the commissioning and will continue to be used during the mission for calibration purpose. Additionally, we investigated noise events that occur during image acquisition, with a particular focus on \v{S}snowballs\v{S} and cosmic ray tracks. Finally, we present a spectroscopic pixel-level simulation campaign of the NISP instrument, where spectral energy distributions were generated and processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of Planetary Nebulae with PG1159 central stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of 26 PNe with PG1159-type central stars known till date and compare them with the properties of PNe having [WR], $wels$ and hydrogen-rich central stars published earlier. We use archival photometric measurements of $2MASS$ for near-IR analysis and $WISE$ and $IRAS$ data for mid- and far-IR analysis and derive the IR properties of PG1159-PNe. We analyze the IR colour-colour diagrams of PG1159-PNe and compare them with the other three groups of PNe. Similar to the [WR]-PNe, many PG1159-PNe also show large amount of near-IR emission from the hot-dust component but their AGB dust is relatively cooler. We also report here the dust colour temperatures, dust masses, dust-to-gas mass ratios, IR luminosities and IR excess of PG1159-PNe and plot them against their surface H$\beta$ brightness (age) and compare them with the distribution of other groups of PNe. The IR luminosity and dust temperature show strong correlation with surface H$\beta$ brightness, however, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and IR excess do not show any trend. While the mean dust mass has a lower value for PG1159-PNe, in compared to other groups, the average dust-to-gas mass ratio is found to be marginally larger for PG1159-PNe. An analysis of the number distribution of different groups of PNe against surface H$\beta$ brightness shows that a) younger [WR]-, $wels$- and normal-PNe have a similar distribution indicating that they all have evolved from the AGB in a similar way, b) while there is an overlap of surface H$\beta$ brightness between [WR]- and PG1159-PNe, showing an evolutionary connection between them, there exists a significant gap between the values derived for $wels$- and PG1159-PNe.</description>
