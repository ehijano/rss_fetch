      <title>Prospects of Imitating Trading Agents in the Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show how generative tools, which were successfully applied to limit order book data, can be utilized for the task of imitating trading agents. To this end, we propose a modified generative architecture based on the state-space model, and apply it to limit order book data with identified investors. The model is trained on synthetic data, generated from a heterogeneous agent-based model. Finally, we compare model's predicted distribution over different aspects of investors' actions, with the ground truths known from the agent-based model.</description>

      <title>Is All the Information in the Price? LLM Embeddings versus the EMH in Stock Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether artificial intelligence can enhance stock clustering compared to traditional methods. We consider this in the context of the semi-strong Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that prices fully reflect all public information and, accordingly, that clusters based on price information cannot be improved upon. We benchmark three clustering approaches: (i) price-based clusters derived from historical return correlations, (ii) human-informed clusters defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), and (iii) AI-driven clusters constructed from large language model (LLM) embeddings of stock-related news headlines. At each date, each method provides a classification in which each stock is assigned to a cluster. To evaluate a clustering, we transform it into a synthetic factor model following the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) framework. This enables consistent evaluation of predictive performance in a roll forward, out-of-sample test. Using S&amp;P 500 constituents from from 2022 through 2024, we find that price-based clustering consistently outperforms both rule-based and AI-based methods, reducing root mean squared error (RMSE) by 15.9% relative to GICS and 14.7% relative to LLM embeddings. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a generalizable methodology that converts any equity grouping: manual, machine, or market-driven, into a real-time factor model for evaluation; (ii) the first direct comparison of price-based, human rule-based, and AI-based clustering under identical conditions; and (iii) empirical evidence reinforcing that short-horizon return information is largely contained in prices. These results support the EMH while offering practitioners a practical diagnostic for monitoring evolving sector structures and provide academics a framework for testing alternative hypotheses about how quickly markets absorb information.</description>

      <title>Controllable Generation of Implied Volatility Surfaces with Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep generative modeling framework for controllably synthesizing implied volatility surfaces (IVSs) using a variational autoencoder (VAE). Unlike conventional data-driven models, our approach provides explicit control over meaningful shape features (e.g., volatility level, slope, curvature, term-structure) to generate IVSs with desired characteristics. In our framework, financially interpretable shape features are disentangled from residual latent factors. The target features are embedded into the VAE architecture as controllable latent variables, while the residual latent variables capture additional structure to preserve IVS shape diversity. To enable this control, IVS feature values are quantified via regression at an anchor point and incorporated into the decoder to steer generation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the generative model enables rapid generation of realistic IVSs with desired features rather than arbitrary patterns, and achieves high accuracy across both single- and multi-feature control settings. For market validity, an optional post-generation latent-space repair algorithm adjusts only the residual latent variables to remove occasional violations of static no-arbitrage conditions without altering the specified features. Compared with black-box generators, the framework combines interpretability, controllability, and flexibility for synthetic IVS generation and scenario design.</description>

      <title>(Non-Monotonic) Effects of Productivity and Credit Constraints on Equilibrium Aggregate Production in General Equilibrium Models with Heterogeneous Producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in a market economy, the aggregate production level depends not only on the aggregate variables but also on the distribution of individual characteristics (e.g., productivity, credit limit, ...). We prove that, due to financial frictions, the equilibrium aggregate production may be non-monotonic in both individual productivity and credit limit. We provide conditions (based on exogenous parameters) under which this phenomenon happens. By consequence, improving productivity or relaxing credit limit of firms may not necessarily be beneficial to economic development.</description>

      <title>To Bubble or Not to Bubble: Asset Price Dynamics and Optimality in OLG Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an overlapping generations (OLG) exchange economy with an asset that yields dividends. First, we derive general conditions, based on exogenous parameters, that give rise to three distinct scenarios: (1) only bubbleless equilibria exist, (2) a bubbleless equilibrium coexists with a continuum of bubbly equilibria, and (3) all equilibria are bubbly. Under stationary endowments and standard assumptions, we provide a complete characterization of the equilibrium set and the associated asset price dynamics. In this setting, a bubbly equilibrium exists if and only if the interest rate in the economy without the asset is strictly lower than the population growth rate and the sum of per capita dividends is finite. Second, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Pareto optimality. Finally, we investigate the relationship between asset price behaviors and the optimality of equilibria.</description>
