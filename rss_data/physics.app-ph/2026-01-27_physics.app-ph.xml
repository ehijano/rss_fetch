      <title>Near-Field Mechanical Fingerprints for THz Sensing of 'Hidden' Nanoparticles in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.</description>

      <title>Generative metamaterials based on large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials utilize intricate architectural designs to achieve advanced properties beyond those of their bulk counterparts. Existing metamaterial designs often rely on design inspirations and extensive experimental and numerical studies operated by design professionals, which can be time- and resource-consuming and limited in exploring the vast design space. Here, we transform metamaterial design by developing ChatMetamaterials based on large language models, a prompt-based generative metamaterial design engine capable of inventing architecture codes, and conducting reasoning-based diagnostics and evolution for complex metamaterial systems based on simple text prompts or hand-drawn sketches. This approach changes the way metamaterials are designed, and provides new opportunities for high-throughput metamaterial discovery.</description>

      <title>FinLN: 3D Fin Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a three-dimensional fin lithium niobate (FinLN) acoustic resonator fabricated from thick lithium niobate on insulator using deep ion etching and sidewall electrode patterning. The FinLN geometry enables strong three-dimensional acoustic confinement and enhanced electromechanical coupling while maintaining a compact device footprint. The fabricated devices operate near 300 MHz and exhibit an effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of 6.2% with a mechanical quality factor of 430, in good agreement with finite-element simulations. Compared to planar surface acoustic wave resonators fabricated on the same wafer, the FinLN configuration achieves an 1.8x enhancement in effective coupling. This work establishes FinLN as a promising platform for compact, high-performance RF MEMS and piezo-optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Modelling with Physics Informed Learning: Frameworks and Perspectives for Real-Time Control of Electrochemical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical devices (batteries, fuel cells, and electrolyzers) are in full development, driven by the green energy transition. Their real-time control requires ms predictions in order to take critical decisions during fast transients or faults. The physics behind include coupled multi-physics phenomena that conventional finite element methods cannot solve so fast with the current CPU technology. This paper evaluates the potential of physics-informed machine learning represented by three frameworks: \ac{pinn}, \ac{pideeponet}, and \ac{pino} by evaluating their training effort, inference speed, and extrapolation capacity. Our analysis reveals valuable performance trade-offs. \acp{pinn} offer simplicity for fixed problem instances but require retraining for parameter changes. \ac{pideeponet} enables operator learning across varying conditions with mesh-free geometric flexibility. \ac{pino} delivers superior performance on regular grids, with the strongest extrapolation capabilities due to spectral derivative computation and resolution invariance. \ac{pideeponet} is particularly suited for irregular, unstructured geometries (e.g., porous electrodes or complex flow fields), while \ac{pino} works best for layered, structured-grid problems (e.g., transport across stacked electrochemical layers) requiring fast inference. Possible future applications include real-time lithium concentration prediction for safe fast-charging and micro short circuit detection, water management in fuel cells, and optimal power management in electrolyzers under intermittent renewable inputs. These findings establish physics-informed operator learning as a transformative approach for next-generation electrochemical device controller technology.</description>

      <title>Understanding Heat Transport Mechanisms in Optically Transparent Thermal Loss Mitigators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically transparent thermal loss mitigators have recently seen renewed research interests owing to their increasing relevance in the realms ranging from smart windows, efficient greenhouse designs and high-performance-low-cost solar thermal systems. In depth understanding of the heat transport mechanisms and their quantification is crucial for building efficient opto-thermal management strategies for optimization of the aforementioned systems. The present work serves to identify and quantify the key heat transfer mechanisms operative in a host of optically transparent thermal loss mitigators. In particular, comprehensive experimental modelling frameworks have been developed to investigate the efficacy of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), air, vacuum (0.07mbar), transparent heat mirrors (Indium tin oxide coated glass) and aerogels (silica-based) in mitigating thermal losses. Detailed and careful experimental modelling reveals that it is imperative to employ more than one thermal loss mitigator and choose correct absorber surface orientation (relative to the irradiation direction) to maximize thermal loss mitigation. Magnitude of absorber surface stagnation temperature has been employed as the figure of merit to quantitatively compare various optically transparent thermal loss mitigators. Under un-evacuated conditions, CO2 has emerged as potent alternative to more sophisticated optically transparent thermal loss mitigators like aerogels and transparent heat mirrors. Enhancements (relative to air) on the order of 2%-7%, 46%-84%, 57%-84% and 66%-86% are observed in case of CO2, vacuum, transparent heat mirrors (vacuum) and aerogel (vacuum) respectively.</description>

      <title>On the relation between time-reversed acoustics and Green's function retrieval in space-variant and in time-variant materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The methods of time-reversed acoustics and Green's function retrieval are traditionally deployed for classical inhomogeneous, time-invariant materials. The mutual relation between these methods is well-established. Recently, similar methods have been proposed for homogeneous, time-variant materials. Here we investigate their mutual relation and their relation with the corresponding methods in classical materials. For this analysis we make use of the fact that the wave equations for both types of material are similar, with the roles of time and space interchanged. However, the principle of causality holds for both types of material, hence, here the roles of time and space are not interchanged. We find that:
  (1) whereas classical time-reversed acoustics involves emission of a time-reversed single-component wave field from a (ideally closed) boundary into the inhomogeneous material, its idealized counterpart involves emission of a sign-reversed two-component wave field, recorded in a time-reversed material, from a single time instant into the actual time-variant material;
  (2) whereas classical Green's function retrieval involves temporal crosscorrelation of wave fields at two space locations in response to single-component sources on a (ideally closed) boundary, its counterpart involves spatial crosscorrelation of wave fields at two time instants in response to two-component sources at a single time instant.</description>

      <title>Inverter-Based Differential Amplifiers With Back-Gate Feedback Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feeding the common-source amplifier output to the back-gate terminal in fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) technology exploits the linearizing effect of negative feedback. Analysis and simulation results in 22 nm FD-SOI show that back-gate feedback sets the overall gain approximately independent of the load, contributes no additional noise, and improves linearity by the back-gate voltage gain. Third-order intercept point (IP3) enhancement is at least $60\times$ compared to without feedback in inverter-based, or complementary common-source, differential amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Polarization Switching of Piezoelectric Films due to Proximity of Ferroelectric Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire thermodynamical approach and finite element modelling, we studied the influence of nanoclusters shape on the polarization switching and domain nucleation emerging in otherwise non-switchable piezoelectric films due to the proximity of ferroelectric nanoclusters. The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Polyurethane-Based Scintillators for Neutron and Gamma Radiation Detection in Medical and Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic scintillators using a solid polyurethane (PU) matrix have been introduced to combine the robustness of a construction material with scintillating properties that allow gamma rays and fast neutrons to be detected efficiently and at low cost. This work compares two corresponding materials, the older M600 and the more recent M700, with EJ-276D and EJ-200 representing common plastic scintillators with and without pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities, respectively. Characterization measurements were performed with small samples of 26 mm diameter and 10 mm height, which were coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and simultaneously exposed to 252Cf fission neutrons and 137Cs gamma rays. M700 turned out to provide the best PSD performance and about the same light yield as EJ-276D, while its light pulses exhibit a shorter pulse decay. An accelerated ageing process applied in between two test campaigns was too short to trigger distinct performance degradation in any of the materials, though optical degradation was visible in EJ-276D and in EJ-200 but not in the PU-based materials. Nevertheless, the extremely robust polyurethane matrix promises advantages in medical and industrial applications where resilience and long-term stability are of crucial importance.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic roughness evolution in film growth on weakly interacting substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin film deposition on weakly interacting substrates exhibits a unique growth mode characterized by initially strong island formation and rapidly increasing roughness, which reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases as the film returns to a smooth morphology. Here we show this rough-to-smooth growth mode experimentally for two molecular systems with substantially different geometries, namely, the effectively spherical buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and the disk-like 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN). This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of dephasing-induced decoherence in continuous-variable quantum systems using non-Gaussian probe states. By purifying the open system, we identify optimal probes, specifically squeezed cat and symmetric squeezed compass states, via quantum Fisher information. These results are in agreement with numerical simulation. In settings where the intra-cavity field is inaccessible and standard measurements are impractical, utilizing an ancilla approach where a qubit traverses or interacts with the cavity field, leading to measurement of the qubit, hence allowing estimation of the dephasing rate via Wigner function reconstruction or less costly marginal distribution.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Optimized Ternary Mirror Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Physics-Integrated Inference for Signal Recovery in Non-Gaussian Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance room-temperature sensing is often limited by non-stationary $1/f$ fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity. In spintronic devices, thermally activated N\'eel switching creates heavy-tailed noise that masks weak signals, defeating linear filters optimized for Gaussian statistics. Here, we introduce a physics-integrated inference framework that decouples signal morphology from stochastic transients using a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology. By learning the temporal signatures of N\'eel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG.

      <title>Potential of Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures to study the drag and two-stream instability effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18369</link>

Abstract: Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are proposed to investigate the drag and two-stream instability effects. In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.</description>

      <title>Uncooled Poisson Bolometer for High-Speed Event-Based Long-wave Thermal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-based vision provides high-speed, energy-efficient sensing for applications such as autonomous navigation and motion tracking. However, implementing this technology in the long-wave infrared remains a significant challenge. Traditional infrared sensors are hindered by slow thermal response times or the heavy power requirements of cryogenic cooling. Here, we introduce the first event-based infrared detector operating in a Poisson-counting regime. This is realized with a spintronic Poisson bolometer capable of broadband detection from 0.8-14$\mu\text{m}$. In this regime, infrared signals are detected through statistically resolvable changes in stochastic switching events. This approach enables room-temperature operation with high timing resolution. Our device achieves a maximum event rate of 1,250 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution of conventional uncooled microbolometers by a factor of 4. Power consumption is kept low at 0.2$\mu$W per pixel. This work establishes an operating principle for infrared sensing and demonstrates a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient, event-driven thermal imaging.</description>

      <title>Role of transfer films and interfacial cracking in metallic sliding wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of wear particles in metallic sliding contacts remains debated. Classical views based on cold-welded junctions suggest that plastic yielding of the real contact area should lead to large wear coefficients, in apparent contradiction with the small values typically measured for metals. Here we argue that this discrepancy can be resolved if most junctions do not directly produce wear particles, but instead cause metal transfer and the formation of a weakly bound transfer film. Wear then occurs intermittently when fragments of this film detach due to crack propagation at the interface between the transfer film and the underlying bulk metal. We perform unlubricated reciprocating sliding experiments on nominally smooth stainless steel, brass, and aluminum. For steel on steel, the wear mass loss shows an initial stage with negligible mass change up to a sliding distance of $\sim 2.4 \ {\rm m}$, followed by a linear regime. Transfer-film formation in dissimilar-metal contacts is evidenced by optical imaging, net mass gain of the steel slider, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and the collected debris is flake-like. These observations support a transfer-film-controlled wear mechanism associated with cold-welded junctions.</description>

      <title>Gear-tuning meta-shaft for low-frequency torsional vibration suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastructures with band gaps provide a new solution for the torsional vibration attenuation in shaft systems, while tunable band gaps remain challenging, typically relying on additional physical fields or complex assembly processes. In this study, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft with self-locking gear (SLG) resonators is proposed, where a simple gear-shifting mechanism replaces complex tuning methods to achieve low-frequency torsional vibration suppression in tunable frequency ranges. First, as the key components of the SLG resonator, six inner curved beams are designed to provide precisely tunable torsional stiffness of the resonator through their deformed shapes controlled by shifting the gear teeth on the edge of the resonator. Also, based on the gear-shifting mechanism, the SLG resonator achieves resonant frequency modulation and opens tunable low-frequency torsional band gaps consistent with theoretical predictions. Then, the SLG resonators are periodically attached to a uniform shaft to construct a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft, whose dynamic response is obtained using numerical simulations to evaluate its torsional wave attenuation performance. Finally, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft prototype is fabricated and experiments are carried out to study the propagation characteristics of torsional waves therein. Through the consistency observed among theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results, the gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft is found to exhibit excellent attenuation performance in the tunable low-frequency band gaps. Therefore, the proposed gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft paves a new way for low-frequency torsional vibration suppression.</description>

      <title>Zero- to low-field J-spectroscopy with a diamond magnetometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report measurements of zero- to ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) signals at frequencies of a few hertz with a diamond-based magnetic sensor. The sensing diamond is a truncated pyramid with 0.18 mm height and a 0.5 mm x 0.5mm base. The minimum stand-off distance is &lt; 1 mm, and the sensor sensitivity is 13 pT/(Hz)^(1/2) at frequencies f above 5 Hz with 1/f-like behavior at lower frequencies. NMR signals were generated via signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) parahydrogen-based hyperpolarization resulting in zero-field signals at 1.7 Hz and 3.4 Hz corresponding to the expected hetero-nuclear J-coupling pattern of acetonitrile. This work demonstrates a magnet-free platform for detecting chemically specific NMR signals at ultra-low frequencies paving the way for portable noninvasive diagnostics in microscopic sample volumes for biomedicine, industrial sensing through metal enclosures, and field-deployable quantum analytical devices.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06811v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target W h/day and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields ~0.6-0.8 kW h/day to a 1m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^2$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers ~30-50 kW h/day at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 10- to 15-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains originate from anisotropic residual stress fields, revealed by Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which delay crack initiation events. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.</description>

Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, microampere currents, 2 MHz speeds and ~250 fJ per nonlinear operation, with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>
