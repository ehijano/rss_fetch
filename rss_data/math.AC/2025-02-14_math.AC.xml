      <title>On transfer homomorphisms in commutative rings with zero-divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the arithmetic of monoids of regular elements of commutative rings with zero-divisors. Our focus is on Krull rings and on some of their generalizations (such as weakly Krull rings and C-rings). We establish sufficient conditions for a subring $R$ of a Krull ring $D$ guaranteeing that the inclusion $R^{\bullet} \hookrightarrow D^{\bullet}$ of the respective monoids of regular elements is a transfer homomorphism. The arithmetic of the Krull monoid $D^{\bullet}$ is well studied and the existence of a transfer homomorphism implies that $R^{\bullet}$ and $D^{\bullet}$ share many arithmetic properties.</description>

      <title>The $F$-pure threshold of a Schubert cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $F$-pure threshold is the characteristic $p$ counter part of the log canonical threshold in characteristic zero. It is a numerical invariant associated to the singularities of a variety, hence computing its value is important. We give a closed formula for the $F$-pure threshold of the irrelevant maximal ideal of Schubert cycles, which are the homogeneous coordinate rings of Schubert subvarieties of a Grassmannian. The main point of the computation is to give an explicit formula for the $a$-invariant of a Schubert cycle. The derivation of both formulas is made possible through the combinatorics of the underlying poset of these rings.</description>

      <title>On extensions of Cohen Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend Cohen structure theorem beyond local rings. Both Cohen structure theorem and Nagata's generalization of it are special cases of our results. We investigate for which rings $R$ there exists a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$ such that the canonical projection $R\to R/\mathfrak{m}$ has a section, so that $R/\mathfrak{m}$ is isomorphic to a field $\kappa$ contained in $R$. We present two equivalent characterizations of this property and use them to exhibit two classes of rings that satisfy it. Moreover, we provide several examples (not necessarily local or complete local), as well as methods to construct new examples.</description>

      <title>Realizing resolutions of powers of extremal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal ideals are a class of square-free monomial ideals which dominate and determine many algebraic invariants of powers of all square-free monomial ideals. For example, the $r^{th}$ power ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ of the extremal ideal on $q$ generators has the maximum Betti numbers among the $r^{th}$ power of any square-free monomial ideal with $q$ generators. In this paper we study the combinatorial and geometric structure of the (minimal) free resolutions of powers of square-free monomial ideals via the resolutions of powers of extremal ideals. Although the end results are algebraic, this problem has a natural interpretation in terms of polytopes and discrete geometry. Our guiding conjecture is that all powers ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ of extremal ideals have resolutions supported on their Scarf simplicial complexes, and thus their resolutions are as small as possible. This conjecture is known to hold for $r \leq 2$ or $q \leq 4$. In this paper we prove the conjecture holds for $r=3$ and any $q\geq 1$ by giving a complete description of the Scarf complex of ${\mathcal{E}_q}^3$. This effectively gives us a sharp bound on the betti numbers and projective dimension of the third power of any square-free momomial ideal. For large $i$ and $q$, our bounds on the $i^{th}$ betti numbers are an exponential improvement over previously known bounds. We also describe a large number of faces of the Scarf complex of ${\mathcal{E}_q}^r$ for any $r,q \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Projective modules over Rees-like algebras and its monoid extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Rees-like algebra of dimension $d$ and $N$ a commutative partially cancellative torsion-free seminormal monoid. We prove the following results. \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $P$ be a finitely generated projective $A$-module of $\rank\geq d$. Then $(i)$ $P$ has a unimodular element; $(ii)$ The action of $\EL(A\oplus P)$ on $\Um(A\oplus P)$ is transitive.
  \item Let $P$ be a finitely generated projective $A[N]$-module of $\rank~r$. Then $(i)$ $P$ has a unimodular element for $r\geq\max\{3,d\}$; $(ii)$ The action of $\EL(A[N]\oplus P)$ on $\Um(A[N]\oplus P)$ is transitive for $r\geq\max\{2,d\}$. \end{enumerate} These improve the classical results of Serre \cite{Se58} and Bass \cite{Ba64}.</description>

      <title>Steenrod closed parameter ideals in the mod-$2$ cohomology of $A_4$ and $SO(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the parameter ideals in $H^*(BA_4;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and in the Dickson algebra $H^*(BSO(3);\mathbb{F}_2)$ that are closed under Steenrod operations. Consequently, we obtain restrictions on the dimensions $n,m$ for which $A_4$ (and $SO(3)$) can act freely on $S^n\times S^m$.</description>

      <title>A Galois theorem for machine learning: Functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds via lightweight invariant features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical formulation for machine learning of (1) functions on symmetric matrices that are invariant with respect to the action of permutations by conjugation, and (2) functions on point clouds that are invariant with respect to rotations, reflections, and permutations of the points. To achieve this, we provide a general construction of generically separating invariant features using ideas inspired by Galois theory. We construct $O(n^2)$ invariant features derived from generators for the field of rational functions on $n\times n$ symmetric matrices that are invariant under joint permutations of rows and columns. We show that these invariant features can separate all distinct orbits of symmetric matrices except for a measure zero set; such features can be used to universally approximate invariant functions on almost all weighted graphs. For point clouds in a fixed dimension, we prove that the number of invariant features can be reduced, generically without losing expressivity, to $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points. We combine these invariant features with DeepSets to learn functions on symmetric matrices and point clouds with varying sizes. We empirically demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on molecule property regression and point cloud distance prediction.</description>

      <title>Descent and generation for noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work shows forms of descent, in the fppf, h and \'{e}tale topologies, for strong generation of the bounded derived category of a noncommutative coherent algebra over a scheme. Even for (commutative) schemes this yields new perspectives. As a consequence we exhibit new examples where these bounded derived categories admit strong generators. We achieve our main results by leveraging the action of the scheme on the coherent algebra, allowing us to lift statements into the noncommutative setting. In particular, this leads to interesting applications regarding generation for Azumaya algebras.</description>
