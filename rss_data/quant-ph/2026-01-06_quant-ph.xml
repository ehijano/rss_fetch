      <title>Sample Complexity for Embedded Multipartite Entanglement Witness via Pauli and Clifford Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting multipartite entanglement in many qubit systems is measurement-intensive, motivating protocols that estimate only selected observables with provable efficiency. In this work we use the classical shadow protocol to study the sample complexity required to estimate a family of subsystem $n$-partite entanglement witness embedded in an larger $N$-qubit system. We derive ensemble dependent variance bounds that lead to qualitatively distinct scaling for the snapshots cost at fixed additive error $\epsilon$ with numerical simulations confirm these trends, exhibiting a clear crossover from Pauli favorable performance for local witness to Clifford favorable performance as the witness becomes more global.</description>

      <title>The Quantum State Continuity Problem and Temporal Enforcement Against Fork Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantum State Continuity Problem (QSCP), a security objective orthogonal to identity authentication that captures whether a systems current execution is a legitimate continuation of a unique past execution. We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of multi-fluxonium-qubits under Non-Markovian TLS noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research on open quantum systems is important for both quantum computing and quantum sensing. So far, we can only use the main equation to make an approximate description. The dynamics of a single Fluxonium qubit under Markovian environment satisfied Lindblad Master Equation. In experiments, pulse sequence dynamic decoupling (DD) can enhance the coherence of qubits and effectively suppress noise. Two Fluxonium qubits sensitive to two-level systems (TLS) noise. TLS formed by material defects results in noise with significant non-Markovian characteristics. The dynamics of non-Markovian noise satisfied the post Markov Master Equation (PMME). The TLS noise spectrum is mainly concentrated in low frequencies, so traditional DD cannot effectively suppress TLS noise. The relaxation and dephasing behavior with a complex dynamic characteristics. Based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we put forward a novel DD sequence and design a TLS-tailored dynamical decoupling protocol by optimizing pulse locations to minimize noise power spectral overlap with the Lorentzian shape. Using PMME-consistent framework, we can obtain a stronger low frequency suppression and significantly prolong both Bell-based fidelity and entanglement. We explore specific DD design and precise modeling of entanglement dynamics under non-Markovian TLS noise. Our dynamical decoupling protocol can effectively improve entanglement gates fidelity in NISQ quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Four-Photon Interference with a High-Efficiency Quantum Dot Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Impersonating Quantum Secrets over Classical Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a simple eavesdropper listening in on classical communication between potentially entangled quantum parties will eventually be able to impersonate any of the parties. Furthermore, the attack is efficient if one-way puzzles do not exist. As a direct consequence, one-way puzzles are implied by reusable authentication schemes over classical channels with quantum pre-shared secrets that are potentially evolving.
  As an additional application, we show that any quantum money scheme that can be verified through only classical queries to any oracle cannot be information-theoretically secure. This significantly generalizes the prior work by Ananth, Hu, and Yuen (ASIACRYPT'23) where they showed the same but only for the specific case of random oracles. Therefore, verifying black-box constructions of quantum money inherently requires coherently evaluating the underlying cryptographic tools, which may be difficult for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Molchanov's Formula and Quantum Walks: A Probabilistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a robust link between quantum dynamics and classical ones by deriving probabilistic representation for both continuous time and discrete time quantum walks. We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Single-Step Hybrid CV-DV Transfer of Multipartite W States Using Cat-State Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic hybrid continuous-variable-discrete-variable (CV-DV) scheme for the single-step transfer of an $n$-qubit W state encoded in photonic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat-state qubits within a circuit QED architecture. Logical qubits are encoded in even- and odd-parity cat states of bosonic modes, while effective Raman-type interactions between resonator pairs are mediated by a single superconducting flux qutrit operating in the dispersive regime. The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable hybrid CV-DV entanglement transfer using current circuit QED technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimisation applied to the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the emerging non-variational Quantum Walk-based Optimisation Algorithm (NV-QWOA) for solving small instances of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). NV-QWOA is benchmarked against classical heuristics, the MaxMin Ant System (MMAS) and Greedy Local Search (GLS), as well as the Grover quantum search algorithm, which serves as a quantum baseline. Performance is evaluated using two metrics: the number of objective function evaluations and the number of algorithm iterations required to consistently reach optimal or near optimal solutions across QAP instances with 5 to 10 facilities. The motivation for this study stems from limitations of both classical exact methods and current quantum algorithms. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as QAOA and VQE, while widely studied, suffer from costly parameter tuning and barren plateaus that hinder convergence. By adopting a non-variational approach, this work explores a potentially more efficient and scalable quantum strategy for combinatorial optimisation. The results provide a direct comparative analysis between classical and quantum frameworks, characterising the average case performance of NV-QWOA. Our findings highlight the practical utility of quantum walks for complex combinatorial problems and establish a foundation for future quantum optimisation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian and Thermodynamic Signatures in the Classicality Assessment via Kolmogorov Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov consistency condition (KCC) defines the statistical boundary between classical and quantum dynamics. Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Completeness of Eigenstates in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delineate the scope of research on the completeness of eigenstates in quantum mechanics. Based on the limit of the potential function at infinity, the proof of completeness is divided into eight cases, and theoretical proofs or numerical simulations are provided for each case. We present the definition of orthonormalization for general free states and the solution to the normalization coefficients, as well as a general set of initial states, which simplifies and concretizes the proof of completeness. Additionally, we define the spectral function for continuous energy eigenvalues. By taking the spectral function as the original integral variable of the expansion function, the relationship between the measured probability amplitude and the expansion function is endowed with the physical meaning of coordinate-momentum transformation.</description>

      <title>Constant Depth Digital-Analog Counterdiabatic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a digital-analog quantum computing framework that enables counterdiabatic protocols to be implemented at constant circuit depth, allowing fast and resource-efficient quantum state preparation on current quantum hardware. Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Environmental Memory with Reinforcement Learning in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Wigner Localisation with the IBM Heron 2 Quantum Processor: A Proof-of-Principle Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a high-fidelity digital quantum simulation of Wigner localisation in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron system using a 6-qubit segment of the state-of-the-art \textbf{IBM\,Heron\,2} quantum processor. By mapping the Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian onto a 6-qubit ring lattice, we reconstruct the ground-state energy landscape for a 2-electron Wigner dimer across fifteen interaction regimes in the range $U \in [5, 75]$. This study serves as a rigorous \textbf{benchmarking} exercise, translating foundational experimental models originally developed for electrons on liquid helium into the domain of modern quantum computing. Leveraging the enhanced gate fidelity and tunable coupler architecture of the Heron 2, we demonstrate that the digital simulation accurately captures the energy minimisation trends associated with Wigner dimer formation, achieving a relative error below 7\% in the strong-interaction limit. Our results provide a crucial \textbf{proof-of-principle} validation for using superconducting quantum hardware to probe strongly correlated phases of matter with high precision, establishing a baseline for future simulations beyond the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis of autonomous quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional quantum thermodynamic frameworks associate work to energy exchanges induced by unitary transformations generated by external controls, and heat to energy exchanges induced by bath interaction. Recently, a framework was introduced aiming at extending the thermodynamic formalism to genuine quantum settings, also referred to as autonomous quantum systems: free from external controls, only quantum systems interacting with each other. In this paper, we apply such a thermodynamic framework to common experimental situations of interacting quantum systems. In situations where traditional frameworks detect only heat exchanges, the recent autonomous thermodynamic framework points at work exchanges based on two mechanisms: population inversion and coherence generation / consumption. Such mechanisms are well known in the literature for being related to work expenditure and extraction, in particular in relation with ergotropy, which emphasizes the relevance of the autonomous framework and the limitations of traditional ones. Furthermore, the autonomous framework also identifies a genuine non-unitary mechanism of work exchange related to athermality. %, also pointed out as a resource for work extraction. Finally, in the semi-classical limit, the autonomous framework identifies all energy exchanges as pure work, but distinguishes between local work and interaction energy.
  Our results show that the autonomous framework provides a refined analysis of work exchange mechanisms in the quantum realm and serves as a consistent approach to analyze thermodynamic processes in realistic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Assessing the entanglement of three coupled harmonic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement serves as a key phenomenon in understanding correlations in many-body systems, but analytical results remain scarce for coupled three-body oscillators. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a geometrical diagonalization approach that constrains Euler angles, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom in the entanglement analysis. It consists of deriving analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under the bipartitions $(x|yz)$, $(y|xz)$, and $(xy|z)$ using the Wigner function framework. Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $\theta$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation. Moreover, we reveal the symmetry relations, notably $S_{Ly}[(n,m,l),\theta]=S_{Lz}[(n,m,l),-\theta]$ and an intrinsic symmetry within $(x|yz)$. Hence, we clarify how excitation levels and mixing angles create and enhance entanglement in the three coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering in Three Coupled Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-\theta),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-\theta)$. Therefore, we elucidate how excitation levels and mixing angles generate and enhance steering in three coupled harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a two-dimensional quantum glass state at high temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder in quantum many-body systems can drive transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic phases, yet the nature--and even the existence--of these transitions remains intensely debated. Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Bond Additivity and Persistent Geometric Imprints of Entanglement in Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the intricate structure of entanglement in quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge, as standard measures often obscure underlying geometric details. In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\{\omega_j\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $\omega_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kaczmarz Algorithm for Solving Linear Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum linear system solving algorithm based on the Kaczmarz method, a widely used workhorse for large linear systems and least-squares problems that updates the solution by enforcing one equation at a time. Its simplicity and low memory cost make it a practical choice across data regression, tomographic reconstruction, and optimization. In contrast to many existing quantum linear solvers, our method does not rely on oracle access to query entries, relaxing a key practicality bottleneck. In particular, when the rank of the system of interest is sufficiently small and the rows of the matrix of interest admit an appropriate structure, we achieve circuit complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log m\right)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\varepsilon$ is the target precision, without dependence on the sparsity $s$, and could possibly be without explicit dependence on condition number $\kappa$. This shows a significant improvement over previous quantum linear solvers where the dependence on $\kappa,s$ is at least linear. At the same time, when the rows have an arbitrary structure and have at most $s$ nonzero entries, we obtain the circuit depth $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log s\right)$ using extra $\mathcal{O}(s)$ ancilla qubits, so the depth grows only logarithmically with sparsity $s$. When the sparsity $s$ grows as $\mathcal{O}(\log m)$, then our method can achieve an exponential improvement with respect to circuit depth compared to existing quantum algorithms, while using (asymptotically) the same amount of qubits.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Data Center Architectures: A Performance and Scalability Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.</description>

      <title>Distant Entanglement Generation between Magnon and Superconducting Qubits in Magnon-Mediated Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F &gt; 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 &gt; 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient Heisenberg-limited Quantum Sensing via Indefinite-Causal-Order Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resources can, in principle, enable Heisenberg-limited (HL) sensing, yet no-go theorems imply that HL scaling is generically unattainable in realistic noisy devices. While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Restarted Lanczos Enables Chemically-Accurate Shallow Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence between Hardy-type paradox and Logical Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardy-type paradoxes offer elegant, inequality-free proof of quantum contextuality. In this work, we introduce a unified logical formulation for general Hardy-type paradoxes, which we term logical Hardy-type paradoxes. We prove that for any finite scenario, the existence of a logical Hardy-type paradox is equivalent to logical contextuality. Specially, strong contextuality is equivalent to logical Hardy-type paradoxes with success probability SP = 1. These results generalize prior work on (2,k,2), (2,2,d), and n-cycle scenarios, and resolve a misconception that such equivalence does not hold for general scenarios [1]. We analyse the logical Hardy-type paradoxes on the (2,2,2) and (2,3,3) Bell scenarios, as well as the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario. We show that the KCBS scenario admits only one kind of Hardy-type paradox, achieving a success probability of SP \approx 10.56% for a specific parameter setting.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Quantum Optimization via Hamming Weight Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization with strict linear constraints underpins applications in drug discovery, power grids, logistics, and finance, yet remains computationally demanding for classical algorithms, especially at large scales. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising quantum framework, but conventional penalty-based formulations distort optimization landscapes and demand deep circuits, undermining scalability on near-term hardware. In this work, we introduce Hamming Weight Operators, a new class of constraint-aware operators that confine quantum evolution strictly within the feasible subspace. Building on this idea, we develop Adaptive Hamming Weight Operator QAOA, which dynamically selects the most effective operators to construct shallow, problem-tailored circuits. We validate our approach on benchmark tasks from both finance and high-energy physics, specifically portfolio optimization and two-jet clustering with energy balance. Across these problems, our method inherently satisfies all constraints by construction, converges faster, and achieves higher Approximation Ratios than penalty-based QAOA, while requiring roughly half as many gates. By embedding constraint-aware operators into an adaptive variational framework, our approach establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient pathway for solving practical constrained optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Variance Squeezing of V-type Atom in Dissipative Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Ref.\cite{Riccardi A}, we investigate the entropy and variance squeezing of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity, and discuss the influences of parameters including the spontaneously generated interference (SGI) ($\theta$), the cavity-environment coupling ($\gamma_0/\kappa$) and the atom-cavity detuning ($\Delta$) on the atomic squeezing by using different initial states. The results show that no squeezing of $S_y$ occurs under any condition and that variance squeezing of $S_x$ appears only when $\Delta&gt;0$. Entropy squeezing quantifies quantum fluctuations more precisely than variance squeezing. Moreover, the atomic squeezing of $S_x$ clearly depends on $\theta$, $\gamma_0/\kappa$, $\Delta$ and the initial state. These findings are meaningful for quantum information processing as an ultra-low-noise resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stark shifts introduce additional phases that constrain the set of entangling gates that can be prepared via two-photon transitions in the strong Rydberg blockade limit. For non-independently addressed qubits, by controlling the absolute phases and the local amplitudes of the pulses at each qubit, we show that any two-qubit phase gate can be prepared with high fidelity using a three-pulse sequence. Based on these insights, we introduce two robust control schemes tailored to different phase gates that yield better results with pulse sequences of either even or odd length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zero-mode corner states in the gap of two-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model are robust to infinitesimal perturbations that preserve chiral symmetry. However, we demonstrate that this general belief is no longer valid in large-sized systems. To reveal the higher-order topology of non-Hermitian systems, we establish a correspondence between the stable zero-mode singular states and the topologically protected corner states of energy spectrum in the thermodynamic limit. Within this framework, the number of zero-mode singular values is directly linked to the number of mid-gap corner states. The winding numbers in real space can be defined to count the number of stable zero-mode singular states. Our results formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence for both static and Floquet non-Hermitian systems, where topology arises intrinsically from the non-Hermiticity, even without symmetries.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Simulation in the Low-Energy Subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulations are key subroutines in adiabatic quantum computation, quantum control, and quantum many-body physics, where quantum dynamics often happen in the low-energy sector. In contrast to time-independent Hamiltonian simulations, a comprehensive understanding of quantum simulation algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonians under the low-energy assumption remains limited hitherto. In this paper, we investigate how much we can improve upon the standard performance guarantee assuming the initial state is supported on a low-energy subspace. In particular, we compute the Trotter number of digital quantum simulation based on product formulas for time-dependent spin Hamiltonians under the low-energy assumption that the initial state is supported on a small number of low-energy eigenstates, and show improvements over the standard cost for simulating full unitary simulations. Technically, we derive the low-energy simulation error with commutator scaling for product formulas by leveraging adiabatic perturbation theory to analyze the time-variant energy spectrum of the underlying Hamiltonian. We further discuss the applications to simulations of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics and adiabatic state preparation. Finally, we prove a lower bound of query complexity for generic time-dependent Hamiltonian simulations.</description>

      <title>Utilizing intermediate states in quantum annealing for multi-objective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate obtaining intermediate quantum states during the quantum annealing process to address the limitation of the linear weighted sum method in multi-objective optimization, which inherently fails to reach non-convex regions of the Pareto front. We validate this approach through physical experiments utilizing quench-based readout and numerical simulations assuming ideal mid-anneal measurements. Both methods consistently demonstrate a clear trade-off where earlier timing enhances diversity of the solutions, whereas later timing ensures convergence to non-dominated solutions. Notably, a practical compromise timing balances both metrics. The qualitative agreement between practical quench and ideal simulation indicates the potential of accessing the intermediate states for comprehensive Pareto front exploration.</description>

      <title>Learning Relationship between Quantum Walks and Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast computational algorithms are in constant demand, and their development has been driven by advances such as quantum speedup and classical acceleration. This paper intends to study search algorithms based on quantum walks in quantum computation and sampling algorithms based on Langevin dynamics in classical computation. On the quantum side, quantum walk-based search algorithms can achieve quadratic speedups over their classical counterparts. In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.
  Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that, in terms of the Le Cam deficiency distance, a quantum walk with randomization is asymptotically equivalent to underdamped Langevin dynamics, whereas the quantum walk without randomization is not asymptotically equivalent due to its high-frequency oscillatory behavior. We further discuss the implications of these equivalence and nonequivalence results for the computational and inferential properties of the associated algorithms in machine learning tasks. Our findings offer new insight into the relationship between quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as the intrinsic mechanisms underlying quantum speedup and classical gradient acceleration.</description>

      <title>Generation of circular polarized high-order harmonics from single color quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.</description>

      <title>Scattering Cross Section Formula Derived From Macroscopic Model of Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the justification of the statement, commonly (explicitly or implicitly) used in quantum scattering theory, that for a free non-relativistic quantum particle with initial wave function $\Psi_0(\boldsymbol{x})$, surrounded by detectors along a sphere of large radius $R$, the probability distribution of the detection time and place has asymptotic density (i.e., scattering cross section) $\sigma(\boldsymbol{x},t)= m^3 \hbar^{-3} R t^{-4} |\widehat{\Psi}_0(m\boldsymbol{x}/\hbar t)|^2$ with $\widehat{\Psi}_0$ the Fourier transform of $\Psi_0$. We give two derivations of this formula, based on different macroscopic models of the detection process. The first one consists of a negative imaginary potential of strength $\lambda&gt;0$ in the detector volume (i.e., outside the sphere of radius $R$) in the limit $R\to\infty,\lambda\to 0, R\lambda\to \infty$. The second one consists of repeated nearly-projective measurements of (approximately) the observable $1_{|\boldsymbol{x}|&gt;R}$ at times $\mathscr{T},2\mathscr{T},3\mathscr{T},\ldots$ in the limit $R\to\infty,\mathscr{T}\to\infty,\mathscr{T}/R\to 0$; this setup is similar to that of the quantum Zeno effect, except that there one considers $\mathscr{T}\to 0$ instead of $\mathscr{T}\to\infty$. We also provide a comparison to Bohmian mechanics: while in the absence of detectors, the arrival times and places of the Bohmian trajectories on the sphere of radius $R$ have asymptotic distribution density given by the same formula as $\sigma$, their deviation from the detection times and places is not necessarily small, although it is small compared to $R$, so the effect of the presence of detectors on the particle can be neglected in the far-field regime. We also cover the generalization to surfaces with non-spherical shape, to the case of $N$ non-interacting particles, to time-dependent surfaces, and to the Dirac equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation with Rydberg ions in a Penning trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</description>

      <title>Design and Characterization of Compact Acousto-Optic-Deflector Individual Addressing System for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact design for a beam-steering system based on acousto-optic-deflectors (AODs) used as an individual addressing system for trapped-ion quantum computing. The design targets to minimize the optomechanical degrees of freedom and the optical beam paths to improve optical stability, and we successfully implemented a solution with a compact footprint of less than 1 square foot. The system characterization results show that we achieve clean Gaussian beams at 355nm wavelength with a beam steering range of $\sim$50 times the beam diameter, and an intensity crosstalk of $&lt; 9 \times 10^{-4}$ at all neighboring ions in a five-ion chain. Based on these capabilities, we experimentally demonstrate individual addressing of a 30-ion chain. We estimate the beam switching time of the AOD to be $\sim$240 ns. The compact system design is expected to provide high optical stability, providing the potential for high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum computing with long ion chains.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Strongly Correlated Bosons: From $N$-Representability to the Generalized BEC Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in reduced density matrix theory, we develop a geometric framework for describing strongly correlated lattice bosons. We first establish that translational symmetry, together with a fixed pair interaction, enables an exact functional formulation expressed solely in terms of momentum occupation numbers. Employing the constrained-search formalism and exploiting a geometric correspondence between $N$-boson configuration states and their one-particle reduced density matrices, we derive the general form of the ground-state functional. Its structure highlights the omnipresent significance of one-body $N$-representability: (i) the domain is exactly determined by the $N$-representability conditions; (ii) at its boundary, the gradient of the functional diverges repulsively, thereby generalizing the recently discovered Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) force; and (iii) an explicit expression for this boundary force follows directly from geometric arguments. These key results are demonstrated analytically for few-site lattice systems, and we illustrate the broader significance of our functional form in defining a systematic hierarchy of functional approximations.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Discrete-Time Quantum Walks and Observation of Topological Edge States in a Superconducting Qutrit Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Applications of Quantum Computing for Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.</description>

      <title>Physically natural metric-measure Lindbladian ensembles and their learning hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, a basic question at the interface of quantum information, statistical physics, and many-body dynamics is how well can one infer the structure of noise and dissipation generators from finite-time measurement statistics alone. Motivated by this question, we study the learnability and cryptographic applications of random open-system dynamics generated by Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan (GKSL) master equations. Working in the affine hull of the GKSL cone, we introduce physically motivated ensembles of random local Lindbladians via a linear parametrisation around a reference generator. On top of this geometric structure, we extend statistical query (SQ) and quantum-process statistical query (QPStat) frameworks to the open-system setting and prove exponential (in the parameter dimension $M$) lower bounds on the number of queries required to learn random Lindbladian dynamics. In particular, we establish average-case SQ-hardness for learning output distributions in total variation distance and average-case QPStat-hardness for learning Lindbladian channels in diamond norm. To support these results physically, we derive a linear-response expression for the ensemble-averaged total variation distance and verify the required nonvanishing scaling in a random local amplitude-damping chain. Finally, we design two Lindbladian physically unclonable function (Lindbladian-PUF) protocols based on random Lindbladian ensembles with distribution-level and tomography-based verification, thereby providing open-system examples where learning hardness can be translated into cryptographic security guarantees.</description>

      <title>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</description>

      <title>Quantum information of optical magnetometry: Semiclassical Cramer-Rao bound violation and Heisenberg scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical magnetometers use the rotation of linearly polarized laser light induced by the Faraday effect for high precision magnetic field measurements. Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms.</description>

      <title>Global Parametric Gates for Multi-qubit Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and coherent control errors, with negligible contributions from static ZZ coupling and flux noise. Furthermore, simulations with state-of-the-art parameters predict this global gate can generate high-fidelity (99.70\%) entanglement in systems of up to six qubits.</description>

Abstract: Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Bargmann Invariants: Geometric Foundations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants, a class of gauge-invariant quantities arising from the overlaps of quantum state vectors, provide a profound and unifying framework for understanding the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary equivalence and constructing a complete set of polynomial invariants for mixed states. Furthermore, we explore their pivotal role in modern quantum information science, specifically in developing operational methods for entanglement detection without the need for full state tomography. By synthesizing historical context with recent advances, this survey aims to highlight Bargmann invariants not merely as mathematical curiosities, but as essential instruments for probing the relational and geometric features of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Random-Matrix-Induced Simplicity Bias in Over-parameterized Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pervasive Vulnerability Analysis and Defense for QKD-based Quantum Private Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Private Query (QPQ) based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is among the most practically viable quantum communication protocols, with application value second only to QKD itself. However, prevalent security vulnerabilities in the post-processing stages of most existing QKD-based QPQ protocols have been severely overlooked. This study focuses on hidden information extraction under undetermined signal bits, revealing that most such QPQ protocols face severe security threats even without complex quantum resources. Specifically, direct observation attack causes incremental information leakage, while the minimum error discrimination attack efficiently steals additional database inforamtion. To address these critical flaws, the proposed multi-encryption defense scheme is compatible with existing QPQ protocols. The study demonstrates the necessity of the multi-encryption strategy for the security of databases in QPQ, providing key theoretical and technical support for constructing practical QPQ protocols resistant to real-world attacks.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Unfair Sampling in Quantum Annealing by Node Centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In applications where multiple optimal solutions are needed, transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) is known to sample degenerate ground states in a strongly biased manner. Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning with Noisy Dataset for Rydberg Microwave Sensors Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a self-supervised deep learning framework for Rydberg sensors that enables single-shot noise suppression matching the accuracy of multi-measurement averaging. The framework eliminates the need for clean reference signals (hardly required in quantum sensing) by training on two sets of noisy signals with identical statistical distributions. When evaluated on Rydberg sensing datasets, the framework outperforms wavelet transform and Kalman filtering, achieving a denoising effect equivalent to 10,000-set averaging while reducing computation time by three orders of magnitude. We further validate performance across diverse noise profiles and quantify the complexity-performance trade-off of U-Net and Transformer architectures, providing actionable guidance for optimizing deep learning-based denoising in Rydberg sensor systems.</description>

      <title>On the homogeneity of the quantum transition probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the years 1952 and 1965, H.-C. Wang and U. Hirzebruch showed that the two-point homogeneous compact spaces with convex metrics are isometric to the spheres, the real, complex, octonion projective spaces and the Moufang plane and as well to the sets of the minimal idempotents or pure states in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means. This is an important difference to many other recent approaches that aim to distinguish the entire state spaces among the convex compact sets. An interesting case with non-homogeneous transition probability arises, when the $E_6$-symmetric bioctonionic projective plane is used as quantum logic.</description>

      <title>Discrete symmetries in classical and quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nature of the wave function using the example of a harmonic oscillator. We show that the eigenfunctions $\psi_n{=}z^n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $z\in\mathbb C$ are the coordinates of a classical oscillator with energy $E_n=\hbar\omega n$, $n=0,1,2,...\,$. They are defined on conical spaces ${\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Z}_n$ with cone angles $2\pi/n$, which are embedded as subspaces in the phase space $\mathbb C$ of the classical oscillator. Here ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the finite cyclic group of rotations of the space $\mathbb C$ by an angle $2\pi/n$. The superposition $\psi =\sum_n c_n\psi_n$ of the eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ arises only with incomplete knowledge of the initial data for solving the Schr\"odinger equation, when the conditions of invariance with respect to the discrete groups ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are not imposed and the general solution takes into account all possible initial data parametrized by the numbers $n\in\mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of quantum Zeno dynamics for robust quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), which restricts the system's evolution to a protected subspace, provides a promising approach for protecting quantum information from noise. Here, we explore a practical approach to harnessing QZD for robust quantum metrology. By introducing strong inter-particle interactions during the parameter encoding stage, we overcome the typical limitations of previous QZD studies, which have largely focused on single-particle systems and faced challenges where QZD could interfere with the encoding process. We experimentally validate the proposed scheme on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform, achieving near-optimal precision scaling under amplitude damping in both parallel and sequential settings. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the scalability of the approach and its compatibility with other control techniques for suppressing more general types of noise. These findings highlight QZD as a powerful strategy for noise-resilient quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Continuous Unitary Designs for Universally Robust Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary designs are unitary ensembles that emulate Haar-random unitary statistics. They provide a vital tool for studying quantum randomness and have found broad applications in quantum technologies. However, existing research has focused on discrete ensembles, despite that many physical processes, such as in quantum chaos, thermalization, and control, naturally involve continuous ensembles generated from continuous time-evolution. Here we initial the study of continuous unitary designs, addressing fundamental questions about their construction and practical utility. For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Parallel Quantum Gates via Scalable Subsystem-Optimized Robust Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient implementation of parallel quantum gates is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Absolutely Maximal Contextual Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundational work by Bell led to an interest in understanding non-local correlations that arise from entangled states shared between distinct, spacelike-separated parties, which formed a foundation for the theory of quantum information processing. We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Quantum Software Tools with(in) MLIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilers transform code into action. They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains.
  The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers.
  This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend quantum circuit cutting to heterogeneous registers comprising mixed-dimensional qudits. By decomposing non-local interactions into tensor products of local generalised Gell-Mann matrices, we enable the simulation and execution of high-dimensional circuits on disconnected hardware fragments. We validate this framework on qubit--qutrit ($2$--$3$) interfaces, achieving exact state reconstruction with a Total Variation Distance of 0 within single-precision floating-point tolerance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the memory advantage in an 8-particle, dimension-8 system, reducing memory usage from 128 MB to 64 KB per circuit.</description>

      <title>Optimization of modulation transfer protocol for Rydberg RF receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore theoretically and experimentally the recently demonstrated modulation transfer protocol [D.-A. Trinh, K. V. Adwaith, M. Branco, A. Rouxel, S. Welinski, P. Berger, F. Goldfarb, and F. Bretenaker, Applied Physics Letters 125, 154001 (2024)] aiming at extending the bandwidth of quantum RF receivers based on hot Rydberg atoms. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the coupling beam, which is transformed by the nonlinear response of the atoms into an amplitude modulation of the probe beam. We develop a theoretical model to optimize both the modulation frequency and the modulation amplitude of the coupling beam, thereby maximizing the atomic response. Once optimized, the sensitivity to detuned RF fields of this modulation transfer protocol is compared with that of the conventional protocol. This comparison shows that the new protocol outperforms the usual one as soon as the RF signal to be measured is detuned by more than a few MHz and offers a complementary approach to increase the detection bandwidth. In all cases, the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Framework for Failure-Aware Protocols in Fusion-Based Graph-State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generation of photonic graph states in a linear optics setting where sequential non-deterministic fusion measurements are used to build large graph states out of small linear clusters and develop a framework to optimize the building process using graph theoretic characterizations of fusion networks. We present graph state generation protocols for linear cluster resource states and Type-I/Type-II fusions which are adaptive to fusion failure, that is, they reuse leftover graph states in the remaining building process. To estimate hardware costs, we interpret our protocols as finite Markov processes. This viewpoint allows to cast the expected number of fusion measurements until success as a first passage problem. We then deploy a pipeline of polynomial algorithms to optimize arbitrary graph states, extract fusion networks and find beneficial orderings of fusions with the goal of lowering the corresponding mean first passage times. We evaluate our pipeline for different initial resource states and fusion mechanisms with varying success probabilities. Results show that our strategies can reduce the fusion overhead by several orders of magnitude when compared to simple repeat until success protocols, especially for realistic fusion success probabilities between 50-75 %.</description>

      <title>Efficient Calculation of the Maximal R\'{e}nyi Divergence for a Matrix Product State via Generalized Eigenvalue Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(\rho_{A}\right)+S\left(\rho_{B}\right)-S\left(\rho_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on R\'{e}nyi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal R\'{e}nyi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal R\'enyi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.</description>

      <title>Flux-noise-resilient transmon qubit via a doubly-connected gradiometric design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits are a cornerstone of scalable quantum processors, yet their performance is often degraded by sensitivity to low-frequency flux noise. Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Extreme Reservoir Computing for Phase Classification of Polymer Alloy Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Optical nonlinearity of cold atomic ensemble driven by strong coherent field in a saturation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic analysis and evaluation of the dielectric susceptibility of a dielectric medium consisting of vector-type two-energy-level atoms responding on a weak probe mode when the atoms are driven by a strong coherent field. Each atom, in an environment of others, exists as a quasiparticle further structuring a bulk medium. In a limit of dilute atomic gas, the dynamics of each atom follows the Mollow-type nonlinear excitation regime, and the medium susceptibility collectivizes the individual atomic responses to the probe mode. We outline how the collective dynamics can be interpolated up to a dense medium, and we argue from general positions that in such a medium the optical nonlinearity and, in particular, its parametric part could be significantly magnified by manipulating both the coherent pump and the sample density. That indicates certain limitations for potential capabilities of quantum communication protocols utilizing the entangled photons, created by a parametric process, as a main resource of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation is inherently hybrid, and fast classical manipulation of qubit operators is necessary to ensure scalability in quantum software. We introduce PauliEngine, a high-performance C++ framework that provides efficient primitives for Pauli string multiplication, commutators, symbolic phase tracking, and structural transformations. Built on a binary symplectic representation and optimized bit-wise operations, PauliEngine supports both numerical and symbolic coefficients and is accessible through a Python interface. Runtime benchmarks demonstrate substantial speedups over state-of-the-art implementations. PauliEngine provides a scalable backend for operator-based quantum software tools and simulations.</description>

      <title>A General Class of Functionals for Certifying Quantum Incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum steering, measurement incompatibility, and instrument incompatibility have recently been recognized as unified manifestations of quantum incompatibility. Building on this perspective, we develop a general framework for constructing optimization-free, nonlinear incompatibility witnesses based on convex functionals, valid in arbitrary dimensions. We prove that these witnesses are nontrivial precisely when the underlying functional is non-affine on extremal points (e.g., pure states for ensembles). For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures, thereby outperforming most linear steering inequalities in the pure-state regime. Moreover, the construction extends in full generality to certify measurement and instrument incompatibility, where the witnesses act as genuine incompatibility monotones. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach with two operationally relevant functionals: the Wigner-Yanase skew information and an $\ell_{2}$-type coherence functional.</description>

      <title>Topological Obstructions for Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms: Evidence from MaxCut Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.</description>

      <title>Schwarz maps with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of symmetry of quantum mechanical systems is applied to study the structure and properties of several classes of relevant maps in quantum information theory: CPTP, PPT and Schwarz maps. First, we develop the general structure that equivariant maps $\Phi:\mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ between $C^\ast$-algebras satisfy. Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $\Phi(X^\ast X) \geq \Phi(X)^\ast \Phi(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $\Phi$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\mathrm{PPT} \iff \mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequality tests based on high-dimensional entanglement usually require measurements that can resolve multiple possible outcomes. However, the implementation of high-dimensional multi-outcome measurements is often only emulated via a collection of ``click or no-click'' measurements. This reduction of multi-outcome measurements to binary-outcome measurements opens a loophole in high-dimensional tests Bell inequalities which can be exploited by local hidden variable models [Tavakoli et al., Phys. Rev. A 111, 042433 (2025)]. Here, we close this loophole by using four-dimensional photonic path-mode entanglement and multi-outcome detection. We test both the well-known Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality and a related Bell inequality tailored for maximally entangled states in high-dimension. We observe violations that are large enough to also rule out any quantum model based on entanglement of lower dimension, thereby demonstrating genuinely high-dimensional nonlocality free of the binarisation loophole.</description>

      <title>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Excited States and Finite Temperature Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains, to study excited states, and finite temperature properties. First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, which is defined by the model with power law interaction, keeping only interactions between adjacent spins. We show that the distribution of the absolute value of the couplings is the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. However, the sign of the couplings becomes distributed, and the number of negative couplings increases with temperature $T.$ Next, we derive the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins with power exponent $\alpha$. While the sign of the couplings is found to be distributed, the distribution of the coupling amplitude is given by the strong disorder distribution with finite width $2\alpha,$ with small corrections for $\alpha &gt;2$. Resulting finite temperature properties of both short and power law long ranged spin systems are derived, including the magnetic susceptibility, concurrence and entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Periodically Driving 1D Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in a one-dimensional Ising model subjected to a periodically modulated transverse field. In contrast to sudden quenches, we demonstrate that DQPTs can be induced in two distinct ways. First, when the system remains within a given phase--ferromagnetic (FM) or paramagnetic (PM), a resonant periodic drive can trigger a DQPT when its frequency matches the energy-level transition of the system. The timescale for the transition is governed by the perturbation strength $\lambda'$, the critical mode $k_c$, and its energy gap $\Delta_{k_c}$, following the scaling relation $\tau \propto \sin^{-1}k_c \Delta_{k_c}\lambda'^{-1}$. Second, for drives across the critical point between the FM and PM phases, low frequencies can always induce DQPTs, regardless of resonance. This behavior stems from the degeneracy of the energy-level at the critical point, which ensures that any drive with a frequency lower than the system's intrinsic transition frequency will inevitably excite the system. However, in the high-frequency regime, such excitation will be strongly suppressed, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of DQPTs. This study provides deeper insight into the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Solution for Dissipative Generative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</description>

      <title>Practical Geometric and Quantum Kernel Methods for Predicting Skeletal Muscle Outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a clinically relevant extra-pulmonary manifestation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is closely linked to systemic and airway inflammation. This motivates predictive modelling of muscle outcomes from minimally invasive biomarkers that can be acquired longitudinally. We study a small-sample preclinical dataset comprising 213 animals across two conditions (Sham versus cigarette-smoke exposure), with blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measurements and three continuous targets: tibialis anterior muscle weight (milligram: mg), specific force (millinewton: mN), and a derived muscle quality index (mN per mg). We benchmark tuned classical baselines, geometry-aware symmetric positive definite (SPD) descriptors with Stein divergence, and quantum kernel models designed for low-dimensional tabular data. In the muscle-weight setting, quantum kernel ridge regression using four interpretable inputs (blood C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, bronchoalveolar lavage cellularity, and condition) attains a test root mean squared error of 4.41 mg and coefficient of determination of 0.605, improving over a matched ridge baseline on the same feature set (4.70 mg and 0.553). Geometry-informed Stein-divergence prototype distances yield a smaller but consistent gain in the biomarker-only setting (4.55 mg versus 4.79 mg). Screening-style evaluation, obtained by thresholding the continuous outcome at 0.8 times the training Sham mean, achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of up to 0.90 for detecting low muscle weight. These results indicate that geometric and quantum kernel lifts can provide measurable benefits in low-data, low-feature biomedical prediction problems, while preserving interpretability and transparent model selection.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Is the Conventional Picture of Coherence Time Complete? Dark Matter Recoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local solar gravitational potential forms a basin for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), with discrete energy levels. Even if barely populated, it introduces a new characteristic timescale in DM dynamics. This necessitates a generalization of the notion of coherence time. We find that, at long times, the phenomenon of recoherence emerges, whereby a subcomponent of ULDM exhibits a formally divergent coherence time. The fact that this generalized coherence time can significantly exceed the naive estimate implies an enhanced sensitivity for dark matter searches that accumulate data over extended observation periods.</description>

      <title>Improved decoding algorithms for surface codes under independent bit-flip and phase-flip errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact decoding for the toric code and for planar and rotated surface codes under the standard independent \(X/Z\) noise model, focusing on Separate Minimum Weight (SMW) decoding and Separate Most Likely Coset (SMLC) decoding. For the SMW decoding problem, we show that an \(O(n^{3/2}\log n)\)-time decoder is achievable for surface and toric codes, improving over the \(O(n^{3}\log n)\) worst-case time of the standard approach based on complete decoding graphs. Our approach is based on a local reduction of SMW decoding to the minimum weight perfect matching problem using Fisher gadgets, which preserves planarity for planar and rotated surface codes and genus~\(1\) for the toric code. This reduction enables the use of Lipton--Tarjan planar separator methods and implies that SMW decoding lies in \(\mathrm{NC}\). For SMLC decoding, we show that the planar surface code admits an exact decoder with \(O(n^{3/2})\) algebraic complexity and that the problem lies in \(\mathrm{NC}\), improving over the \(O(n^{2})\) algebraic complexity of Bravyi \emph{et al.} Our approach proceeds via a dual-cycle formulation of coset probabilities and an explicit reduction to planar Pfaffian evaluation using Fisher--Kasteleyn--Temperley constructions. The same complexity measures apply to SMLC decoding of the rotated surface code. For the toric code, we obtain an exact polynomial-time SMLC decoder with \(O(n^{3})\) algebraic complexity. In addition, while the SMLC formulation is motivated by connections to statistical mechanics, we provide a purely algebraic derivation of the underlying duality based on MacWilliams duality and Fourier analysis. Finally, we discuss extensions of the framework to the depolarizing noise model and identify resulting open problems.</description>

      <title>Silicon-on-sapphire metasurfaces generate arrays of dark and bright traps for neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (c-SOS) metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian beam into arrays of complex optical traps, including arrays of optical bottle beams that trap atoms in dark regions interleaved with bright tweezer arrays. The high refractive index and indirect band gap of crystalline silicon makes it possible to design high-resolution near-infrared ($\lambda&gt;700$ nm) metasurfaces that can be manufactured at scale using CMOS-compatible processes. Compared with active components like spatial light modulators (SLMs) that have become widely used to generate trap arrays, metasurfaces provide an indefinitely scalable number of pixels, enabling large arrays of complex traps in a very small form factor, as well as reduced dynamic noise. To design metasurfaces that can generate three-dimensional bottle beams to serve as dark traps, we modified the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to enforce complex-amplitude profiles at the focal plane of the metasurface and to optimize the uniformity of the traps across the array. We fabricated and measured c-SOS metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian laser beam into arrays of bright traps, dark traps, and interleaved bright/dark traps.</description>

      <title>Ground State and Collective Modes of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Newtonian and MOND-inspired gravitational potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the ground state and collective dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in two traps: a Newtonian potential and a logarithmic potential inspired by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In the ground state, the MOND potential supports bound states only in the deep-MOND regime, where the condensate becomes significantly larger than its Newtonian counterpart. The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\beta$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\beta^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $\beta^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit. These scaling laws provide insights for quantum-simulation experiments aiming to probe modified-gravity scenarios with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Soliton Thouless pumping engineered by inter-site nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study soliton Thouless pumping in an extended diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with on-site nonlinearities and inter-site nonlinearities. We show that the inter-site nonlinearities can make solitons acquire anomalous transport distances far beyond the ones predicted by the linear bands, and the quantized displacements can be engineered well. We uncover that nonlinear instabilities require lower limits on sweeping rates for soliton pumping, challenging the common notion that slower modulation enables a more favorable realization of topological transport. The nonlinear interactions between solitons make multi-soliton pumping generally lack the robustness characteristic of Thouless pumping as linear systems. Our results provide many possibilities to engineer topological pumping by nonlinearities, and further make a step for applications of soliton pumping.</description>

      <title>Variation on the theme of Jarzynski's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jarzynski equality, which relates equilibrium free-energy difference to an average of non-equilibrium work, plays a central role in modern non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. In this paper, we study a weaker consequence of this relation, known as Jarzynski's inequality, which can be formally obtained from the Jarzynski equality via Jensen's inequality. We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-Qubit Module Based on Phonon-Coupled Ge Hole-Spin Qubits: Design, Fabrication, and Readout at 1-4 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>High-Order Epistasis Detection Using Factorization Machine with Quadratic Optimization Annealing and MDR-Based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting high-order epistasis is a fundamental challenge in genetic association studies due to the combinatorial explosion of candidate locus combinations. Although multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a widely used method for evaluating epistasis, exhaustive MDR-based searches become computationally infeasible as the number of loci or the interaction order increases. In this paper, we define the epistasis detection problem as a black-box optimization problem and solve it with a factorization machine with quadratic optimization annealing (FMQA). We propose an efficient epistasis detection method based on FMQA, in which the classification error rate (CER) computed by MDR is used as a black-box objective function. Experimental evaluations were conducted using simulated case-control datasets with predefined high-order epistasis. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identified ground-truth epistasis across various interaction orders and the numbers of genetic loci within a limited number of iterations. These results indicate that the proposed method is effective and computationally efficient for high-order epistasis detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report rovibronic spectra of the A $^3\Sigma^+$($v'=0-2$) - X $^3\Pi_\Omega(v=0)$ rovibronic transitions ($|\Omega|=0, 1$ and 2) of the CO$^{2+}$ doubly-charged molecular ion. Spectra were recorded at high resolution ($\sim 5$~cm$^{-1}$) in a fast beam of CO$^{2+}$ molecules by detecting the Coulomb explosion of the molecules upon excitation to the A state. Measurements were guided by \textit{ab initio} calculations which then assisted the assignment of the observed spectral features. Our results resolve the spin-orbit splittings of the ground vibronic state X $^3\Pi_\Omega(v=0)$, but not the rotational structure of the bands due to spectral congestion, and provide spectroscopic information on CO$^{2+}$ with unprecedented resolution. In doing so they expand our knowledge of this benchmark doubly charged molecular ion and expand the short list of doubly charged molecules studied at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Where does what happens happen in a quantum system? The standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics provides a strange, imprecise and yet successful-in-practice answer to this question. In the struggle to unify our understanding of gravity with quantum theory, though, the textbook answer no longer suffices, and an alternative approach is needed. The Feynman Sum Over Histories approach provides an alternative that is particularly suited to quantum gravity because the Sum Over Histories and General Relativity are built on the same fundamental concepts of `event' and `history'.</description>

      <title>Topological States Enabled by Non-local Nonlinearity in Synthetic Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and nonlinearity represents a central challenge in modern physics. Here, we investigate this interplay by considering a synthetic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with all-to-all nonlocal interactions. We find that the distinctive nonlinearity maintains an effective chiral symmetry and leads to a quantized nonlinear winding and Berry phase, as corroborated by the developed Bogoliubov nonlinear adiabatic theory. Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings. Experimentally, our model can be realized using photons in a degenerate optical cavity with Rydberg-mediated interactions. Our results establish a rigorous framework and pave the way for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and their applications in synthetic quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum AI for Cybersecurity: A hybrid Quantum-Classical models for attack path analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cyberattacks are increasingly complex, posing significant challenges to classical machine learning methods, particularly when labeled data is limited and feature interactions are highly non-linear. In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance.</description>

      <title>Exact Mobility Edges in a Disorder-Free Dimerized Stark Lattice with Effective Unbounded Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and Opportunities for Tunable High-Purity Single Photon Emitters: A Review of Hybrid Perovskites and Prospects for Bright Squeezed Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central to quantum communication, computing, and metrology, yet their development remains constrained by trade-offs in purity, indistinguishability, and tunability. This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>A Length-Gauge Origin-Invariant Approach to Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra without Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have extended the origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)) approach -- originally developed by Caricato and co-workers for optical rotation (OR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) -- to vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-{\alpha}-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.</description>

      <title>On the temperature of the quantum black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure. That leaves room for some interesting discussion.</description>

      <title>Improved device-independent randomness expansion rates using two sided randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A device-independent randomness expansion protocol aims to take an initial random string and generate a longer one, where the security of the protocol does not rely on knowing the inner workings of the devices used to run it. In order to do so, the protocol tests that the devices violate a Bell inequality and one then needs to bound the amount of extractable randomness in terms of the observed violation. The entropy accumulation theorem lower bounds the extractable randomness of a protocol with many rounds in terms of the single-round von Neumann entropy of any strategy achieving the observed score. Tight bounds on the von Neumann entropy are known for the one-sided randomness (i.e., where the randomness from only one party is used) when using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game. Here we investigate the possible improvement that could be gained using the two-sided randomness. We generate upper bounds on this randomness by attempting to find the optimal eavesdropping strategy, providing analytic formulae in two cases. We additionally compute lower bounds that outperform previous ones and can be made arbitrarily tight (at the expense of more computation time). These bounds get close to our upper bounds, and hence we conjecture that our upper bounds are tight. We also consider a modified protocol in which the input randomness is recycled. This modified protocol shows the possibility of rate gains of several orders of magnitude based on recent experimental parameters, making device-independent randomness expansion significantly more practical. It also enables the locality loophole to be closed while expanding randomness in a way that typical spot-checking protocols do not.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>

      <title>How to Sign Quantum Messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06325v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signing quantum messages has long been considered impossible even under computational assumptions. In this work, we challenge this notion and provide three innovative approaches to sign quantum messages that are the first to ensure authenticity with public verifiability. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
  1) We introduce the concept of time-dependent (TD) signatures, where the signature of a quantum message depends on the time of signing and the verification process depends on the time of the signature reception. We construct this primitive assuming the existence of post-quantum secure one-way functions (pq-OWFs) and time-lock puzzles (TLPs).
  2) By utilizing verification keys that evolve over time, we eliminate the need for TLPs in our construction. This leads to TD signatures from pq-OWFs with dynamic verification keys.
  3) We then consider the bounded quantum storage model, where adversaries are limited with respect to their quantum memories. We show that quantum messages can be signed with information-theoretic security in this model.
  Moreover, we leverage TD signatures to achieve the following objectives, relying solely on pq-OWFs: (a) We design a public key encryption scheme featuring authenticated quantum public keys that resist adversarial tampering. (b) We present a novel TD public-key quantum money scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from a probability distribution is a core task in many quantum and classical algorithms. Variational quantum circuits provide a natural approach to generating such distributions, as measurement outcomes directly define the probability values. However, designing circuits that train reliably while utilizing limited quantum resources remains largely a heuristic approach. In particular, the roles of expressibility, entanglement capability, and quantum resources in training performance and scalability are not well understood. In this work we present a systematic study of variational quantum circuits where we compare different ansatze family across multiple cost functions and classical optimization methods. We use expressibility and entanglement capability as circuit descriptors to explain convergence behaviors, optimizer sensitivity and robustness to noise. Our results provide a practical guidelines for designing resource aware, efficient and trainable quantum circuits, moving beyond heuristic methods for near term applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum heat transformer (QHT), a quantum thermodynamic device that modulates temperature gradients between two thermal junctions in quantum systems. Functionally, the QHT is analogous to classical absorption heat transformers in its ability to redistribute thermal energy without external work input. Moreover, we show that its performance ratio mirrors that of classical voltage transformers, where the intrinsic parameters of the system play a role similar to the coil turn ratios. We initially design the device for a three-qubit system, representing the smallest possible self-contained heat transformer model. Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode as the primary focus. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by illustrating that a variety of self-contained setups can be constructed, each corresponding to different configurations of the interaction Hamiltonian and their associated self-contained conditions. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical transformers, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for classical transformers.</description>

Abstract: Cycle scenarios are a significant class of contextuality scenarios, with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario being a notable example. While binary outcome measurements in these scenarios are well understood, the generalization to arbitrary outcomes remains less explored, except in specific cases. In this work, we employ homotopical methods in the framework of simplicial distributions to characterize all contextual vertices of the non-signaling polytope corresponding to cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes. Additionally, our techniques utilize the bundle perspective on contextuality and the decomposition of measurement spaces. This enables us to extend beyond scenarios formed by gluing cycle scenarios and describe contextual extremal simplicial distributions in these generalized contexts.</description>

Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing is a promising candidate for quantum computation because it can, even with one mode, utilize infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and can efficiently handle continuous values. Although photonic platforms have been considered as a leading platform for CV computation, hybrid systems that use both qubits and bosonic modes, e.g., superconducting hardware, have shown significant advances because they can prepare non-Gaussian states by utilizing the nonlinear interaction between the qubits and the bosonic modes. However, the size of hybrid hardware is currently restricted. Moreover, the fidelity of the non-Gaussian state is also restricted. This work extends the projective squeezing method to establish a formalism for projecting quantum states onto the states that are unitary-transformed from the squeezed vacuum at the expense of the sampling cost. Based on this formalism, we propose methods for simulating larger quantum devices and projecting states onto the cubic phase state, a typical non-Gaussian state, with a higher squeezing level and higher nonlinearity. To make implementation practical, we can, by leveraging the interactions in hybrid systems of qubits and bosonic modes, apply the smeared projector by using either the linear-combination-of-unitaries or virtual quantum error detection algorithms. We numerically verify the performance of our methods and show that projection can suppress the effect of photon-loss errors.</description>

Abstract: Multi-photon processes deteriorate the quantum non-demolition (QND) character of the dispersive readout in circuit QED, causing readout to lag behind single and two-qubit gates, in both speed and fidelity. Alternative methods such as the longitudinal readout have been proposed, however, it is unknown to what extent multi-photon processes hinder this approach. Here we investigate the QND character of the longitudinal readout of the transmon qubit. We show that the deleterious effects that arise due to multi-photon transitions can be heavily suppressed with detuning, owing to the fact that the longitudinal interaction strength is independent of the transmon-resonator detuning. We consider the effect of circuit disorder, the selection rules that act on the transmon, as well as the description of longitudinal readout in the classical limit of the transmon to show qualitatively that longitudinal readout is robust. We show that fast, high-fidelity QND readout of transmon qubits is possible with longitudinal coupling.</description>

Abstract: Dispersive readout, the standard method for measuring superconducting qubits, is limited by multiphoton qubit-resonator processes arising even at moderate drive powers. These processes degrade performance, causing dispersive readout to lag behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. In this work, we propose a novel readout method, termed "junction readout". Junction readout leverages the nonperturbative cross-Kerr interaction resulting from coupling a qubit and a resonator via a Josephson junction. Furthermore, by adding a capacitive coupling in parallel to the junction, Purcell decay can be suppressed without the need for a Purcell filter. We also show that junction readout is more robust against deleterious multiphoton processes, and offers greater flexibility for resonator frequency allocation. Crucially, junction readout achieves superior performance compared to dispersive readout while maintaining similar hardware overhead. Numerical simulations show that junction readout can achieve fidelities exceeding $99.99\%$ in under $30$ ns, making it a promising alternative for superconducting qubit readout with current hardware.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of quantum information and computational resources using a tractable model of coupled harmonic oscillators. We precisely characterize the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity, demonstrating that they serve as complementary yet distinct measures of quantum correlations. Our analysis reveals how coupling strength, detuning, and external magnetic fields modulate these quantities, with synchronization and mutual information exhibiting marked divergence in nonlinear regimes. By employing exact Gaussian methods, we compute the circuit depth required to prepare target states and connect increased fidelity to more regular dynamical behavior. Furthermore, we analyze single-ion transport in a harmonic trap, comparing sudden and adiabatic protocols. We introduce a nonadiabaticity metric to quantify the fidelity-complexity trade-off, showing that smooth control sequences significantly minimize operational errors by suppressing excitations. These results provide a refined understanding of quantum correlations and offer concrete principles for optimizing control strategies in quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Genovese and Piacentini [Phys.Rev.A 111, 022204 (2025)] claim that in a recent experiment[S.Virz\`i et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 9, 045027 (2024)] the Bell parameter was measured on a single pair of photons thus it challenges several conclusions and discussions on the meaning of Bell inequalities as well as certain QM interpretations. We explain that the parameter measured in Virzi et al. experiment it is not the Bell parameter S which was discussed and estimated in many loophole free tests. Therefore, this experiment neither challenges our understanding of Bell Tests nor allows having doubts about Bohr complementarity and contextuality.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog quantum Rabi simulation in the Deep Strong Coupling Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum Rabi model (QRM) in the deep strong coupling (DSC) regime. To capture the full dynamics of the QRM in the DSC regime, we implemented single-qubit rotations combined with integrated digital steps and qubit-bosonic blocks. This approach leads to a paradigm known as digital analog quantum simulations (DAQSs). In this work, we review the encoding of QRM in the DSC regime through emerging paradigms of digital and analog techniques. Using DAQSs encoding, an efficient simulation can be performed on state-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms. Finally, we provide detailed information on the dynamics of the QRM in varity of parameter regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAQS paradigms in achieving prolonged coherent measurements during time evolution, even in the case of perturbative DSC regime dynamics. This proposal lays the groundwork for simulating complex many-body dynamics that involve bosonic modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum heat machines using a diatomic molecule modelled by a $q$-deformed potential as a working medium. We analyze the effect of the deformation parameter and other potential parameters on the work output and efficiency of the quantum Otto and quantum Carnot heat cycles. Furthermore, we derive the analytical expressions of work and efficiency as a function of these parameters. Interestingly, our system operates as a quantum heat engine across the range of parameters considered. In addition, the efficiency of the quantum Otto heat engine is seen to be tunable by the deformation parameter. Our findings provide useful insight for understanding the impact of anharmonicity on the design of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Automated discovery and optimization of autonomous quantum error correction codes for a general open quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to search for the optimal code space, induced decay rates and control Hamiltonian to implement autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) for a general open quantum system. The system is defined by a free-evolution Lindbladian superoperator, which contains the free Hamiltonian and naturally occurring decoherence terms, as well as the control superoperators. The performance metric for optimization in our algorithm is the fidelity between the projector onto the code space and the same projector after Lindbladian evolution for a specified time. We use a gradient-based search to update the code words, induced decay matrix and control Hamiltonian matrix. We apply our algorithm to optimize AQEC codes for a variety of few-level systems. The four-level system with uniform decay rates offers a simple example for testing and illustrating the operation of our approach. The algorithm reliably succeeds in finding the optimal code in this case, while success becomes probabilistic for more complicated cases. For a five-level system with photon loss decay, the algorithm finds good AQEC codes, but these codes are not as good as the well-known binomial code. We use the binomial code as a starting point to search for the optimal code for a perturbed five-level system. In this case, the algorithm finds a code that is better than both the original binomial code and any other code obtained numerically when starting from a random initial guess. Our results demonstrate the promise of using computational techniques to discover and optimize AQEC codes in future real-world quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity dressing of molecular vibrational dynamics expands the role of characteristic vibrations as spectroscopic markers of underlying ultrafast dynamics. Interacting vibrational modes exhibit a pronounced excited state delocalization due to the interaction with the cavity mode, which is reflected in the ultrafast dynamics. We characterize the ultrafast dynamics of these cavity-dressed characteristic vibrations in the presence of dissipation. Specifically, we present two complementary three-pulse coherent multidimensional spectroscopic techniques capable of monitoring one- and two-quantum cavity-dressed vibrational excitations. Dissipative properties, such as transport and dephasing, are described using a microscopic theory that includes low- and high-energy phonon modes. Simulations were performed with finite laser pulses. The cavity coupling strengths fall within a range similar to vibrational mode couplings, hinting towards a possibility of control of intermolecular vibrational energy redistribution. The framework is extendable to a broad range of cavity-controlled nonlinear spectroscopies of dissipative molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Abelian Quantum Signal Processing: Efficient Control of Hybrid Continuous- and Discrete-Variable Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust quantum control is crucial for achieving operations below the quantum error correction threshold. Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) transforms a unitary parameterized by $\theta$ into one governed by a polynomial function $f(\theta)$, a feature that underpins key quantum algorithms. Originating from composite pulse techniques in NMR, QSP enhances robustness against systematic control errors. We extend QSP to a new class, non-abelian QSP, which utilizes non-commuting control parameters, $\hat\theta_1, \hat\theta_2, \dots$, representing quantum harmonic oscillator positions and momenta. We introduce a fundamental non-abelian composite pulse sequence, the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation (GCR), for entangling and disentangling a qubit from an oscillator. This sequence achieves at least a $4.5\times$ speedup compared to the state-of-the-art abelian QSP pulse BB1, while maintaining performance. Though quantum fluctuations in the control parameters are unavoidable, the richer commutator algebra of non-abelian QSP enhances its power and efficiency. Non-abelian QSP represents the highest tier of QSP variants tailored for hybrid oscillator-qubit architectures, unlocking new possibilities for such systems. We demonstrate the utility of GCR in high-fidelity preparation of continuous-variable oscillator states, including squeezed, Fock, cat, and GKP states, using fully analytical schemes that match numerically optimized methods in fidelity and depth while enabling mid-circuit error detection. Furthermore, we propose a high-fidelity QSP-based end-of-the-line GKP readout and a measurement-free, error-corrected gate teleportation protocol for logical operations on GKP bosonic qudits, bridging the gap between idealized theoretical and experimentally realistic versions of the GKP code. Finally, we showcase a GCR-based phase estimation algorithm for oscillator-based quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Configuration-dependent precision in magnetometry and thermometry using multi-qubit quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the performance of quantum sensors composed of four qubits arranged in different geometries for magnetometry and thermometry. The qubits interact via the transverse-field Ising model with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, maintained in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath under an external magnetic field. Using quantum Fisher information, we evaluate the metrological precision of these sensors. For ferromagnetic couplings, weakly connected graphs (e.g., the chain graph, P_4) perform optimally in estimating weak magnetic fields, whereas highly connected graphs (e.g., the complete graph, K_4) excel at strong fields. Conversely, K_4 achieves the highest sensitivity for temperature estimation in the weak-field regime. In the antiferromagnetic case, we uncover a fundamental trade-off dictated by spectral degeneracy: configurations with non-degenerate energy spectra - such as the pan-like graph (three qubits in a triangle with the fourth attached) - exhibit strong magnetic field sensitivity due to their pronounced response to perturbations. In contrast, symmetric structures like the square graph, featuring degenerate energy levels (particularly ground-state degeneracy), are better suited for precise thermometry. Notably, our four-qubit sensors achieve peak precision in the low-temperature, weak-field regime. Finally, we introduce a spectral sensitivity measure that quantifies energy spectrum deformations under small perturbations, providing a simple heuristic indicator of metrological sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The permutation symmetry is a fundamental attribute of the collective wavefunction of indistinguishable particles. It makes a difference for the behavior of collective systems having different quantum statistics but existing in the same environment. Here we show that for some specific quantum conjugation between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom the indistinguishable particles can behave similarly for either quantum statistics. In particular, a mesoscopically scaled collection of atomic qubits, mediated by optical tweezers, can model the behavior of a valent electronic shell compounded with nuclear centers in molecules. This makes possible quantum simulations of mono and divalent bonds in quantum chemistry by manipulation of up to four bosonic atoms confined with optical microtraps.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the \emph{CP-distance} to quantify the deviation of Hermitian linear maps from complete positivity, defined as the minimal depolarizing noise required to render a map completely positive. We derive a closed spectral formula for this distance and extend the framework to \emph{directional robustness} against arbitrary completely positive maps, establishing stability and tensor-product properties. Expanding this to the intermediate cones of $k$-positive maps, we introduce a \emph{hierarchy of deviation}, $d_k(\Phi)$. We derive a spectral formula for $d_k$ based on entanglement depth and demonstrate that it serves as an optimal threshold for certifying Schmidt numbers, allowing for the universal construction of dimension-sensitive entanglement witnesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Are there consistent and physically reasonable alternatives to the projection postulate? Does it have unique properties compared with acceptable alternatives? We answer these questions by systematically investigating hypothetical state-update rules for quantum systems that nature could have chosen over the L\"uders rule. Among other basic properties, any prospective rule must define unique post-measurement states and not allow for superluminal signalling. Particular attention will be paid to consistently defining post-measurement states when performing local measurements in composite systems. Explicit examples of valid unconventional update rules are presented, each resulting in a distinct, well-defined foil of quantum theory. This framework of state-update rules allows us to identify operational properties that distinguish the projective update rule from all others and to put earlier derivations of the projection postulate into perspective.</description>

Abstract: Metronome synchronization and the transition between the in-phase and anti-phase synchronization have been observed in classical systems. We demonstrate the quantum analog of this phenomenon in a two-qubit system coupled to a common environment. Tracing out the environment in the quantum collision model, we obtain an effective master equation with a two-body dissipator for two qubits. Quenching the two-body dissipator, we demonstrate controlled transitions from in-phase to anti-phase synchronization. This synchronization transition is robust against noise. Signatures of the transition are observed through Pearson correlation coefficient measurements obtained via quantum simulations on superconducting circuits. Future experiments employing qutrit systems are expected to yield a more pronounced effect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum channels are not invertible in general. A quasi-inverse allows for a partial recovery of the input state, but its analytical results are found only in a restricted space of its parameters. This work explores the potential of neural networks to find the quasi-inverse of qubit channels for any values of the channel parameters while keeping the quasi-inverse as a physically realizable quantum operation. We introduce a physics-inspired loss function based on the mean of the square of the modified trace distance (MSMTD). The scaled trace distance is used so that the neural network does not increase the length of the Bloch vector of the quantum states, which ensures that the network behaves as a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) quantum channel. The Kraus operators of the quasi-inverse channel were obtained by performing quantum process tomography on the trained neural network.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for solving generalized eigenvalue problems with application to the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate computation of multiple eigenvalues of quantum Hamiltonians is essential in quantum chemistry, materials science, and molecular spectroscopy. Estimating excited-state energies is challenging for classical algorithms due to exponential scaling with system size, posing an even harder problem than ground-state calculations. We present a quantum algorithm for estimating eigenvalues and singular values of parameterized matrix families, including solving generalized eigenvalue problems that frequently arise in quantum simulations. Our method uses quantum amplitude amplification and phase estimation to identify matrix eigenvalues by locating minima in the singular value spectrum. We demonstrate our algorithm by proposing a quantum-computing formulation of the pseudospectral collocation method for the Schr\"odinger equation. We estimate fault-tolerant quantum resource requirements for the quantum collocation method, showing favorable scaling in the size of the problem $N$ (up to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{N})$) compared to classical implementations with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, for certain well-behaved potentials. Additionally, unlike the standard collocation method, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem requiring matrix inversion, our algorithm circumvents the associated numerical instability by scanning a parameterized matrix family and detecting eigenvalues through singular value minimization. This approach is particularly effective when multiple eigenvalues are needed or when the generalized eigenvalue problem involves a high condition number. In the fault-tolerant era, our method may thus be useful for simulating high-dimensional molecular systems with dense spectra involving highly excited states, such as those encountered in molecular photodynamics or quasi-continuum regimes in many-body and solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Quantum Copying: an adaptive ancillary systems and its limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel state-dependent quantum cloning (copying) process by introducing a new class of ancillary system -- an adaptive ancilla -- modifying the conventional state-dependent quantum copying process. This state-dependent ancillary system is not pre-engineered to match the quantum state to be cloned; rather, it dynamically aligns with the quantum state to be cloned via interaction. However, the space of states that it can clone is restricted by the symmetry principles. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying via an adaptive ancilla. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, contains implicit structural information about the quantum state in the form of a structured set of dynamical response channels. We reinterpret the excited atomic state as a realization of an adaptive ancilla, and cloning of a photon polarization state occurs when the quantum state of an excited atom dynamically aligns with the polarization state of the photon through physical interaction. We demonstrate that the true limits of cloning arise solely not from the no-cloning theorem, but from the symmetries imposed on physical systems\textthreequartersemdash constraints which may, in principle, be relaxed or engineered in suitable quantum systems, for instance in Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing hardware-efficient implementations of quantum algorithms is crucial in the NISQ era to achieve practical quantum advantage. Here, we construct a generic quantum solver for NP problems based on Grover's search algorithm, specifically tailored for Rydberg-atom quantum computing platforms. We design the quantum oracles in the search algorithm using parallelizable single-qubit and multi-qubit entangling gates in the Rydberg atom system, yielding a unified framework for solving a broad class of NP problems with provable quadratic quantum speedup. We analyze the experimental resource requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using Rydberg atomic systems. Our construction indicates that atomic qubits offer favorable circuit depth scaling compared to quantum processors with fixed local connectivity.</description>

Abstract: We analytically investigate the robustness of the Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm in the presence of bit flip, phase flip, and depolarizing noise using the density matrix formalism. We derive the exact expressions for the algorithm's success probability as a function of the error probability $\boldsymbol{p}$ and number of qubits $\boldsymbol{n}$. The analysis compares the three noise models and reveals how performance degrades with increasing system size under standard Pauli noise models. Most importantly, we show that scaling up quantum systems without simultaneously improving qubit quality leads to a sharp decline in ideal quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for Matrix-Product Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</description>

Abstract: Entangled basis measurements play a crucial role in distributing quantum entanglement between parties across a quantum network. In this work, we adopt a semi-device-independent approach that enables the self-testing of n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) basis measurements without requiring shared entanglement between distant parties. Our method relies solely on input-output statistics from a communication scenario involving n spatially separated senders, each receiving two bits of input, and a single receiver with no input. We analyze the robustness of the proposed self-testing protocol. Additionally, we introduce a protocol for robust self-testing of the three-outcome partial Bell basis measurement that is easily implementable in an optical setup.</description>

Abstract: The emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has shown promising advantages in accelerating processing speed and effectively handling the high dimensionality associated with complex datasets. Quantum Computing (QC) enables more efficient data manipulation through the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement. In this paper, we present a novel approach combining quantum and classical machine learning techniques to explore the impact of quantum properties for anomaly detection in Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We compare the performance of a Hybrid-Fully Connected Quantum Neural Network (H-FQNN) with different loss functions and use a publicly available ADS-B dataset to evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate competitive performance in detecting anomalies, with accuracies ranging from 90.17% to 94.05%, comparable to the performance of a traditional Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) model, which achieved accuracies between 91.50% and 93.37%.</description>

Abstract: Quantum measurements play a fundamental role in quantum information. Therefore, increasing efforts are being made to construct symmetric measurement operators for qudit systems. A wide class of projective measurements corresponds to complex projective 2-designs, which include symmetric, informationally complete (SIC) POVMs and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). In this paper, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between conical 2-designs and mutually unbiased generalized equiangular tight frames, both of which are common generalizations of SIC POVMs and MUBs to operators of arbitrary rank. It turns out that there exist rich families of operators that belong to only one of those two classes. This raises important questions about which symmetries have to be preserved for applicational prominence.</description>

Abstract: Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information is to approximate a pure quantum state in terms of sparse states or, for a bipartite system, states of bounded Schmidt rank. The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement across spatially separated network nodes is conventionally established through the distribution of photons from a common source or via entanglement swapping that relies on Bell-state measurements and pre-shared entanglement. Path identity, where the emission origins of photons from different sources are made indistinguishable, offers an alternative route. We show that this mechanism enables complex multipartite, high-dimensional, and even logical entanglement between remote nodes whose photons never interacted. Our schemes require neither direct photon interaction, pre-shared entanglement, nor Bell-state measurements, highlighting a distinct resource for distributed quantum communication and computation. All of the solutions were discovered automatically using highly efficient computational design tools, indicating the potential for scientific inspiration from computational algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method is a promising approach for large-scale quantum chemical calculations on currently available quantum hardware. However, its naive implementation lacks size consistency, which is essential for accurate intermolecular interaction energy calculations using the supramolecular approach. Here, we present a size-consistent implementation of QSCI by sampling Slater determinants for the dimer in the localized molecular orbital basis, constructing the subspaces for the monomers and dimer, and augmenting the dimer subspace with additional determinants required for size consistency. Implemented within the Hamiltonian simulation-based QSCI (HSB-QSCI) framework, our method numerically satisfies size consistency for 4H/8H/12H clusters, the FH dimer, and the FH--H$_2$O system. Application to intermolecular interaction energy calculations of hydrogen-bonded FH dimer and FH--H$_2$O demonstrates that our approach reproduces complete active space-configuration interaction (CAS-CI) values with errors below 0.04 kcal mol$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Quantum State Tomography</title>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling of the cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), an algorithmic framework for sparse signal recovery, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large sparse recovery problems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction error by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation. Our work advances the state of low-rank QST and may be applicable to other quantum tomography protocols.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Generalized Density Functional Theories</title>

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is an indispensable ab initio method in both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. Within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems.</description>

      <title>An introductory review of the theory of continuous-variable quantum key distribution: Fundamentals, protocols, and security</title>

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising approach for secure quantum communication, offering advantages such as high key generation rates, compatibility with standard telecommunication infrastructure, and potential for integration on photonic chips. This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum control over non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current studies of non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems heavily revolved around the singularities in the eigen-spectrum by mimicking their discrete-variable counterparts. The growing discussions over the nonunitary features in time evolution, however, are limited in scalability and controllability. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes under the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Far beyond the subspace of few excitations, our control theory operates in the full Hilbert space within the Heisenberg framework and exploits the gauge potential underlying the instantaneous frames rather than the eigen-spectrum. In particular, the instantaneous frames are defined by time-dependent ancillary operators as linear combinations of laboratory-frame operators; while the associated gauge potential arises from the unitary transformation connecting the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. We find that the upper triangularization condition of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame gives rise to nonadiabatic passages of two time-dependent ancillary operators, also leading to exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. At the end of these passages, the probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be automatically restored without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to both parity-time symmetry of the coefficient matrix and exceptional points of eigen-spectrum; and the latter is consistent with the coherent perfect absorbtion. We essentially constructs the universal quantum control (UQC) theory for the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, promising a powerful and reliable approach for their coherent control.</description>

Abstract: This is a re-editing, which takes quantum mechanics into account, of Wittgenstein's famous Tractatus. The operation has a playful side in the form, but is a serious attempt to capture possible philosophical implications of the Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and formalize the naturalistic third-way between realism and instrumentalism explored by this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Contextuality and quantum discord"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a paper, Al-Qasimi [Physics Letters A 449 (2022) 128347] proposed a criterion for contextuality of two-qubit systems extending Peres' proof of contextuality [Phys. Lett. A 151 (1990) 107]. Using this criterion, Al-Qasimi argued that certain discordant states can be contextual even if they are not entangled. Here I demonstrate that Al-Qasimi's criterion does not, in general, imply contextuality of two-qubit system. However, I point out that Al-Qasimi's criterion is related to a different notion of operational nonclassicality of discordant feature, which is inequivalent to contextuality. This nonclassicality beyond contextuality has been formalized in C. Jebarathinam and R. Srikanth [Int. J. Quantum Inf. 23 (2025) 2550037]. Identifying Al-Qasimi's criterion as demonstration of quantum correlation beyond contextuality, it then follows that Al-Qasimi's main conclusion that one cannot equate quantum correlation and discordant feature is made precise.</description>

      <title>A Time-Symmetric Variational Formulation of Quantum Mechanics: Schr\"odinger Dynamics from Boundary-Driven Indeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard quantum mechanics requires two incompatible dynamical principles: unitary evolution and measurement collapse. We present a variational framework that replaces this dualism with a single principle, in which Schr\"odinger dynamics are not postulated but arise as the unique solution to a two-time boundary value problem. By expressing the state in terms of hydrodynamic variables $(\rho, \mathbf{j})$ subject to a continuity constraint, we show that a Fisher-information regularization term necessitates the standard Schr\"odinger equation as an optimality condition. Crucially, this formulation inverts the standard causal logic: rather than evolving an initial state forward, the dynamics arise from the minimization of a global action connecting imperfectly specified initial and final boundary constraints. Consequently, the boundary conditions act as the active selectors of the trajectory, selecting a specific hydrodynamic flow from an ensemble of admissible histories. Unlike standard Bohmian mechanics, which Landsman [Foundations of Physics 52, 73 (2022)] has shown requires an external "random oracle" to generate Kolmogorov-random outcome sequences, our framework reframes this oracle problem by accounting for effective randomness through the interplay between boundary uncertainty and global constraint satisfaction. We show that the Born rule emerges naturally as a consistency condition for the closure of the primal-dual equations, where the Fisher penalty acts as an information cost that suppresses simple, differentiable trajectories in favor of complex flows whose coarse-grained statistics effectively mimic stochasticity.</description>

      <title>A fast and exact approach for stabilizer R\'enyi entropy via the XOR-FWHT algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum advantage is widely understood to rely on key quantum resources beyond entanglement, among which nonstabilizerness (quantum ``magic'') plays a central role in enabling universal quantum computation. However, a direct brute-force enumeration of all Pauli strings and the corresponding expectation values from a length-$2^N$ state vector, where $N$ is the system size, yields an overall computational cost scaling as $O(8^N)$, which quickly becomes infeasible as the system size grows. Here we reformulate the second-order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in a bitstring language, expose an underlying XOR-convolution structure on $\mathbb Z_2^N$, and reduce the computation to $2^N$ fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms of length, together with pointwise operations, yielding a deterministic and exact XOR fast Walsh-Hadamard transforms algorithm with runtime scaling $O(N4^N)$ and natural parallelism. This algorithm enables high-precision, medium-scale exact calculations for generic state vectors. It provides a practical tool for probing the scaling, phase diagnostics, and dynamical fine structure of quantum magic in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pauli stabilizer formalism for topological quantum field theories and generalized statistics</title>

Abstract: Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) provides a unifying framework for describing topological phases of matter and for constructing quantum error-correcting codes, playing a central role across high-energy physics, condensed matter, and quantum information. A central challenge is to formulate topological order on lattices and to extract the properties of topological excitations from microscopic Hamiltonians. In this work, we construct new classes of lattice gauge theories as Pauli stabilizer models, realizing a wide range of TQFTs in general dimensions. We develop a lattice description of extended excitations and systematically determine their generalized statistics. Our main example is the (4+1)D fermionic-loop toric code, obtained by condensing the $e^2m^2$-loop in the (4+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_4$ toric code. We show that the loop excitation exhibits fermionic loop statistics: the 24-step loop-flipping process yields a phase of $-1$. Our Pauli stabilizer models realize all twisted 2-form gauge theories in (4+1)D, the higher-form Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT classified by $H^5(B^2G,U(1))$. Beyond (4+1)D, the fermionic-loop toric codes form a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in arbitrary dimensions, realized as explicit Pauli stabilizer codes using $\mathbb{Z}_4$ qudits. Finally, we develop a Pauli-based framework that defines generalized statistics for extended excitations in any dimension, yielding computable lattice unitary processes to detect nontrivial statistics. For example, we propose anyonic membrane statistics in (6+1)D, as well as fermionic membrane and volume statistics in arbitrary dimensions. We construct new families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders: the fermionic-membrane toric code and the fermionic-volume toric code. In addition, we demonstrate that $p$-dimensional excitations in $2p+2$ spatial dimensions can support anyonic $p$-brane statistics for only even $p$.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum criticality and pseudocriticality across the fixed-point annihilation in the anisotropic spin-boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-boson models are simple examples of quantum dissipative systems, but also serve as effective models in quantum magnetism and exhibit nontrivial criticality. Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\propto \omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\alpha_i$, $i\in\{x,y,z\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\alpha_z = \alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s&lt;1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent. We also study the crossover away from the SU(2)-symmetric case and determine the phase boundary of an extended U(1)-symmetric critical phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric properties of quantum states are crucial for understanding many physical phenomena in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and optics. The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on a general connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by generalized Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor that contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry. This work sets the stage for further exploration of quantum systems in curved geometries, with applications in both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying 3641 job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms. However, there are signs that change may be forthcoming, indicated by a strong presence of Bachelor's and Master's graduates in the workforce.</description>

      <title>Categorifying Clifford QCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference in Two-Atom Resonant X-ray Scattering of an Intense Attosecond Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate resonant x-ray scattering from two non-interacting Ne+ ions driven by an intense attosecond pulse using a non-relativistic, QED-based time-dependent framework. Our model includes Rabi oscillations, photoionization, Auger decay, and quantum interference among elastic scattering and resonance fluorescence pathways. We analyze how the total scattering signal depends on pulse intensity, atomic configuration, and initial electronic state. We find that the total resonant scattering yield exceeds its non-resonant counterpart; the angular dependence of the signal qualitatively resembles a two-atom structure factor; and the visibility of interference fringes is sensitive to pulse area and the initial electronic state. Only a subset of final states reached via resonance fluorescence exhibits interference, determined by the indistinguishability of photon emission pathways. Fringe visibility is maximized in the linear scattering regime, where ionization is minimal and resonance fluorescence pathways can be largely indistinguishable. These results highlight optimal conditions for applying ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering to single-particle imaging.</description>

      <title>Invariance of quantum scattering rate coefficients to anisotropy of atom-molecule interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum scattering calculations for strongly interacting molecular systems are computationally demanding due to the large number of molecular states coupled by the anisotropy of atom - molecule interactions. We demonstrate that thermal rate coefficients for total (elastic + inelastic) atom - molecule scattering are insensitive to the interaction anisotropy of the underlying potential energy surface. In particular, we show that the rate coefficients for Rb-H$_2$ and Rb-N$_2$ scattering at room temperature can be computed to 1% accuracy with anisotropy set to zero, reducing the complexity of coupled channel quantum scattering calculations to numerical solutions of a single differential equation. Our numerical calculations and statistical analysis based on Gaussian process regression elucidate the origin and limitations of the invariance of the total scattering rate coefficients to changes in atom - molecule interaction anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Correlation Signal from Multipartite Entanglement of Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a signal $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ for genuine tripartite entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum systems and $\Delta^{(3)}_w$ for holographic systems. We prove that $\Delta^{(3)}_p$ is non-negative for any tripartite entangled mixed states. Based on the conjecture, the equality between an entanglement wedge cross section $E_w$ and entanglement of purification $E_p$, i.e., $E_w = E_P$ in the semiclassical limit, we apply the tripartite entanglement measure to study the structures of tripartite entanglement in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, especially for pure AdS$_3$. We comment on a generalization to $n$-partite entanglement signals $\Delta^{(n)}_p(A_1:\cdots:A_n)$.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its central role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd R\'enyi entropy term is available~\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the R\'enyi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability and ergodic properties of quantum trajectories under imperfect measurement, extending previous results established for the ideal case of perfect measurement. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimated trajectory, initialized from an estimated state, to the true trajectory. This result is obtained assuming that the associated quantum channel is irreducible. Building on this, we prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure and demonstrate convergence toward this measure.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of an electron gas in the mean-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the momentum distribution of an electron gas in a $3$-dimensional torus. The goal is to compute the occupation number of Fourier modes for some trial state obtained through random phase approximation. We obtain the mean-field analogue of momentum distribution formulas for electron gas in [Daniel and Voskov, Phys. Rev. \textbf{120}, (1960)] in high density limit and [Lam, Phys. Rev. \textbf{3}, (1971)] at metallic density. The analysis in the present paper is majorly based on the work [Christiansen, Hainzl, Nam, Comm. Math. Phys. \textbf{401}, (2023)]. Our findings are related to recent results obtained independently by Benedikter, Lill and Naidu, and the analysis applies to a general class of singular potentials rather than just the Coulomb case.</description>
