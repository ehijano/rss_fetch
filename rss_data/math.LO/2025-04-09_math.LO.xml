      <title>Toeplitz subshifts of finite rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study some basic problems about Toeplitz subshifts of finite topological rank. We define the notion of a strong Toeplitz subshift of finite rank $K$ by combining the characterizations of Toeplitz-ness and of finite topological rank $K$ from the point of view of the Bratteli--Vershik representation or from the $\mathcal{S}$-adic point of view. The characterization problem asks if for every $K\geq 2$, every Toeplitz subshift of topological rank $K$ is a strong Toeplitz subshift of rank $K$. We give a negative answer to the characterization problem by constructing a Toeplitz subshift of topological rank $2$ which fails to be a strong Toeplitz subshift of rank $2$. However, we show that the set of all strong Toeplitz subshifts of finite rank is generic in the space of all infinite minimal subshifts. In the second part we consider several classification problems for Toeplitz subshifts of topological rank $2$ from the point of view of descriptive set theory. We completely determine the complexity of the conjugacy problem, the flip conjugacy problem, and the bi-factor problem by showing that, as equivalence relations, they are hyperfinite and not smooth. We also consider the inverse problem for all Toeplitz subshifts. We give a criterion for when a Toeplitz subshift is conjugate to its own inverse, and use it to show that the set of all such Toeplitz subshifts is a meager set in the space of all infinite minimal subshifts. Finally, we show that the automorphism group of any Toeplitz subshift of finite rank is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}\oplus C$ for some finite cyclic group $C$, and for every nontrivial finite cyclic group $C$, $\mathbb{Z}\oplus C$ can be realized as the isomorphism type of an automorphism group of a strong Toeplitz subshift of finite rank greater than $2$.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>Indivisibility for Classes of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine indivisibility for classes of graphs. We show that the class of hereditarily $\alpha$-sparse graphs is indivisible if and only if $\alpha &gt; 2$. Additionally, we show that the following classes of graphs are indivisible: perfect graphs, cographs, and chordal graphs, and the following classes of graphs are not indivisible: threshold graphs, split graphs, and distance-hereditary graphs.</description>

      <title>A complete classification of the zero-dimensional homogeneous spaces under determinacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All spaces are assumed to be separable and metrizable. We give a complete classification of the zero-dimensional homogeneous spaces, under the Axiom of Determinacy. This classification is expressed in terms of topological complexity (in the sense of Wadge theory) and Baire category. In the same spirit, we also give a complete classification of the filters on $\omega$ up to homeomorphism. As byproducts, we obtain purely topological characterizations of the semifilters and filters on $\omega$. The Borel versions of these results are in almost all cases due to Fons van Engelen. Along the way, we obtain Wadge-theoretic results of independent interest, especially regarding closure properties.</description>

      <title>Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>
