      <title>Spectrality of Product Sets with a Perturbed Interval Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be spectral if $L^2(\Omega)$ admits an orthogonal basis of exponentials. While the product of spectral sets is known to be spectral, the converse fails in general. In this paper, we prove that the converse holds when one factor is a perturbation of an interval: if $E \subset [0,3/2 - \epsilon]$ and $F$ are bounded sets of measure $1$, then $E \times F$ is spectral if and only if both $E$ and $F$ are spectral.</description>

      <title>Hyperasymptotics for linear difference equations with an irregular singularity of rank one: Polynomial coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperasymptotics is an analytical method that incorporates exponentially small contributions into asymptotic approximations, thereby expanding their domain of validity, improving accuracy, and providing deeper insight into the underlying singularity structures. It also allows for the computation of problem-specific invariants, such as Stokes multipliers, whose values are often assumed or remain unknown in other approaches. For differential equations, unlike standard asymptotic expansions, hyperasymptotic expansions determine solutions uniquely. In this paper, we extend the hyperasymptotic method to inverse factorial series solutions of certain higher-order linear difference equations and demonstrate that the resulting expansions also determine the solutions uniquely. We further indicate how the connection coefficients appearing in these expansions can be computed numerically using hyperasymptotic techniques. In addition, we give explicit remainder bounds for the inverse factorial series solutions. Our main tool is the Mellin--Borel transform. The expansions are expressed via universal hyperterminant functions, closely related to the hyperterminants familiar from integral and differential equation contexts. The results are illustrated by the Gauss hypergeometric function with a large third parameter and a third-order difference equation.</description>

      <title>$\zeta$-functions via contour integrals and universal sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops an analytic framework for the study of the $\zeta$-function associated with general sequences of complex numbers. We show that a contour integral representation, commonly used when studying spectral $\zeta$-functions associated with self-adjoint differential operators, can be extended far beyond its traditional setting. In contrast to representations utilizing integrals of $\theta$-functions, our method applies to arbitrary sequences of complex numbers with minimal assumptions. This leads to a set of universal identities, including sum rules and meromorphic properties, that hold across a broad class of $\zeta$-functions. Additionally, we discuss the connection to regularized (modified) Fredholm determinants of $p$-Schatten--von Neumann class operators. We illustrate the versatility of this representation by computing special values and residues of the $\zeta$-function for a variety of sequences of complex numbers, in particular, the zeros of Airy functions, parabolic cylinder functions, and confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we employ the adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational interpolation in the study of the Airy $\zeta$-function.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Widom factors for orthogonal and residual polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Widom factors for (a) monic orthogonal polynomials in $L^2$ with respect to the equilibrium measure of a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}$ and (b) residual polynomials normalized at an exterior point. Using weakly equilibrium Cantor sets $K(\gamma)$, we prove:
  (1) Given any sequence $(c_n)$ with subexponential growth, there exists a non-polar Cantor set $K(\gamma)$, depending on $(c_n)$, such that the $L^2$ Widom factors of the associated orthogonal polynomials (with respect to the equilibrium measure of $K(\gamma)$) exceed $c_n$ for every $n$.
  (2) For the same $K(\gamma)$ built from $(c_n)$ and each exterior point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}\setminus K(\gamma)$, the residual Widom factors satisfy power-type lower bounds with a Harnack-distance exponent $\tau_{x_0}\in(0,1)$: they are bounded below by $c_n^{\tau_{x_0}}$ for all degrees when $x_0$ lies in an unbounded gap, and along a subsequence of degrees when $x_0$ lies in a bounded gap. Consequently, if, in addition, $(c_n)$ is monotone increasing and unbounded, then the sequence of residual Widom factors is unbounded for every $x_0\in\mathbb{R}\setminus K(\gamma)$.
  The proofs combine inverse-image constructions, capacity comparisons for period-$n$ sets, harmonic-measure representations for differences of Green functions, and alternation principles on nested approximants.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Campanato Spaces: Duality and Calder\'on--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\in(0,\infty)$, $q\in[1,\infty)$, $s\in\mathbb Z_+$, and $W$ be an $A_p$-matrix weight, which in the scalar case is exactly a Muckenhoupt $A_{\max\{1,p\}}$ weight. In this article, by using the reducing operators of $W$, we introduce matrix-weighted Campanato spaces $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$. When $p\in(0,1]$, applying the atomic and the finite atomic characterizations of the matrix-weighted Hardy space $H^p_W$, we prove that the dual space of $H^p_W$ is precisely $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$, which further induces several equivalent characterizations of $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$. In addition, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of modified Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$ with $p\in(0,\infty)$, which, combined with the duality, further gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $H^p_W$ with $p\in(0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in a Slow-Fast Paleoclimate Model for Glacial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a deterministic variant of the Saltzman-Maasch model for Pleistocene glacial cycles, formulated as a three-dimensional dynamical system with cubic feedback in the atmospheric carbon dioxide equation. After reducing the model to a planar system on a critical manifold, we perform a detailed bifurcation analysis and identify both Hopf and Bautin (generalized Hopf) bifurcations, which govern the emergence of stable and unstable limit cycles. To analyze global transitions, we perform a rescaling of time and variables to derive a leading-order Hamiltonian system. This reduction enables the explicit construction of homoclinic orbits and the application of Melnikov's method to assess their persistence under perturbations. The analytical findings are further corroborated by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the differentiability of the conjugacy in a nonautonomous version of the Hartman--Grobman Theorem for systems with finite delay, where the linear part satisfies a $\mu$-dichotomy. Under suitable conditions on the nonlinear perturbation, the conjugacy is shown to be a $C^{1}$ diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Mittag-Leffler functions in the Fourier space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and let $\beta&gt;0$. Fix $-\pi&lt;\varphi\leq \pi$ such that $|\varphi|&gt;\alpha \pi/2$. We determine the precise asymptotic behaviour of the Fourier transform of $E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath} \varphi} |\cdot|^{\sigma})$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$\!, whenever $\sigma&gt;(n-1)/2$. Remarkably, this asymptotic behaviour turns out to be independent of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\phi$ in the aforedescribed range. This helps us determine the values of the Lebesgue exponent $p=p(\sigma)$, $\sigma&gt;(n-1)/2$, for which $\mathcal{F} \left(E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath} \varphi} |\cdot|^{\sigma})\right)$ is in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. Such values cannot be obtained via the Hausdorff-Young inequality. This problem arises in the study of space-time fractional equations. Our approach provides an effective alternative to the asymptotic analysis of the Fox $H-$ functions recently applied to the cases $\alpha \in (0,1)$, $\beta=\alpha$ with $\varphi=-\pi/2$, and $\beta=1$ with $\varphi=\pi$. We rather rely on an appropriate integral representative of $E_{\alpha,\beta}$, and an extended asymptotic expansion for the Bessel function whose coefficients and remainder term are obtained explicitly.</description>

      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>

Abstract: We systematically exploit a new generalized hypergeometric identity to obtain new hypergeometric summation formulas. As a consistency test, alternative proofs for some special cases are also provided. As a byproduct new summation formulas involving finite sums involving the psi function, or a recursive formula for the Bateman's G function are derived.

      <title>Critical scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on waveguide manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on waveguide manifolds. Our work is primarily inspired by the recent paper of Kwak and Kwon \cite{KwakKwon} that established the local well-posedness of the periodic NLS with possibly non-algebraic nonlinearity. While we adopt a framework similar to \cite{KwakKwon} for our problem, two main obstacles prevent its direct adaptation to the waveguide setting. First, the classical Strichartz estimates for NLS in critical product spaces, introduced by Hani and Pausader, possess limited endpoints and are thus inapplicable to high-dimensional waveguides. Second, the crucial fractional arguments used in \cite{KwakKwon} rely on a well-known fractional derivative formula due to Strichartz, which admits only a Hilbert space-valued extension and is therefore incompatible with our model setting.
  To overcome these difficulties, we develop an anisotropic generalization of the framework in \cite{KwakKwon} using the anisotropic Strichartz estimates established by Tzvetkov and Visciglia, which allow for nearly unlimited endpoints. We also resolve several new challenges arising from the vector-valued and anisotropic nature of the model by employing novel interpolation techniques within Besov spaces. As a further novelty, we provide a new proof of the main result based on classical fixed point arguments, differing from the approximation methods used in \cite{KwakKwon}. Consequently, we settle the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the NLS with arbitrary mass-supercritical nonlinearity on waveguide manifolds.</description>
