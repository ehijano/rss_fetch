      <title>Comparative Analysis of Electron Acceleration by Laser Pulse in Flat and Chip Dielectric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative analysis of two types of dielectric laser accelerators (DLA) based on periodic (grating) and flat dielectric structures to accelerate electrons in the energy range from 300 keV to 3 GeV is presented. The main attention is paid to the conditions, efficiency and restrictions of each acceleration method, as well as the influence of laser radiation parameters on electron acceleration processes. Single and double (both grating and flat) dielectric structures and their impact on acceleration are considered. For the study of two types of quartz DLA, the Ti:Sa laser system with a generation band width 790-810 nm (FWHM), the laser electric field 6 GeV/m are used. The study showed that a flat dielectric structure provides more effective acceleration in a wide range of energies, especially with a symmetrical geometry (double structures), compared with the periodic structure. If we consider only a periodic structure, then with the selected symmetrical geometry, for the ultra relativistic electrons, it demonstrates the acceleration rate two times of magnitude more than for single configuration. However, the use of a one-sided periodic structure turns out to be preferable for accelerating electrons with moderate energies, ~0.5-0.9 MeV, where the acceleration rate in a one-sided configuration is higher than in a symmetric (double) periodic structure. The space-time distributions of laser-excited electromagnetic fields in the accelerating channel and their influence on the electron beam is analyzed also. The advantage of a flat structure over a periodic one, which arises due to the design features of the corresponding dielectric accelerators, is discussed.</description>

      <title>H$^-$ low energy beam irradiation and high field pulsing tests in different metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the suitability of a set of different materials for manufacturing of more efficient and durable Radio-Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) structures compared to that currently used in many linear particle accelerators, traditionally made out of copper. RFQs are susceptible to vacuum breakdowns caused by the exposure to high electric fields, resulting in surface degradation. Additionally, a further limitation of present-day copper RFQs is surface blistering under hydrogen ion beam exposure, due to beam halo losses. Irradiation is associated with a further reduction of the breakdown field strength of the metal surface thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the RFQ. The investigated materials, Cu-OFE, CuCr1Zr, CuBe2, Ti6Al4V, SS316LN, Nb and Ta, were submitted to low-energy (45 keV) H$^-$ irradiation and tested in a direct-current (DC) system with pulsed high voltage. For comparison, the maximum surface electric field was measured for both irradiated and pristine (non irradiated) surfaces of the same material. The effects of irradiation on the surface of the materials, before and after being submitted to high electric fields, were studied with the help of microscopic imaging and chemical analysis. Blistering caused by H$^-$ irradiation has been observed in all copper and copper alloy materials. Despite reductions in breakdown field strength post-irradiation, no indications were found that the blisters on the surface have a direct cause in triggering breakdowns during high electric field tests. SS316LN, Ti6Al4V, CuBe2 and CuCr1Zr showed maximum surface electric fields higher than copper, making these promising candidate materials for future RFQs manufacturing. This paper focuses on the results with CuCr1Zr, CuBe2, SS316LN and Ta, complementing and expanding previous work exploring Cu-OFE, Nb and Ti6Al4V.</description>

      <title>Error Determination in Sextupole Magnet Calibration and Alignment Measurements and Application to Horizontal Beam Size Calculations at the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on measurements and modeling studies performed from 2021 to 2024 on the 76 sextupole magnets in the Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring CESR. Beam-based, magnet-specific calibrations ($K_2$ value versus excitation current) were measured. It was found that the new calibrations differ from those previously in use by an average of 3.1% with an RMS spread of 12%. The uncertainties in the calibration correction factors average 1.7% with an RMS spread of 1.0%.
  Sextupole alignment values relative to the reference orbit were measured by combining the measured beam position with the quadrupole and skew quadrupole terms caused by a sextupole strength change $\Delta K_2$. High accuracy was achieved by fitting to difference phase and coupling functions as $K_2$ was varied. The horizontal (vertical) average offset values were found to be -0.01 (0.03)~mm with RMS spread of 1.1 (0.9)~mm with some exceptionally large values of a few millimeters. Typical uncertainties are 0.01-0.02~mm.
  The above measurements were motivated by the precision required in measuring horizontal beam size at each sextupole. A precision of 10\% for a \mbox{1-mm} beam size requires uncertainties of better than 0.1~$\mu$radian in the horizontal angle change produced in the sextupole for a typical strength change of \mbox{$\Delta K_2 \, L$ = 1 m$^{-2}$}, where $L$ is the length of the sextupole, as well as 10\% in the difference of the squared horizontal and vertical beam positions relative to the center of the sextupole. These precision values were achieved by the analysis of difference functions. However, a small source of horizontal angle change of unknown origin, independent of the sextupole strength, requires a sextupole strength range larger than now available to measure accurately the typical horizontal beam size at CESR.</description>

      <title>On the rework and development of new Geant4 Cherenkov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment showed that a Cherenkov radiation spectrum from thin radiators possessing frequency dispersion could transform into quasi-monochromatic spectral lines. Simulations based on the standard Geant4 toolkit could not correctly describe the experimental results because Geant4 uses the traditional Frank-Tamm theory developed for an ideal (infinitely thick) radiator. Because of that, our endeavors in this paper are to present a new way of utilizing Cherenkov radiation using new Gneat4 models, while the paper should be used as a helping text to understand the Cherenkov process in Geant4 and what one can expect out of new models. Now, one can analyze quasi-monochromatic Cherenkov spectral lines using Geant4, which is a significant milestone for investigating the possibilities of this technique.</description>

      <title>JUTRACK: a Julia package for auto-differentiable accelerator modeling and particle tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient accelerator modeling and particle tracking are key for the design and configuration of modern particle accelerators. In this work, we present JUTRACK, a nested accelerator modeling package developed in Julia programing language and enhanced with compiler-level automatic differentiation (AD). With the aid of AD, JUTRACK enables rapid derivative calculations in accelerator modeling, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimization tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AD-derived derivatives through several practical applications, including sensitivity analysis of space-charge-induced emittance growth, nonlinear beam dynamics analysis for a synchrotron light source, and lattice parameter tuning of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Through the incorporation of automatic differentiation, this package opens up new possibilities for accelerator physicists in beam physics studies and accelerator design optimization.</description>

      <title>electronCT -- An Imaging Technique Using Very-high Energy Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronCT technique is an imaging method based on the multiple Coulomb scattering of relativistic electrons and has potential applications in medical and industrial imaging. It utilizes a pencil beam of electrons in the very high energy electron (VHEE, 50-250 MeV) range and a single detection layer for the determination of the beam profile. The technique constitutes a projectional, two-dimensional imaging method and thus also qualifies for the tomographic reconstruction of samples. Given the simplicity of the technical setup and its location behind the sample, the electronCT technique has potential synergies with VHEE radiotherapy, making use of the same electron source for both treatment and diagnostics and thus being a candidate for in-situ imaging and patient localization. At the same time, several technical challenges arise from the measurement technique when applied for the imaging of living beings. Measurements performed at the ARES linear particle accelerator at an electron energy of 155 MeV using a mouse phantom and a Timepix3 silicon pixel detector assembly demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. Both projectional and tomographic reconstructions are presented and the potential and limits of the technology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherent High-Harmonic Generation with Laser-Plasma Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active energy compression scheme is presently being investigated for future laser-plasma accelerators. This method enables generating laser-plasma accelerator electron beams with a small, $\sim 10^{-5}$, relative slice energy spread. When modulated by a laser pulse, such beams can produce coherent radiation at very high, $\sim 100$-th harmonics of the modulation laser wavelength, which are hard to access by conventional techniques. The scheme has a potential of providing additional capabilities for future plasma-based facilities by generating stable, tunable, narrow-band radiation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of laser wakefield acceleration in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) aiming to produce molybdenum-99 via photonuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
