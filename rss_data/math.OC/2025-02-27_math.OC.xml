      <title>Multigrid methods for total variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a nonsmooth coherence condition, we construct and prove the convergence of a forward-backward splitting method that alternates between steps on a fine and a coarse grid. Our focus is a total variation regularised inverse imaging problems, specifically, their dual problems, for which we develop in detail the relevant coarse-grid problems. We demonstrate the performance of our method on total variation denoising and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of singularly perturbed networked control systems over a single channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the emulation-based stabilization of nonlinear networked control systems with two time scales. We address the challenge of using a single communication channel for transmitting both fast and slow variables between the plant and the controller. A novel dual clock mechanism is proposed to schedule transmissions for this purpose. The system is modeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, and singular perturbation analysis is employed to determine individual maximum allowable transmission intervals for both fast and slow variables, ensuring semi-global practical asymptotic stability. Enhanced stability guarantees are also provided under stronger assumptions. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Pricing Experiments in Matching Marketplaces under Interference: Designs and Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference between treated and untreated units is a source of bias in marketplace experiments. In this paper, we specifically consider pricing interventions, in which a platform seeks to adjust base pricing levels at the marketplace level in order to increase demand. In a matching marketplace, this type of experiment leads to a crucial design question: should the platform match treated and untreated units differently because they paid different prices? We find that standard estimation techniques are biased, but the sign of this bias depends strongly on this design choice. Bias can be reduced by using the ``shadow price estimator'', which relies on the optimal dual solution of the platform's supply-demand matching problem -- especially when the platform chooses to ignore pricing differences at matching time. We validate our findings both theoretically in a fluid limit setting, and numerically in a finite-sample setting.</description>

      <title>Damping Tuning Considering Random Disturbances Adopting Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios where high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is connected to the grid over long distances, the output of RES exhibits significant fluctuations, making it difficult to accurately characterize. The intermittency and uncertainty of these fluctuations pose challenges to the stability of the power system. This paper proposes a distributionally robust damping optimization control framework (DRDOC) to address the uncertainty in the true distribution of random disturbances caused by RES. First, the installation location of damping controllers and key control parameters are determined through Sobol sensitivity indices and participation factors. Next, a nonlinear relationship between damping and random disturbances is established with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). The uncertainty in the distribution of disturbances is captured by ambiguity sets. The DRDOC is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is further simplified for efficient computation. Finally, the optimal control parameters are derived through convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and distribution robustness of the proposed DRDOC.</description>

      <title>Developing heuristic solution techniques for large-scale unit commitment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shifting towards renewable energy sources and reducing carbon emissions necessitate sophisticated energy system planning, optimization, and extension. Energy systems optimization models (ESOMs) often form the basis for political and operational decision-making. ESOMs are frequently formulated as linear (LPs) and mixed-integer linear (MIP) problems. MIPs allow continuous and discrete decision variables. Consequently, they are substantially more expressive than LPs but also more challenging to solve. The ever-growing size and complexity of ESOMs take a toll on the computational time of state-of-the-art commercial solvers. Indeed, for large-scale ESOMs, solving the LP relaxation -- the basis of modern MIP solution algorithms -- can be very costly. These time requirements can render ESOM MIPs impractical for real-world applications. This article considers a set of large-scale decarbonization-focused unit commitment models with expansion decisions based on the REMix framework (up to 83 million variables and 900,000 discrete decision variables). For these particular instances, the solution to the LP relaxation and the MIP optimum lie close. Based on this observation, we investigate the application of relaxation-enforced neighborhood search (RENS), machine learning guided rounding, and a fix-and-propagate (FP) heuristic as a standalone solution method. Our approach generated feasible solutions 20 to 100 times faster than GUROBI, achieving comparable solution quality with primal-dual gaps as low as 1% and up to 35%. This enabled us to solve numerous scenarios without lowering the quality of our models. For some instances that GUROBI could not solve within two days, our \FP method provided feasible solutions in under one hour.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic approaches to avoiding bad local minima in nonconvex inconsistent feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge of nonconvex optimization is to find a global optimum, or at least to avoid ``bad'' local minima and meaningless stationary points. We study here the extent to which algorithms, as opposed to optimization models and regularization, can be tuned to accomplish this goal. The model we consider is a nonconvex, inconsistent feasibility problem with many local minima, where these are points at which the gaps between the sets are smallest on neighborhoods of these points. The algorithms that we compare are all projection-based algorithms, specifically cyclic projections, the cyclic relaxed Douglas-Rachford algorithm, and relaxed Douglas-Rachford splitting on the product space. The local convergence and fixed points of these algorithms have already been characterized in pervious theoretical studies. We demonstrate the theory for these algorithms in the context of orbital tomographic imaging from angle-resolved photon emission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, both synthetically generated and experimental. Our results show that, while the cyclic projections and cyclic relaxed Douglas-Rachford algorithms generally converge the fastest, the method of relaxed Douglas-Rachford splitting on the product space does move away from bad local minima of the other two algorithms, settling eventually on clusters of local minima corresponding to globally optimal critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of the Flexible Foil Mesh Generation (FFMG) method to model the $3D$ Focal Body generated by a spherical mirror collecting light from an infinitely distant source on its optical axis. The study addresses the challenge of accurately representing highly concave structures formed by the focusing effect. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the FFMG method in capturing the intricate geometry of the Focal Body, with implications for computational geometry, $3D$ reconstruction, and optical system modeling.</description>

      <title>Langevin Multiplicative Weights Update with Applications in Polynomial Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonconvex optimization problem over simplex, and more generally, a product of simplices. We provide an algorithm, Langevin Multiplicative Weights Update (LMWU) for solving global optimization problems by adding a noise scaling with the non-Euclidean geometry in the simplex. Non-convex optimization has been extensively studied by machine learning community due to its application in various scenarios such as neural network approximation and finding Nash equilibrium. Despite recent progresses on provable guarantee of escaping and avoiding saddle point (convergence to local minima) and global convergence of Langevin gradient based method without constraints, the global optimization with constraints is less studied. We show that LMWU algorithm is provably convergent to interior global minima with a non-asymptotic convergence analysis. We verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in real data set from polynomial portfolio management, where optimization of a highly non-linear objective function plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>A Non-Monotone Line-Search Method for Minimizing Functions with Spurious Local Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new non-monotone line-search method for smooth unconstrained optimization problems with objective functions that have many non-global local minimizers. The method is based on a relaxed Armijo condition that allows a controllable increase in the objective function between consecutive iterations. This property helps the iterates escape from nearby local minimizers in the early iterations. For objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients, we derive worst-case complexity estimates on the number of iterations needed for the method to find approximate stationary points. Numerical results are presented, showing that the new method can significantly outperform other non-monotone methods on functions with spurious local minima.</description>

      <title>Provable Model-Parallel Distributed Principal Component Analysis with Parallel Deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework where each worker targets a distinct eigenvector and refines its solution by updating from intermediate solutions provided by peers deemed as "superior". Drawing intuition from the deflation method in centralized eigenvalue problems, our approach breaks the sequential dependency in the deflation steps and allows asynchronous updates of workers, while incurring only a small communication cost. To our knowledge, a gap in the literature -- the theoretical underpinning of such distributed, dynamic interactions among workers -- has remained unaddressed. This paper offers a theoretical analysis explaining why, how, and when these intermediate, hierarchical updates lead to practical and provable convergence in distributed environments. Despite being a theoretical work, our prototype implementation demonstrates that such a distributed PCA algorithm converges effectively and in scalable way: through experiments, our proposed framework offers comparable performance to EigenGame-$\mu$, the state-of-the-art model-parallel PCA solver.</description>

      <title>Locational Energy Storage Bid Bounds for Facilitating Social Welfare Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to generate bid ceilings for energy storage in electricity markets to facilitate social welfare convergence and regulate potential market power exercises. We derive the bid bounds based on a tractable multi-period economic dispatch chance-constrained formulation that systematically incorporates the uncertainty and risk preference of the system operator. The key analytical results verify that the bounds effectively cap the truthful storage bid across all uncertainty scenarios with a guaranteed confidence level. And the cleared storage bids should be bounded by the risk-aware locational marginal price. We show that bid bonds decrease as the state of charge increases but rise with greater net load uncertainty and risk preference. We test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing mechanism based on the 8-bus ISO-NE test system, including agent-based storage bidding models. Simulation results show that the bid bounds effectively adjust storage bids to align with the social welfare objective. Under 30% renewable capacity and 20% storage capacity, the bid bounds contribute to an average reduction of 0.17% in system cost, while increasing storage profit by an average of 10.16% across various system uncertainty scenarios and bidding strategies. These benefits scale up with increased storage capacity withholding and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Expected Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inequalities (VIs) encompass many fundamental problems in diverse areas ranging from engineering to economics and machine learning. However, their considerable expressivity comes at the cost of computational intractability. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a natural relaxation -- which we refer to as expected variational inequalities (EVIs) -- where the goal is to find a distribution that satisfies the VI constraint in expectation. By adapting recent techniques from game theory, we show that, unlike VIs, EVIs can be solved in polynomial time under general (nonmonotone) operators. EVIs capture the seminal notion of correlated equilibria, but enjoy a greater reach beyond games. We also employ our framework to capture and generalize several existing disparate results, including from settings such as smooth games, and games with coupled constraints or nonconcave utilities.</description>

      <title>An NEPv Approach for Feature Selection via Orthogonal OCCA with the (2,1)-norm Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel feature selection model via orthogonal canonical correlation analysis with the $(2,1)$-norm regularization is proposed, and the model is solved by a practical NEPv approach (nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency), yielding a feature selection method named OCCA-FS. It is proved that OCCA-FS always produces a sequence of approximations with monotonic objective values and is globally convergent. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to compare OCCA-FS against existing feature selection methods. The numerical results demonstrate that OCCA-FS produces superior classification performance and often comes out on the top among all feature selection methods in comparison.</description>

      <title>Application of quasi-Monte Carlo in Mine Countermeasure Simulations with a Stochastic Optimal Control Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling and simulating mine countermeasures search missions performed by autonomous vehicles equipped with a sensor capable of detecting mines at sea is a challenging endeavour. The output of our stochastic optimal control implementation consists of an optimal trajectory in a square domain for the autonomous vehicle such that the total mission time is minimized for a given residual risk of not detecting sea mines. We model this risk as an expected value integral. We found that upon completion of the simulation, the user requested residual risk is usually not satisfied. We solved this by implementing a relaxation strategy which consists of incrementally increasing the square search domain. We then combined this strategy with different quasi-Monte Carlo schemes used for solving the integral. We found that using a Rank-1 Lattice scheme yields a speedup up to a factor two with respect to the Monte Carlo scheme. We also present an implementation which allows us to compute a trajectory in a convex quadrilateral domain, as opposed to a square domain, and combine it with our relaxation strategy.</description>

      <title>The Sharpness Disparity Principle in Transformers for Accelerating Language Model Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers, normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 1.1B and datasets of OpenWebText and MiniPile. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.</description>

Abstract: We consider an optimal investment-consumption problem for a utility-maximizing investor who has access to assets with different liquidity and whose consumption rate as well as terminal wealth are subject to lower-bound constraints. Assuming utility functions that satisfy standard conditions, we develop a methodology for deriving the optimal strategies in semi-closed form. Our methodology is based on the generalized martingale approach and the decomposition of the problem into subproblems. We illustrate our approach by deriving explicit formulas for agents with power-utility functions and discuss potential extensions of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Pairwise independent correlation gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a ``pairwise independent correlation gap'' for set functions with random elements. The pairwise independent correlation gap is defined as the ratio of the maximum expected value of a set function with arbitrary dependence among the elements with fixed marginal probabilities to the maximum expected value with pairwise independent elements with the same marginal probabilities. We show that for any nonnegative monotone submodular set function defined on $n$ elements, this ratio is upper bounded by $4/3$ in the following two cases: (a) $n = 3$ for all marginal probabilities and (b) all $n$ for small marginal probabilities (and similarly large marginal probabilities). This differs from the bound on the ``correlation gap'' which holds with mutual independence and showcases the fundamental difference between pairwise independence and mutual independence. We discuss the implication of the results with two examples and end the paper with a conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study a variant of an accelerated gradient algorithm of Nesterov and Spokoiny. We call this algorithm the Nesterov--Spokoiny Acceleration (NSA). The NSA algorithm simultaneously satisfies the following property: For a smooth convex objective $f \in \mathscr{F}_{L}^{\infty,1} (\mathbb{R}^n) $, the sequence $\{ \mathbf{x}_k \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ governed by NSA satisfies $ \limsup\limits_{k \to \infty } k^2 ( f (\mathbf{x}_k ) - f^* ) = 0 $, where $f^* &gt; -\infty$ is the minimum of $f$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Vaccine Site Locations While Considering Travel Inconvenience and Public Health Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were over three million infections in Los Angeles County (LAC). To facilitate distribution when vaccines first became available, LAC set up six mega-sites for dispensing a large number of vaccines to the public. To understand if another choice of mega-site location would have improved accessibility and health outcomes, and to provide insight into future vaccine allocation problems, we propose a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that balances travel convenience, infection reduction, and equitable distribution. We provide a tractable objective formulation that effectively proxies real-world public health goals of reducing infections while considering travel inconvenience and equitable distribution of resources. Compared with the solution empirically used in LAC in 2020, we recommend more dispersed mega-site locations that result in a 28% reduction in travel inconvenience and avert an additional 1,000 infections.</description>

      <title>LancBiO: dynamic Lanczos-aided bilevel optimization via Krylov subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, with broad applications in machine learning, has an intricate hierarchical structure. Gradient-based methods have emerged as a common approach to large-scale bilevel problems. However, the computation of the hyper-gradient, which involves a Hessian inverse vector product, confines the efficiency and is regarded as a bottleneck. To circumvent the inverse, we construct a sequence of low-dimensional approximate Krylov subspaces with the aid of the Lanczos process. As a result, the constructed subspace is able to dynamically and incrementally approximate the Hessian inverse vector product with less effort and thus leads to a favorable estimate of the hyper-gradient. Moreover, we propose a provable subspace-based framework for bilevel problems where one central step is to solve a small-size tridiagonal linear system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that subspace techniques are incorporated into bilevel optimization. This successful trial not only enjoys $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ convergence rate but also demonstrates efficiency in a synthetic problem and two deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>An enhanced heuristic framework for solving the Rank Pricing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rank Pricing Problem (RPP) is a challenging bilevel optimization problem with binary variables whose objective is to determine the optimal pricing strategy for a set of products to maximize the total benefit, given that customer preferences influence the price for each product. Traditional methods for solving RPP are based on exact approaches which may be computationally expensive. In contrast, this paper presents a novel heuristic approach that takes advantage of the structure of the problem to obtain good solutions. The proposed approach consists of two phases. Firstly, a standard heuristic is applied to get a pricing strategy. In our case, we choose to use the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), and the genetic algorithm. Both methodologies are very popular for their effectiveness in solving combinatorial optimization problems. The solution obtained after running these algorithms is improved in a second phase, where four different local searches are applied. Such local searches use the information of the RPP to get better solutions, that is, there is no need to solve new optimization problems. Even though our methodology does not have optimality guarantees, our computational experiments show that it outperforms Mixed Integer Program solvers regarding solution quality and computational burden.</description>

      <title>A new problem qualification based on approximate KKT conditions for Lipschitzian optimization with application to bilevel programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with general Lipschitzian optimization problems, there are many problem classes where even weak constraint qualifications fail at local minimizers. In contrast to a constraint qualification, a problem qualification does not only rely on the constraints but also on the objective function to guarantee that a local minimizer is a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. For example, calmness in the sense of Clarke is a problem qualification. In this article, we introduce the Subset Mangasarian-Fromovitz Condition (subMFC). This new problem qualification is derived by means of a nonsmooth version of the approximate KKT conditions, which hold at every local minimizer without further assumptions. A comparison with existing constraint and problem qualifications reveals that subMFC is strictly weaker than quasinormality and can hold even if the local error bound condition, the cone-continuity property, the Guignard constraint qualification and calmness are violated. Furthermore, we emphasize the power of the new problem qualification within the context of bilevel optimization. More precisely, under mild assumptions on the problem data, we suggest a version of subMFC that is tailored to the lower-level value function reformulation. It turns out that this new condition can be satisfied even if the widely used partial calmness condition does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integer programming-based optimization framework designed to effectively address the complex final exam scheduling challenges encountered at Cornell University. With high flexibility, the framework is specifically tailored to accommodate a variety of different constraints, including the front-loading of large courses and the exclusion of specific time slots during the exam period. By generating multiple scheduling model variants and incorporating heuristic approaches, our framework enables comprehensive comparisons of different schedules. This empowers the University Registrar to make informed decisions, considering trade-offs in terms of schedule comfort measured by different levels of exam conflicts. Our results demonstrate significant advantage over the historical lecture time-based approach, providing time and effort savings for the university administration while enhancing student and faculty satisfaction.</description>

Abstract: The population control problem is a parameterized control problem where a population of agents has to be moved simultaneously into a target state. The decision problem asks whether this can be achieved for a finite but arbitrarily large population. We focus on the random version of this problem, where every agent is a copy of the same automaton and non-determinism on the global action chosen by the controller is resolved independently and uniformly at random. Controller seeks to almost-surely gather the agents in the target states. We show that the random population control problem is exptime-complete.</description>

Abstract: This contribution examines optimization problems that involve stochastic dominance constraints. These problems have uncountably many constraints. We develop methods to solve the optimization problem by reducing the constraints to a finite set of test points needed to verify stochastic dominance. This improves both theoretical understanding and computational efficiency. Our approach introduces two formulations of stochastic dominance$\unicode{x2013}$one employs expectation operators and another based on risk measures$\unicode{x2013}$allowing for efficient verification processes. Additionally, we develop an optimization framework incorporating these stochastic dominance constraints. Numerical results validate the robustness of our method, showcasing its effectiveness for solving higher-order stochastic dominance problems, with applications to fields such as portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization by Kernel Regression and Density-based Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is highly effective for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, but it faces significant computational challenges due to the high computational complexity of Gaussian processes, which results in a total time complexity that is quartic with respect to the number of iterations. To address this limitation, we propose the Bayesian Optimization by Kernel regression and density-based Exploration (BOKE) algorithm. BOKE uses kernel regression for efficient function approximation, kernel density for exploration, and integrates them into the confidence bound criteria to guide the optimization process, thus reducing computational costs to quadratic. Our theoretical analysis rigorously establishes the global convergence of BOKE and ensures its robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks, we demonstrate that BOKE not only performs competitively compared to Gaussian process-based methods but also exhibits superior computational efficiency. These results highlight BOKE's effectiveness in resource-constrained environments, providing a practical approach for optimization problems in engineering applications.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic dominance is a fundamental concept in decision-making under uncertainty and quantitative finance, yet its practical application is hindered by computational intractability due to infinitely many constraints. We introduce the Julia package StochasticDominance, an open-source tool that efficiently verifies and optimizes under higher-order stochastic dominance constraints. Our approach builds on recent theoretical advancements that reduce infinite constraints to a finite number, making higher-order stochastic dominance more accessible. This package provides a user-friendly, black-box solution, enabling researchers and practitioners to incorporate stochastic dominance constraints seamlessly into their optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>A variational and symplectic framework for model-free control: preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4237</link>
      <description>arXiv:1011.4237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model-free control approach is an advanced control law that requires few information about the process to control. Since its introduction in 2008, numerous applications have been successfully considered, highlighting attractive robustness properties towards tracking efficiency and disturbance rejection. In this work, a variational approach of the model-free control is proposed in order to extend its robustness capabilities. An adaptive formulation of the controller is proposed using the calculus of variations within a symplectic framework, that aims to consider the control law as an optimization problem toward the auto-tuning of its main key parameter. The proposed formulation provides a coupling between the model-free control law and a variational integrator to improve the robustness of the tracking towards process changes and emphasize closed-loop stabilization. Some illustrative examples are discussed to highlight the rightness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>On real and observable rational realizations of input-output equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a single (differential-algebraic) input-output equation, we present a method for finding different representations of the associated system in the form of rational realizations; these are dynamical systems with rational right-hand sides. It has been shown that in the case where the input-output equation is of order one, rational realizations can be computed, if they exist. In this work, we focus first on the existence and actual computation of the so-called observable rational realizations, and secondly on rational realizations with real coefficients. The study of observable realizations allows to find every rational realization of a given first order input-output equation, and the necessary field extensions in this process. We show that for first order input-output equations the existence of a rational realization is equivalent to the existence of an observable rational realization. Moreover, we give a criterion to decide the existence of real rational realizations. The computation of observable and real realizations of first order input-output equations is fully algorithmic. We also present partial results for the case of higher order input-output equations.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration for Diffusion Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models, while achieving minimax optimality for sampling, are often hampered by slow sampling speeds due to the high computational burden of score function evaluations. Despite the recent remarkable empirical advances in speeding up the score-based samplers, theoretical understanding of acceleration techniques remains largely limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel training-free acceleration scheme for stochastic samplers. Under minimal assumptions -- namely, $L^2$-accurate score estimates and a finite second-moment condition on the target distribution -- our accelerated sampler provably achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy in total variation within $\widetilde{O}(d^{5/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ iterations, thereby significantly improving upon the $\widetilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)$ iteration complexity of standard score-based samplers for $\varepsilon\leq 1/\sqrt{d}$. Notably, our convergence theory does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the target distribution or higher-order score estimation guarantees.</description>
