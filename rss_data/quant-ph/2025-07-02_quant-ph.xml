      <title>Segmentation-Based Regression for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware motivate the development of algorithmic frameworks that integrate quantum sampling with classical inference. This work introduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural networks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit sequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the regression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit lattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and tractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum circuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while classical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error functionals. We formalize the algorithm from first principles, derive convergence and complexity bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness on inverse problems involving PDE-constrained models. The resulting framework provides a robust, high-precision interface between quantum outputs and continuous scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Studying few cluster resonances with quantum neural network driven iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the quantum computing the properties of hypernuclei ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He, ${}^{\ 6}_{{\Lambda\Lambda}}$He and ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be can be investigated within microscopic cluster model. Our approach combines quantum neural network (QNN) with iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (IHHL) algorithm (abbreviated as QNN-IHHL) to solve the quantum many-body problem. To efficiently describe resonance phenomena, we employ complex scaling and eigenvector continuation techniques, providing a robust framework for identifying few-cluster resonance parameters within quantum computing. To validate our quantum algorithm, the resonant $4^{+}$ state of ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be is chosen as a core example. With QNN-IHHL algorithm we realize a fully quantum workflow, which provides a novel framework and some ground work for exploring resonance properties in complex nuclear many-body systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first quantum authentication scheme for continuous-variable states. Our scheme is based on trap states, and is an adaptation of a discrete-variable scheme by Broadbent et al. (arXiv:1211.1080), but with more freedom in choosing the number of traps. We provide a security proof, mostly following the approach of Broadbent and Wainewright (arXiv:1607.03075). As a necessary ingredient for the proof we derive the continuous-variable analogue of the Pauli Twirl.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the connection between logical independence and the algebraic structure of quantum mechanics. Building on results by Brukner et al., it introduces the notion of \textit{onto-epistemic ignorance}: situations in which the truth of a proposition is not deducible due to an objective breakdown in the phenomenal chain that transmits information from a system A to a system B, rather than to any subjective lack of knowledge. It is shown that, under such conditions, the probabilities accessible to a real observer are necessarily conditioned by decidability and obey a non-commutative algebra, formally equivalent to the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Broadband optical time-domain reflectometry for quantum key distribution security analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for security analysis against the Trojan-horse attacks (THA) launched to a practical fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system across a wide spectral range. To achieve this, we utilize optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for the spectral reflectance analysis in the near-infrared range 1100 - 1800 nm with centimeter-level resolution and with a noise floor down to -80 dB. Finally, the total theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical Systems with Linear and Quadratic Position Couplings: Dynamics and Optimal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an optomechanical system consisting of a single-mode optical field coupled to a mechanical oscillator, where the nonlinear interaction includes both linear and quadratic terms in the oscillator's position. We present a full analytical solution to this quantum mechanical Hamiltonian problem by employing the formalism of two-phonon coherent states. Quantum estimation theory is applied to the resulting state of the optical field, with a focus on evaluating the classical and quantum Fisher information for estimating the strength of the quadratic coupling. Our estimation scheme considers both standard and balanced homodyne photodetection, assuming an initial optical state prepared as a superposition of vacuum and single-photon states. We show that balanced homodyne detection can saturate the quantum Fisher information, thus reaching the ultimate precision bound for estimating the quadratic coupling. Additionally, we investigate the effect of thermal noise on the quantum Fisher information in a realistic experimental context.</description>

      <title>Preparation of cat states in many-body eigenbasis via non-local measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered dissipation offers a promising route to prepare correlated quantum many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access using purely unitary protocols. However, creating superpositions of multiple many-body eigenstates with tunable properties remains a major challenge. We propose to periodically interrupt the many-body evolution by precisely removing a given many-body Fock state through a non-local post-selected measurement protocol. Upon tuning the measurement period, we show that a dark state manifold survives the removal, allowing us to filter the system and generate a coherent superposition within this manifold at long times. As a testbed, we study a non-integrable spin-1 XY chain featuring a solvable family of eigenstates that can differ macroscopically in quasi-particle excitations. Our protocol generates tunable superpositions of these eigenstates, including the spin-1 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a generalized variant with tunable spatiotemporal order. Under perturbations, the system exhibits an exceptionally long-lived metastable regime where the engineered superpositions remain robust. Our work provides new insight into quantum state preparation via non-local measurements using tools available in current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Fully Parallelized BP Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes Can Outperform BP-OSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a lightweight decoder based solely on belief-propagation (BP), augmented with a speculative post-processing strategy inspired by classical Chase decoding. Our method identifies unreliable bits via BP oscillation statistics, generates a set of modified test patterns, and decodes them in parallel using low-iteration BP. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve logical error rates comparable to or even better than BP-OSD, but has lower latency over its parallelization for a variety of bivariate bicycle codes, which significantly reduces decoding complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs</description>

      <title>Destructive Interference of Inertial Noise in Matter-wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal qubit under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Depth Decomposition of Approximate Multi-Controlled Single-Qubit Gates Without Ancilla Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates are essential components in this process. In this work, we present improved decompositions of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a single ancilla qubit, while also reducing the constant factors in the circuit depth compared to previous work. We optimize a previously proposed decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary U(2) gates without using ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this project is freely available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum Bayesian inference method for intrusion detection, using explicitly constructed quantum circuits and statevector simulation. Prior and conditional probabilities are encoded via unitary gates, and posterior distributions are extracted through symbolic post-selection. Applied to a scenario with network spikes, system vulnerabilities, and false alarms, the method yields joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities aligned with causal structure. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and interpretability of quantum-native inference for information security applications</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Thermalization in Finite Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the problem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present evidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical polynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under which it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity two-qubit quantum logic gates in a trapped-ion chain using axial motional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are one of the leading platforms for quantum information processing, where a key challenge is to scale up system size while maintaining high-fidelity two-qubit operations. A promising approach is to build high-performance modules interconnected via strong coupling. In particular, axial motional modes provide a feasible means of coupling short ion chains. However, previous implementations of fully connected 5-ion modules based on axial modes have been limited to fidelities of $96.6-98.0\%$. Here, we demonstrate two-qubit quantum logic gates in a 5-ion $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ chain using axial modes, achieving fidelities exceeding $99\%$ for adjacent pairs and over $98\%$ for arbitrary pairs by carefully tackling dominant error sources. Our results are beneficial to the development of scalable ion-trap quantum processors, quantum simulation and quantum-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational photon echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations. Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the foundation for the controllable gravitational quantum optics on Earth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and dynamic control of the spatial mode of the dark-state polarization using electromagnetically induced transparency are theoretically investigated. We demonstrate that a combination of synthetic scalar and vector potentials can be employed to engineer discrete spatial modes of the dark state polariton, enabling quantum interference among these modes. We verify this concept by showing the Rabi oscillation between two spatial modes and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage among $\Lambda$-type three modes. Our approach allows for the reallocation of stored photonic data from one location to another, presenting potential applications such as photonic memory optimization and retrieved light modulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A positive economic effect from the implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) technology can be achieved only with significant scaling, which involves the deployment of branched metropolitan area networks. The creation of QKD systems suitable for such networks is an important task for the coming years. This paper considers a method for preparing quantum states using pulsed optical injection, which can be used as a basis for a compact modulator-free transmitter ideally suited for QKD at typical distances within a city. Considering the relative proximity between nodes of a MAN, we suggest to abandon the decoy states, which, together with the proposed method of quantum state preparation, allows making the transmitter extremely simple. We report here the results of an experiment confirming the operating principle and provide a security analysis of the three-state decoy-free QKD protocol that can be implemented using such a device.</description>

      <title>Behavior of quantum coherence in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes of light-matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes exhibit a variety of intriguing physical phenomena. In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a two-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to research the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled oscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the matter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the photon mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower optical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for either total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of quantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms. When heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem coherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total coherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower frequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These results demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give rise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable insights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have potential applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Integration of quantum random number generators with post-quantum cryptography algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using open-source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS) model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS handshake time.</description>

      <title>Certifying semi-device-independent security via wave-particle duality experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-particle duality is known to be equivalent to an entropic uncertainty relation based on the min- and max-entropies, which have a clear operational meaning in quantum cryptography. Here, we derive a connection between wave-particle relations and the semi-device-independent (SDI) security framework. In particular, we express an SDI witness entirely in terms of two complementary interferometric quantities: visibility and input distinguishability. Applying a symmetry condition to the interferometric quantities, we identify a scenario in which the classical bound is violated and the security condition is met in wave-particle experiments with a tunable beam splitter. This enables the certification of non-classicality and the positivity of the key rate directly from complementary interferometric quantities. Moreover, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using orbital-angular-momentum encoded quantum states of light in a tunable interferometer, validating our theoretical predictions. Finally, we analyze an improved bound on the SDI security condition, effectively enlarging the parameter region where secure communication can be certified.</description>

      <title>Evolution of multi-qubit correlations driven by mutual interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A particularly useful tool for characterizing multi-qubit systems is the correlation tensor, providing an experimentally friendly and theoretically concise representation of quantum states. In this work, we analyze the evolution of the correlation tensor elements of quantum systems composed of $\frac12$-spins, generated by mutual interactions and the influence of the external field. We focus on two-body interactions in the form of anisotropic Heisenberg as well as antisymmetric exchange interaction models. The evolution of the system is visualized in the form of a trajectory in a suitable correlation space, which, depending on the system's frequencies, exhibits periodic or nonperiodic behavior. In the case of two $\frac12$-spins we study the stationary correlations for several classes of Hamiltonians, which allows a full characterization of the families of density matrices invariant under the evolution generated by the Hamiltonians. We discuss some common properties shared by the 2- and 3-qubit systems and show how a strong external field can play a stabilizing factor with respect to certain correlation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Patterns to Support the Development of Hybrid Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides computational advantages in various domains. To benefit from these advantages complex hybrid quantum applications must be built, which comprise both quantum and classical programs. Engineering these applications requires immense expertise in physics, mathematics, and software engineering. To facilitate the development of quantum applications, a corresponding quantum computing pattern language providing proven solutions to recurring problems has been presented. However, identifying suitable patterns for tackling a specific application scenario and subsequently combining them in an application is a time-consuming manual task. To overcome this issue, we present an approach that enables (i) the automated detection of patterns solving a given problem, (ii) the selection of suitable implementations fulfilling non-functional requirements of the user, and (iii) the automated aggregation of these solutions into an executable quantum application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information engines harness measurement and feedback to convert energy into useful work. In this study, we investigate the fundamental trade-offs between ergotropic output power, thermodynamic efficiency and information-to-work conversion efficiency in such engines, explicitly accounting for the finite time required for measurement. As a model engine, we consider a two-level quantum system from which work is extracted via a temporarily coupled quantum harmonic oscillator that serves as the measurement device. This quantum device is subsequently read out by a classical apparatus. We compute trade-offs for the performance of the information engine using Pareto optimisation, which has recently been successfully used to optimise performance in engineering and biological physics. Our results offer design principles for future experimental implementations of information engines, such as in nano-mechanical systems and circuit QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups for Polynomial-Time Dynamic Programming Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum dynamic programming framework that allows us to directly extend to the quantum realm a large body of classical dynamic programming algorithms. The corresponding quantum dynamic programming algorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart, while achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or optimization) problem $\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\mathcal P$, such a speedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\delta$ of the dependency digraph $G_{\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive formulation of $\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of $\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to those on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to solve the considered problems in $\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\mathcal{P}}(I))| \sqrt{\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical upper bound when $m \in \Omega(n^{1.4})$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution with Polynomial Resources in Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental to analyzing quantum many-body systems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in both system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the system-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with measurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution time increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized imaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to maintain stable success probability over large imaginary times. Our algorithm approximates the target state to polynomially small errors in inverse imaginary time using polynomially many elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla qubit, achieving success probability close to one. When the initial state has reasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves polynomial resource complexity in the system size. We extend this approach to ground-state preparation and ground-state energy estimation, achieving reduced circuit depth compared to existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness for long-time evolution and its potential applications for early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Static disorder-induced renormalization of polariton group velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton slowdown in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Light Manipulation via Tunable Collective Quantum States in Waveguide-Coupled Bragg and Anti-Bragg Superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A many-body quantum system which consists of collective quantum states, such as superradiant and subradiant states, behaves as a multi-level superatom in light-matter interaction. In this work, we experimentally study one-dimensional superatoms in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with a periodic array of superconducting artificial atoms. We engineer the periodic atomic array with two distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\lambda_0/2$ and $d$=$\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering conditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to maintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic frequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly different quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency and a broad photonic bandgap. Moreover, due to strong waveguide-atom couplings in superconducting quantum circuits, efficient light manipulations are realized in small-size systems. Our work demonstrates tunable optical properties of Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, as well as their potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators permit unitary evolution interspersed with locally resolved mid-circuit measurements. This paves the way for the observation of large-scale space-time structures in quantum trajectories and opens a window for the \emph{in situ} analysis of complex dynamical processes. We demonstrate this idea using a paradigmatic dissipative spin model, which can be implemented, e.g., on Rydberg quantum simulators. Here, already the trajectories of individual experimental runs reveal surprisingly complex statistical phenomena. In particular, we exploit free-energy functionals for trajectory ensembles to identify dynamical features reminiscent of hydrophobic behavior observed near the liquid-vapor transition in the presence of solutes in water. We show that these phenomena are observable in experiments and discuss the impact of common imperfections, such as readout errors and disordered interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies how a suitably-designed classical system generates with a quantum-like (QL) state space mediated by a graph. The graph plays a special dual role by directing the topology of the classical network and defining a state space that comprises superpositions of states in a tensor product basis. The basis for constructing QL graphs and their properties is reviewed and extended. An optimization of the graph product is developed to produce a more compact graph with the essential properties required to produce states that mimic many of the properties of quantum states. This provides a concrete visualization of the correlation structure in a quantum state space. The question of whether and, if so, how, entanglement can be exhibited by these QL systems is discussed critically and contrasted to the concept of `classical entanglement' in optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks enhance quantum communication schemes and link multiple users over large areas. Harnessing high dimensional quantum states - i.e. qu-d-its - allows for a denser transfer of information with increased robustness to noise compared to qubits. Frequency encoding enables access to such qu-d-its at telecom wavelengths, while manipulating quantum information with off-the-shelf fibered devices.
  We use a low free spectral range silicon microresonator to generate Bell states of dimension d=2 (qubits) and d=3 (qutrits) via spontaneous four wave mixing, to implement and optimize a multi-dimensional frequency-bin entanglement-based quantum key distribution network.
  We tune the source (via pump power), the signal processing (via coincidence window size) and qu-d-it encoding (d=2 or 3) using a single fibered hardware based on Fourier-transform pulse shaping and electro-optic modulation depending on interconnection lengths. We achieve secure key rates of 1374 bit/s with qutrits, and estimate the communication range to 295 km with qubits. We access up to 80 frequency modes, resulting in 21 quantum channels, that provide stable communication over more than 21 hours. We demonstrate a competitive communication range in a multi-dimensional entanglement-based quantum key distribution network that lays the groundwork for larger dimensionality implementations deployed on metropolitan fiber links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for the solution of a three-dimensional, two-body Schr\"odinger equation for scattering states. The equation is first reduced to a system of coupled radial Schr\"odinger equations. The system of differential equations is approximated as an ordinary linear nonhomogeneous system using the finite difference method. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at the origin and at an arbitrary large radius. The physical $K$-matrix for real energies is calculated from the numerical solutions of this system by comparison to the analytical real solutions for large distances. Scattering amplitudes are calculated from the physical $K$-matrix. Scattering poles are obtained by extrapolating the $K$-matrix to complex energies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of tripartite entanglement in three-qubit Quantum Gravity-Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) with quantum decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.</description>

      <title>Running Quantum Computers in Discovery Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics. Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family) instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i) classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum k-SAT Related Hypergraph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum k-SAT problem is the quantum generalization of the k-SAT problem. It is the problem whether a given local Hamiltonian is frustration-free. Frustration-free means that the ground state of the k-local Hamiltonian minimizes the energy of every local interaction term simultaneously. This is a central question in quantum physics and a canonical QMA_1-complete problem. The Quantum k-SAT problem is not as well studied as the classical k-SAT problem in terms of special tractable cases, approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. In this paper, we will give a graph-theoretic study of the Quantum k-SAT problem with the structures core and radius. These hypergraph structures are important to solve the Quantum k-SAT problem. We can solve a Quantum k-SAT instance in polynomial time if the derived hypergraph has a core of size n-m+a, where a is a constant, and the radius is at most logarithmic. If it exists, we can find a core of size n-m+a with the best possible radius in polynomial time, whereas finding a general minimum core with minimal radius is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Encoding Strategies for Machine Learning Models: Proposing and Evaluating Instance Level, Global Discrete, and Class Conditional Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy (GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.</description>

      <title>The Metaphysics of Protection: Emergence, Agency, and the Ontological Status of Logical Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that the practice of fault-tolerant quantum computation, specifically the mechanism of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), offers a profoundly new lens through which to examine foundational questions of ontology, emergence, and interpretation. We move beyond the standard debate on quantum speedup to ask: What is the nature of the entity--the logical qubit--that is being protected, and what does the active, goal-directed process of its protection reveal about physical reality? We argue that the logical qubit presents a unique case study in the metaphysics of identity, functioning as a quantifiable "Ship of Theseus" in Hilbert space. We introduce the concept of "engineered emergence" to describe the active, information-driven stabilization of the logical qubit, distinguishing it from passive forms of emergence and positioning it as a new category of causal structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the logical qubit serves as a powerful new testbed for major interpretations of quantum mechanics (including agent-centered, Many-Worlds, and Bohmian views), revealing novel strengths and challenges for each. We conclude that the technological imperative of fault-tolerance is not merely an engineering problem but a catalyst for deep philosophical insight, transforming abstract debates into concrete physical questions.</description>

      <title>Detection of 2D SPT phases under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized measurements.</description>

      <title>Identifying Anyonic Topological Order in Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore &amp; Thomas (1980) then identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are 2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of quantum Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium Kibble-Zurek (KZ) dynamics in quantum Ising chains in a transverse field, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h(t)=t/t_s$ ($t_s$ is the time scale of the protocol), across their first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) at $h=0$. The KZ protocol starts at time $t_i&lt;0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s&lt;0$. Then, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f &gt; 0$, such that the magnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems, the KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) behaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power law on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions can be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy (magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in the thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$ and $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime, because it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in the OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the emergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all considered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization changes sign at $h(t)=h*&gt;0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as $h*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of the magnetization is described by a universal function of $\Omega = t/\tau_s$, with $\tau_s = t_s/\ln t_s$.</description>

      <title>Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Complete Boundary Phase Diagram of the Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ Chain with Boundary Fields in the Anti-Ferromagnetic Gapped Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Dissipation engineering of fermionic long-range order beyond Lindblad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. Phys.Rev.Lett. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical excitation and control of excitonic wavepackets in organic molecules is the basis to energy conversion processes. To gain insights into such processes, it is essential to establish the relationship between the coherence timescales of excitons with the electronic inhomogeneity in the molecules, as well as the influence of intermolecular interactions on exciton dynamics. Here, we demonstrate orbital-resolved imaging of optically induced coherent exciton dynamics in single copper napthalocyanine (CuNc) molecules, and selective coherent excitation of dark and bright triplet excitons in coupled molecular dimers. Ultrafast photon-induced tunneling current enabled atomic-scale imaging and control of the excitons in resonantly excited molecules by employing excitonic wavepacket interferometry. Our results reveal an ultrafast exciton coherence time of ~ 70 fs in a single molecule, which decreases for the triplet excitons in interacting molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits using a minimal quasicrystal pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron beams are essential for many applications, yet space-charge interactions in high-intensity beams lead to energy dissipation, coherence loss, and pulse broadening. Existing techniques mitigate these effects by using low-flux beams, preserving beam coherence into the quantum regime. Here, we propose a novel approach by treating the electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas rather than merely as an ensemble of charged point-like particles. We introduce a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, thereby forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs of conduction electrons in superconductors. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), we demonstrate that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the free-electron pairs in a bunched beam, underscoring the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Carpets of Higgs particles in a Supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolids formed from dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) exhibit spontaneous density modulation while maintaining global phase coherence. This state of matter supports gapped amplitude (Higgs) excitations featuring a quadratic dispersion relation. While Higgs modes are typically strongly damped due to coupling with other amplitude and phase modes, imposing an experimentally realistic toroidal geometry allows us to numerically study the time evolution and dispersion of a localized Higgs quasiparticle excitation, with minimal residual coupling to sound modes. Strikingly, the quadratic dispersion leads to the occurrence of (fractional) revivals, similar to those seen in the optical Talbot effect or the so-called quantum carpets. The revival times provide a novel method for determining the effective mass of the Higgs particle through a non-spectroscopic approach. These results pave the way for further studies of coherent Higgs dynamics and mutual interactions between Higgs particles.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>

Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01011v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Tunable negative permeability in a quantum plasmonic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5402</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.5402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the integration of quantum emitters into a negative permeability metamaterial design in order to introduce tunability as well as nonlinear behavior. The unit cell of our metamaterial is a ring of metamolecules, each consisting of a metal nanoparticle and a two-level semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Without the QDs, the ring of the unit cell is known to act as an artificial optical magnetic resonator. By adding the QDs we show that a Fano interference profile is introduced into the magnetic field scattered from the ring. This induced interference is shown to cause an appreciable effect in the collective magnetic resonance of the unit cell. We find that the interference provides a means to tune the response of the negative permeability metamaterial. The exploitation of the QD's inherent nonlinearity is proposed to modulate the metamaterial's magnetic response with a separate control field.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Second Spectral Gap Incompleteness Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.09854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pick a formal system. Any formal system. Whatever your favourite formal system is, as long as it's capable of reasoning about elementary arithmetic. The First Spectral Gap Incompleteness Theorem of [CPGW15] proved that there exist Hamiltonians whose spectral gap is independent of that system; your formal system is incapable of proving that the Hamiltonian is gapped, and equally incapable of proving that it's gapless.
  In this note, I prove a Second Spectral Gap Incompleteness Theorem: I show how to explicitly construct, within the formal system, a concrete example of a Hamiltonian whose spectral gap is independent of that system. Just to be sure, I prove this result three times. Once with G\"odel's help. Once with Zermelo and Fraenkel's help. And finally, doing away with these high-powered friends, I give a simple, direct argument which reveals the inherent self-referential structure at the heart of these results, by asking the Hamiltonian about its own spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Activation of thermal states by coherently controlled thermalization processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization processes degrade the states of any working medium, turning any initial state into a passive state from which no work can be extracted. Recently, it has been shown that this degradation can be avoided if two identical thermalization processes take place in coherently controlled order, in a scenario known as the quantum SWITCH. In some situations, control over the order even enables work extraction when the medium was initially in a passive state. This activation phenomenon, however, is subject to a limitation: to extract non-zero work, the initial temperature of the medium should be less than half of the temperature of the reservoirs. Here we analyze this limitation, showing that it still holds true even when the medium interacts with $N\ge 2$ reservoirs in a coherently-controlled order. Then, we show that the limitation can be lifted when the medium and the control systems are initially correlated. In particular, when the medium and control are entangled, work extraction becomes possible for every initial value of the local temperature of the medium.</description>

      <title>Density matrix representation of hybrid tensor networks for noisy quantum devices</title>

Abstract: The hybrid tensor network (HTN) method is a general framework allowing for the construction of an effective wavefunction with the combination of classical tensors and quantum tensors, i.e., amplitudes of quantum states. In particular, hybrid tree tensor networks (HTTNs) are very useful for simulating larger systems beyond the available size of the quantum hardware. However, while the realistic quantum states in NISQ hardware are highly likely to be noisy, this framework is formulated for pure states. In this work, as well as discussing the relevant methods, i.e., Deep VQE and entanglement forging under the framework of HTTNs, we investigate the noisy HTN states by introducing the expansion operator for providing the description of the expansion of the size of simulated quantum systems and the noise propagation. This framework enables the general tree HTN states to be explicitly represented and their physicality to be discussed. We also show that the expectation value of a measured observable exponentially vanishes with the number of contracted quantum tensors. Our work will lead to providing the noise-resilient construction of HTN states.</description>

      <title>Scheme for continuous force detection with a single electron at the level of $10^{-27}\ \mathrm{N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of weak forces is a central problem in physics and engineering, ranging in importance from fundamental pursuits such as precision tests of gravity, gravitational-wave detection, and searches for dark matter, to applications such as force microscopy. These pursuits require a low-mass mechanical force transducer with a high quality factor, whose motion can be measured in a quantum-noise-limited manner. Here we study the ultimate example of such a transducer: a single trapped electron. We propose and analyze in detail a new scheme for high-sensitivity continuous force detection using a single trapped electron whose motion is coupled to a microwave cavity field via image currents induced in an antenna. We derive the fundamental and technical limits to the sensitivity of this scheme and show that despite the disparity in size between that of a single electron and the wavelength of the microwave field, it is possible to continuously monitor the charge's zero-point motion and use it as a force detector with a sensitivity as low as $6\times 10^{-27}\ \mathrm{N} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the gigahertz regime. This sensitivity improves on the state-of-the-art by four orders of magnitude and thus paves the way to novel precision experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region, are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.</description>

Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial quantum superposition with a nanoparticle has a multitude of applications, ranging from testing the foundations of quantum mechanics, matter-wave interferometer for detecting gravitational waves and probing the electromagnetic vacuum, dark matter detection and quantum sensors to testing the quantum nature of gravity in a lab. In this paper, we investigate the role of rotation in a matter-wave interferometer, where we show that imparting angular momentum along the direction of a defect, such as one present in the nitrogen-vacancy centre of a nanodiamond can cause an enhancement in spin contrast for a wide-ranging value of the angular momentum, e.g. $10^{3}-10^{6}$~Hz for a mass of order $10^{-14}-10^{-17}$ Kg nanodiamond. Furthermore, the imparted angular momentum can enhance the spatial superposition by almost a factor of two and possibly average out any potential permanent dipoles in the nanodiamond.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford diagonalization for measurement shot reduction in quantum expectation value estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating expectation values on near-term quantum computers often requires a prohibitively large number of measurements. One widely-used strategy to mitigate this problem has been to partition an operator's Pauli terms into sets of mutually commuting operators. Here, we introduce a method that relaxes this constraint of commutativity, instead allowing for entirely arbitrary terms to be grouped together, save a locality constraint. The key idea is that we decompose the operator into arbitrary tensor products with bounded tensor size, ignoring Pauli commuting relations. This method -- named $k$-NoCliD ($k$-local non-Clifford diagonalization) -- allows one to measure in far fewer bases in most cases, often (though not always) at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We introduce several partitioning algorithms tailored to different Hamiltonian classes. For electronic structure, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold values of $k$ for which $k$-NoCliD leads to the lowest shot counts, though we leave improved partitioning algorithms to future work. We focus primarily on three Hamiltonian classes -- molecular vibrational structure, Fermi-Hubbard, and Bose-Hubbard -- and show that $k$-NoCliD reduces the number of circuit shots, often by a very large margin, and often even for $k$ as small as 2.</description>

Abstract: The most important characteristic of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is its security against third-party attacks, and the potential countermeasures available. While new types of attacks are regularly developed in the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement and more specifically machine learning to infer the qubit states. In this paper, we design a new individual attack scheme called \textit{Deep-learning-based continuous attack} (DLCA) that exploits continuous measurement together with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent neural networks. We show that, when applied to the BB84 protocol, our attack increases only slightly the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) of a noisy channel and allows the spy to infer a significant part of the sifted key. In addition, we show it yields similar performances in terms of information gain when compared to an optimal individual attack, namely the phase-covariant quantum cloner. Our individual attack scheme demonstrates deep-learning-enhanced quantum state tomography applied to QKD and could be generalized in many different ways,</description>

      <title>Visualizing Dynamics of Charges and Strings in (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. Here, we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent excitations and string dynamics.</description>

      <title>The controlled exciton transport of the Multi-chain system by cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings</title>

Abstract: The performance of various quantum devices is fundamentally linked to the control of exciton transport. To explore this, we study the exciton transport of the two-dimensional multi-chain systems with different coupling configurations in an optical cavity. Two types of the chains--the homogeneous and heterogeneous coupling chain, as well as two inter-chain coupling conformations--the square and triangular arrangements, are considered. The effects of the inter-chain coupling, the dimerization parameter, the cavity, the length and number of the chains on exciton transport are systematically investigated for different coupling configurations through the spectra, the Hopfield coeffcients, and the steady-state dynamics of the system. The results show that in the absence of a cavity the exciton transport currents and effciency are determined by the exciton distribution across the multi-chain system. However, when a cavity is introduced the exciton transport can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by the polariton formation at the cavity-dressed energy level crossings and anticrossings near zero-energy modes, where the coherent excitation and LandauZener transitions occur. Meanwhile, we discover that the discontinuous and extremal points in the second-order partial derivatives of the photon Hopfield coeffcients with respect to the inter-chain coupling and the dimerization parameter correspond respectively to the crossings and anticrossings at the extreme points of the photon occupation number. Additionally, exciton transport effciency is closely related to the odevity of both chain length and chain number, and exhibits oscillatory behaviour. This work provides critical insights into the exciton transport mechanism in multichain-cavity system and theoretical basis for designing high-erformance excitonic devices with tunable transport properties.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Classical and Quantum Approach to Deterministic L-System Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L-systems can be made to model and create simulations of many biological processes, such as plant development. Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-systems) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grover's quantum algorithm can find a marked item from an unstructured database faster than any classical algorithm, and hence it has been used for several applications such as cryptanalysis and optimization. When there exist multiple marked items, Grover's algorithm has the property of finding one of them uniformly at random. To further broaden the application range, it was generalized so that it finds marked items with probabilities according to their priority by encoding the priority into amplitudes applied by Grover's oracle operator. In this paper, to achieve a similar generalization, we examine a different encoding that incorporates the priority into phases applied by the oracle operator. We compare the previous and our oracle operators and observe that which one performs better depends on priority parameters. Since the priority parameters can be considered as the magnitude of the correlated phase error on Grover's oracle operator, the analysis of our oracle operator also reveals the robustness of the original Grover's algorithm against correlated noises. We further numerically show that the coherence between multiple marked items tends to increase the probability of finding the most prioritized one in Grover's algorithm with our oracle operator.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</description>

      <title>Strong and noise-tolerant entanglement in dissipative optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09541v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic entanglement, as a critical quantum resource in quantum information science, has been extensively studied in coherent optomechanics over the past decades. However, entanglement in dissipative optomechanics, where the cavity linewidth depends on the position of the mechanical resonator, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement in a dissipative optomechanical system realized by a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer with a movable membrane. This configuration enables the switching between coherent and dissipative optomechanical couplings at will. With experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the steady-state mechanical displacement exhibits a nonlinear (linear) dependence on the driving power under coherent (dissipative) coupling. Furthermore, we show that the quantum entanglement generated via dissipative coupling is significantly stronger and more robust to noise than that generated via coherent coupling. When both coherent and dissipative couplings are simultaneously present, the entanglement is weakened due to quantum interference. Our results indicate that dissipative optomechanical coupling can be a promising route for engineering strong and noise-resilient quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of Sensitivity to Structured Uncertainties in Spintronic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric model of the differential sensitivity of the fidelity error for state transfer in a spintronic network based on the relationship between a set of matrix operators. We show an explicit dependence of the differential sensitivity on the fidelity (error), and we further demonstrate that this dependence does not require a trade-off between the fidelity and sensitivity. Rather, we prove that for closed systems, ideal performance in the sense of perfect state transfer is both necessary and sufficient for optimal robustness in terms of vanishing sensitivity. We demonstrate the utility of this geometric interpretation of the sensitivity by applying the model to explain the sensitivity versus fidelity error data in two examples.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Reinforcement Learning with a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.</description>

      <title>Ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning with Heisenberg-limited scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the unknown interactions that govern a quantum system is crucial for quantum information processing, device benchmarking, and quantum sensing. The problem, known as Hamiltonian learning, is well understood under the assumption that interactions are local, but this assumption may not hold for arbitrary Hamiltonians. Previous methods all require high-order inverse polynomial dependency with precision, unable to surpass the standard quantum limit and reach the gold standard Heisenberg-limited scaling. Whether Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning is possible without prior assumptions about the interaction structures, a challenge we term \emph{ansatz-free Hamiltonian learning}, remains an open question. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm to learn arbitrary sparse Hamiltonians without any structure constraints using only black-box queries of the system's real-time evolution and minimal digital controls to attain Heisenberg-limited scaling in estimation error. Our method is also resilient to state-preparation-and-measurement errors, enhancing its practical feasibility. We numerically demonstrate our ansatz-free protocol for learning physical Hamiltonians and validating analog quantum simulations, benchmarking our performance against the state-of-the-art Heisenberg-limited learning approach. Moreover, we establish a fundamental trade-off between total evolution time and quantum control on learning arbitrary interactions, revealing the intrinsic interplay between controllability and total evolution time complexity for any learning algorithm. These results pave the way for further exploration into Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning in complex quantum systems under minimal assumptions, potentially enabling new benchmarking and verification protocols.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. Stabilizer codes, including surface code and color code, have long been the focus of research and have seen significant experimental progress in recent years. Recently proposed time-dynamical QEC, including Floquet codes and generalized time-dynamical code implementations, opens up new opportunities for FT quantum computation. By employing a periodic schedule of low-weight parity checks, Floquet codes can generate additional dynamical logical qubits, offering enhanced error correction capabilities and potentially higher code performance. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states, and stabilize these states using repeated error detection. We showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. Furthermore, by implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for resource-efficient FT quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how finite-temperature corrections and spin-dependent/independent noise will affect the contrast in a matter-wave interferometer, especially with massive objects and large spatial superposition sizes. Typically, spin is embedded in a nanoparticle as a defect, which can be manipulated by the external magnetic field to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. These massive matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, macroscopic quantum superposition can use entanglement features to, e.g., test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. We will consider a Stern-Gerlach type apparatus to create macroscopic quantum superposition in a harmonic oscillator trap, and figure out the spin contrast loss due to linear spin-independent and spin-dependent noise in a single interferometer. We will show that spin contrast loss due to spin-independent noise does not depend on the initial thermal state of the matter wave function. However, spin contrast loss due to spin-dependent fluctuations do depend on the initial thermal occupation of the quantum state. We will keep our discussion general as far as the noise parameters are concerned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving unit fidelity in quantum state preparation is often impossible in the presence of environmental decoherence. While continuous monitoring and feedback control can improve fidelity, perfect state preparation remains elusive in many scenarios. Inspired by quantum speed limits, we derive a fundamental bound on the steady-state average fidelity achievable via continuous monitoring and feedback control. This bound depends only on the unconditional Lindblad dynamics, the Hamiltonian variance, and the target state. We also adapt the bound to the case of Markovian feedback strategies. We then focus on preparing Dicke states in an atomic ensemble subject to collective damping and dispersive coupling. By imposing additional constraints on control Hamiltonians and monitoring strategies, we derive tighter fidelity bounds. Finally, we propose specific control strategies and validate them using reinforcement learning. Benchmarking their performance against our theoretical bounds highlights the relevance and usefulness of these bounds in characterizing quantum feedback control strategies.</description>

Abstract: When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework called spacetime concatenation for fault-tolerant compilation of syndrome extraction circuits of stabilizer codes. Spacetime concatenation enables efficient compilation of syndrome extraction circuits into dynamical codes through structured gadget layouts and encoding matrices, facilitating low-weight measurements while preserving logical information. Our framework uses conditions that are sufficient for fault-tolerance of the dynamical code, including not measuring logical operators and preserving the spacetime distance. We construct explicit examples of dynamical codes using this framework, including the dynamical bivariate bicycle code and a dynamical Haah code, while illustrating their fault-tolerant properties. Furthermore, we analyze the classification and resource trade-offs of dynamical codes, demonstrating their adaptability to hardware constraints, including fabrication defects and qubit dropout scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we model the temperature measurement as a transformation of the arbitrary state into the Gibbs state. We start with a general formalism of ansatz-posteriors, which includes many usual models of posterior states due to measurement or state preparation. On the one hand, it contains models of selective and non-selective measurements posteriors as special cases, which allows us to consider it as a generalization of usual measurement models. On the other hand, it contains the above mentioned transformation into the Gibbs state as a special case as well. We derive an analogue of the master equation in the stroboscopic limit of repeated measurements. Then we apply our general approach to temperature measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently developed novel approaches, mimicking the synapses of the human brain to achieve similarly efficient learning strategies. Such an approach retains the universality of standard methods, while attempting to circumvent their excessive requirements, which hinder their scalability. In this landscape, quantum (or quantum inspired) algorithms may bring enhancement. However, high-performing neural networks invariably display nonlinear behaviours, which poses a challenge to quantum platforms, given the intrinsically linear evolution of closed systems. We propose a strategy to enhance the nonlinearity achievable in this context, without resorting to entangling gates and report the first neuromorphic architecture based on a photonic quantum memristor. In detail, we show how the memristive feedback loop enhances the nonlinearity and hence the performance of the tested algorithms. We benchmark our model on four tasks, a nonlinear function and three time series prediction. In these cases, we highlight the essential role of the quantum memristive element and demonstrate the possibility of using it as a building block in more sophisticated networks.</description>

      <title>Parity-Time Symmetric Spin-1/2 Richardson-Gaudin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the integrable $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model for spin-$1/2$ particles in an arbitrary magnetic field. First, we define the parity and time-reversal transformation rules and determine the metric operator as well as the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric inner product. Using the metric operator, we derive the Hermitian counterparts of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric conserved charges. We then compute and plot the eigenvalues of the conserved charges obtained from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model. As expected for any $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, the spectrum exhibits both real eigenvalues and complex-conjugate pairs. We numerically study the spin dynamics of this model and compare it with the Hermitian case in both closed and open quantum systems. Our findings reveal that, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model, the system fails to reach a steady state at weak coupling, demonstrating robustness against dissipation. However, at stronger coupling strengths, the system eventually reaches a steady state after some time. Finally, we investigate the perturbation theory of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin Hamiltonian, assuming that the magnetic fields in the $x$- and $y$-directions are much smaller in magnitude than the magnetic field in the $z$-direction.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum metrology under energy constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology promises enhanced precision in parameter estimation by exploiting quantum effects. The traditional framework of metrology commonly assumes unlimited access to resources, overlooking resource constraints in realistic scenarios. As such, the optimal strategies therein are often infeasible in practice. Here, we investigate quantum metrology where the total energy consumption of the probe state preparation, intermediate control operations, and the final measurement is subject to an energy constraint. We establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for characterizing energy-constrained quantum multi-step processes, which can be applied to other tasks of quantum information processing beyond metrology. Based on the framework, we develop a general optimization method for energy-constrained quantum metrology that determines the optimal precision as well as the corresponding optimal strategy. Applying our method to phase estimation, we show that while the estimation precision can benefit arbitrarily from increasing dimension with unconstrained energy, energy constraints result in an ultimate precision scaling of $1/E^2$ in an infinite-dimensional system, where $E$ is the available energy, which reveals that limited energy could be an essential barrier to precision improvement.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling bounds and scalable partitioning for quantum circuit cutting beyond bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for identifying cutting locations for quantum circuit cutting, with a primary focus on partitioning circuits into three or more parts. Under the assumption that the classical postprocessing function is decomposable, we derive a new upper bound on the sampling overhead resulting from both time-like and space-like cuts. We show that this bound improves upon the previously known bound by orders of magnitude in cases of three or more partitions. Based on this bound, we formulate an objective function, $L_Q^{}$, and present a method to determine cutting locations that minimize it. Our method is shown to outperform a previous approach in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the obtained partitioning is found to be comparable to or better than that of the baseline in all but a few cases, as measured by $L_Q^{}$. These results are obtained by identifying cutting locations in a number of benchmark circuits of the size and type expected in quantum computations that outperform classical computers.</description>

      <title>Improved energy barrier in higher-dimensional hypergraph product codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot error correction outperform conventional approaches by requiring only one round of stabilizer measurements for decoding, even in the presence of measurement errors. This capability relates to the confinement property of codes, which provides an energy barrier lower bound. Earlier research established a confinement property for higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HHGP) codes (Quintavalle et al. 2021 PRX Quantum), yielding an energy barrier lower bound for these codes. In this work, by analyzing the structure of logical operators, we show an improved energy barrier lower bound for HHGP codes with low-density parity-check (LDPC) property. Our bound exceeds results derived from confinement alone, and unlike standard hypergraph product codes, these higher dimensional variants can possess macroscopic energy barriers even when the underlying classical codes lack this property. Specifically, our analysis shows that the energy barrier of LDPC HHGP codes is lower bounded by the distance of the underlying classical codes. This bound is tight if the underlying classical codes exhibit system size-dependent distances but constant energy barriers, like 3D and 4D toric codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of a quantum sequence alignment (QSA) algorithm on biological data in environments simulating noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The approach to quantum bioinformatics adapts the original QSA algorithm proposed in 2000 to current capabilities and limitations of NISQ-era quantum computers and uses a genetic algorithm for state preparation (GASP) to create encoding circuits to load both database and target sequences into the quantum data registers. The implementation is tested in a simulated quantum computer environment to validate the approach and refine the GASP data-loading circuit designs. The results demonstrate the practicalities of deploying the QSA algorithm and exemplify the potential of GASP for data encoding in the realm of quantum circuit design, particularly for complex algorithms in quantum bioinformatics and other data-rich problems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Topology in a Single-Atom Synthetic Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected. To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice, we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from classical analogs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

      <title>How to realize compact and non-compact localized states in disorder-free hypercube networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for realizing various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moir\'e lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here, we demonstrate that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states naturally emerge in disorder-free hypercubes, which can be systematically constructed using Cartan products. This construction ensures the robustness of these localized states against perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the hypercubes can be associated with the Fock space of interacting spin systems exhibiting localization. Viewing localization from the hypercube perspective, with its inherently simple eigenspace structure, offers a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the underlying Fock-space many-body localization phenomena. Our findings can be readily tested on existing experimental platforms, where hypercube graphs can be emulated, e.g., by photonic networks of coupled optical cavities or waveguides. The results can pave the way for the development of novel quantum information protocols and enable effective simulation of quantum many-body localization phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the low-energy properties of binary superfluids with density-dependent interactions. Adding an intra-species coupling that induces an explicit soft symmetry-breaking, we determine the background pressure and we show that the low-energy spectrum consists of a massless Nambu- Goldstone boson and a massive (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson. When the background velocities of the two superfluids are transonic, the system is characterized by two distinct acoustic horizons: the hydrodynamic analogue of the black hole event horizon. The Hawking-like emission occurring at these horizons produces an effective friction on the fluids. We compute the viscosity-to-entropy ratios close to the two acoustic horizons, finding that the emission of pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons violates the bound conjectured by Kovtun, Son and Starinet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition from a false vacuum to the true vacuum is a real-time phenomenon of interest in many contexts. It represents a special challenge for strongly interacting non-Abelian gauge theories because standard spacetime lattices incorporate imaginary time from the outset. To attain real-time phenomena, Hamiltonian lattice methods are being developed for quantum computers. The present work considers SU(2) gauge theory on a minimal lattice in three spatial dimensions, where round-the-world strings called torelons can travel and interact. This minimal 3D lattice has a triamond structure whose properties are elucidated by calculating the spectrum of torelon states. Then, by introducing a twisted boundary condition, real-time evolution is used to demonstrate the decay of a false vacuum. Calculations in the present work are done on classical computers except for one benchmark study of imaginary time evolution that ran on the ibm_brisbane quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>
