Abstract: We find the area between $\cos^p x$ and $\cos^p nx$ as $n$ heads to infinity, and we establish a connection between these limiting values and the exponential generating function for $\arcsin x/(1-x)$ at sequence number A296726 on the OEIS.</description>

      <title>An improved integrality gap for disjoint cycles in planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new greedy rounding algorithm for the Cycle Packing Problem for uncrossable cycle families in planar graphs. This improves the best-known upper bound for the integrality gap of the natural packing LP to a constant slightly less than 3.5. Furthermore, the analysis works for both edge- and vertex-disjoint packing. The previously best-known constants were 4 for edge-disjoint and 5 for vertex-disjoint cycle packing. This result also immediately yields an improved Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa ratio: for any uncrossable cycle family in a planar graph, the minimum number of vertices (edges) needed to hit all cycles in the family is less than 8.38 times the maximum number of vertex-disjoint (edge-disjoint, respectively) cycles in the family.
  Some uncrossable cycle families of interest to which the result can be applied are the family of all cycles in a directed or undirected graph, in undirected graphs also the family of all odd cycles and the family of all cycles containing exactly one edge from a specified set of demand edges. The last example is an equivalent formulation of the fully planar Disjoint Paths Problem. Here the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa ratio translates to a ratio between integral multi-commodity flows and minimum cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we provide Steinerberger curvature formulas for block graphs, discuss curvature relations between two graphs and the graph obtained by connecting them via a bridge, and show that self-centered Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs are precisely those which are antipodal. We also discuss similarities and differences between Steinerberger and Ollivier Ricci curvature results.</description>

      <title>Superspace coinvariants and hyperplane arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be the {\em superspace ring} of polynomial-valued differential forms on affine $n$-space. The natural action of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on $n$-space induces an action of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on $\Omega$. The {\em superspace coinvariant ring} is the quotient $SR$ of $\Omega$ by the ideal generated by $\mathfrak{S}_n$-invariants with vanishing constant term. We give the first explicit basis of $SR$, proving a conjecture of Sagan and Swanson. Our techniques use the theory of hyperplane arrangements. We relate $SR$ to instances of the Solomon-Terao algebras of Abe-Maeno-Murai-Numata and use exact sequences relating the derivation modules of certain `southwest closed' arrangements to obtain the desired basis of $SR$.</description>

      <title>Stability for binary scalar products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bohn, Faenza, Fiorini, Fisikopoulos, Macchia, and Pashkovich (2015) conjectured that 2-level polytopes cannot simultaneously have many vertices and many facets, namely, that the maximum of the product of the number of vertices and facets is attained on the cube and cross-polytope. This was proved in a recent work by Kupavskii and Weltge. In this paper, we resolve a strong version of the conjecture by Bohn et al., and find the maximum possible product of the number of vertices and the number of facets in a 2-level polytope that is not affinely isomorphic to the cube or the cross-polytope. To do this, we get a sharp stability result of Kupavskii and Weltge's upper bound on $\left|\mathcal A\right|\cdot\left|\mathcal B\right|$ for $\mathcal A,\mathcal B \subseteq \mathbb R^d$ with a property that $\forall a \in \mathcal A, b \in \mathcal B$ the scalar product $\langle a, b\rangle \in\{0,1\}$.</description>

      <title>From the Lyndon factorization to the Canonical Inverse Lyndon factorization: back and forth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of inverse Lyndon word is related to the classical notion of Lyndon word. More precisely, inverse Lyndon words are all and only the nonempty prefixes of the powers of the anti-Lyndon words, where an anti-Lyndon word with respect to a lexicographical order is a classical Lyndon word with respect to the inverse lexicographic order. Each word $w$ admits a factorization in inverse Lyndon words, named the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization $\ICFL(w)$, which maintains the main properties of the Lyndon factorization of $w$. Although there is a huge literature on the Lyndon factorization, the relation between the Lyndon factorization $\CFL_{in}$ with respect to the inverse order and the canonical inverse Lyndon factorization $\ICFL$ has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we address this question and we show how to obtain one factorization from the other via the notion of grouping. This result naturally opens new insights in the investigation of the relationship between $\ICFL$ and other notions, e.g., variants of Burrows Wheeler Transform, as already done for the Lyndon factorization.</description>

      <title>Layered subgraphs of the hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subgraph of the $n$-dimensional hypercube is called 'layered' if it is a subgraph of a layer of some hypercube. In this paper we show that there exist subgraphs of the cube of arbitrarily large girth that are not layered. This answers a question of Axenovich, Martin and Winter. Perhaps surprisingly, these subgraphs may even be taken to be induced.</description>

      <title>Construction of local antimagic 3-colorable graphs of fixed even size -- matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge labeling of a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be local antimagic if it is a bijection $f:E \to\{1,\ldots ,|E|\}$ such that for any pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$, $f^+(x)\not= f^+(y)$, where the induced vertex label $f^+(x)= \sum f(e)$, with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident to $x$. The local antimagic chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{la}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex labels over all local antimagic labelings of $G$. Suppose $\chi_{la}(G)=\chi_{la}(H)$ and $G_H$ is obtained from $G$ and $H$ by merging some vertices of $G$ with some vertices of $H$ bijectively. In this paper, we give ways to construct matrices with integers in $[1,10k]$, $k\ge 1$, that meet certain properties. Consequently, we obtained many families of (disconnected) bipartite (and tripartite) graphs of size $10k$ with local antimagic chromatic number 3.</description>

      <title>Difference graphs of finite abelian groups with two Sylow subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph and the enhanced power graph of a group $\mathbf G$ are simple graphs with vertex set $G$; two elements of $G$ are adjacent in the power graph if one of them is a power of the other, and they are adjacent in the enhanced power graph if they generate a cyclic subgroup. The difference graph of a group $\mathbf G$, denoted by $\mathcal D(\mathbf G)$, is the difference of the enhanced power graph and the power graph of group $\mathbf G$ with all the isolated vertices removed. In this paper, we prove that, if a pair of finite abelian groups of order divisible by at most two primes have isomorphic difference graphs, then they are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>An extended generalization of RSK via the combinatorics of type $A$ quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence is a bijection from nonnegative integer matrices to pairs of semi-standard Young tableaux. Based on the work of, among others, Burge, Hillman, Grassl, Knuth and Gansner, it is known that a version of this correspondence gives, for any nonzero integer partition $\lambda$, a bijection from arbitrary fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda$, via Greene--Kleitman invariants. By bringing out the combinatorial aspects of our recent results on quiver representations, we construct a family of bijections from fillings of $\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions of shape $\lambda$ parametrized by a choice of Coxeter element in a suitable symmetric group. We recover the above version of the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence for a particular choice of Coxeter element depending on $\lambda$.</description>

Abstract: Define a queen on $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ with admissible moves parallel to $\mathbf{x}\in\{-1,0,1\}^d$ at arbitrary length. How many queens can be placed on $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ without any two in conflict? We improve a 1918 result by P\'{o}lya on the torus board $\mathbf{Z}_n^2$ while deducing an exact answer whenever $n\le 15$. Moreover, we give an example of $(n-c)n^{d-2}$ independent queens on $\mathbf{Z}_n^d$, where $c(2)=4$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing random graphs from distance queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the minimum number of distance queries that is sufficient to reconstruct the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ with constant diameter with high probability. We get a tight (up to a constant factor) answer for all $p&gt;n^{-1+o(1)}$ outside "threshold windows" around $n^{-k/(k+1)+o(1)}$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$: with high probability the query complexity equals $\Theta(n^{4-d}p^{2-d})$, where $d$ is the diameter of the random graph. This demonstrates the following non-monotone behaviour: the query complexity jumps down at moments when the diameter gets larger; yet, between these moments the query complexity grows. We also show that there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that reconstructs the random graph with $O(n^{4-d}p^{2-d}\ln n)$ distance queries with high probability, and this is best possible.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Representations of Interventional Characteristic Imset Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic imsets are 0/1-vectors representing directed acyclic graphs whose edges represent direct cause-effect relations between jointly distributed random variables. A characteristic imset (CIM) polytope is the convex hull of a collection of characteristic imsets. CIM polytopes arise as feasible regions of a linear programming approach to the problem of causal disovery, which aims to infer a cause-effect structure from data. Linear optimization methods typically require a hyperplane representation of the feasible region, which has proven difficult to compute for CIM polytopes despite continued efforts. We solve this problem for CIM polytopes that are the convex hull of imsets associated to DAGs whose underlying graph of adjacencies is a tree. Our methods use the theory of toric fiber products as well as the novel notion of interventional CIM polytopes. Our solution is obtained as a corollary of a more general result for interventional CIM polytopes. The identified hyperplanes are applied to yield a linear optimization-based causal discovery algorithm for learning polytree causal networks from a combination of observational and interventional data.</description>

      <title>Distributions of statistics on separable permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive functional equations for distributions of six classical statistics (ascents, descents, left-to-right maxima, right-to-left maxima, left-to-right minima, and right-to-left minima) on separable and irreducible separable permutations. The equations are used to find a third degree equation for joint distribution of ascents and descents on separable permutations that generalizes the respective known result for the descent distribution. Moreover, our general functional equations allow us to derive explicitly (joint) distribution of any subset of maxima and minima statistics on irreducible, reducible and all separable permutations. In particular, there are two equivalence classes of distributions of a pair of maxima or minima statistics. Finally, we present three unimodality conjectures about distributions of statistics on separable permutations.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Sombor energy of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with vertex set $V(G) = \{v_1, v_2,\ldots, v_n\}$. The elliptic Sombor matrix of $G$, denoted by $A_{ESO}(G)$, is defined as the $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is $(d_i+d_j)\sqrt{d_i^2+d_j^2}$ if $v_i$ and $v_j$ are adjacent and $0$ for another cases. Let the eigenvalues of the elliptic Sombor matrix $A_{ESO}(G)$ be $\rho_1\geq \rho_2\geq \ldots\geq \rho_n$ which are the roots of the elliptic Sombor characteristic polynomial $\prod_{i=1}^n (\rho-\rho_i)$. The elliptic Sombor energy ${E_{ESO}}$ of $G$ is the sum of absolute values of the eigenvalues of $A_{ESO}(G)$. In this paper, we compute the elliptic Sombor characteristic polynomial and the elliptic Sombor energy for some graph classes. We compute the elliptic Sombor energy of cubic graphs of order $10$ and as a consequence, we see that two $k$-regular graphs of the same order may have different elliptic Sombor energy.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and real-world RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive stacked bonds frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in real-world RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in real-world secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Generating Functions Enumerating Non-Bonding Dominoes on Rectangular Boards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript studies configurations of non-overlapping non-bonding dominoes on finite rectangular boards of unit squares characterized by row and column number. The non-bonding dominoes are defined here by the requirement that any domino on the board shares at most one point (one of its four corner points) with any other domino, but no edge. With the Transfer Matrix Method, rational generating functions are derived that solve the enumeration problem entirely, here evaluated for boards with up to six rows or columns.</description>

      <title>Degeneration in discrimintal arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discriminantal arrangements are hyperplane arrangements, which are generalized braid ones. They are constructed from given hyperplane arrangements, but their combinatorics are not invariant under combinatorial equivalence. However, it is known that the combinatorics of the discriminantal arrangement are constant on a Zariski open set of the space of hyperplane arrangements. In the present paper, we introduce non-very generic varieties in the space of hyperplane arrangements to classify discriminantal arrangements and show that the Zariski open set is the complement of non-very generic varieties. We study their basic properties and construction and provide examples, including infinite families of non-very generic varieties. In particular, the construction we call degeneration is a powerful tool for constructing non-very generic varieties. As an application, we provide lists of non-very generic varieties for spaces of small line arrangements.</description>

      <title>On the uncommonness of minimal rank-2 systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that suitably generic pairs of linear equations on an even number of variables are uncommon. This verifies a conjecture of Kam\v{c}ev, Morrison and the second author. Moreover, we prove that any large system containing such a $(2\times k)$-system as a minimal subsystem is uncommon.</description>

      <title>Approximation and FPT Algorithms for Finding DM-Irreducible Spanning Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a minimum strongly connected spanning subgraph of a given directed graph generalizes the well-known strong connectivity augmentation problem, and it is NP-hard. For the weighted problem, a simple $2$-approximation algorithm was proposed by Frederickson and J\'{a}j\'{a} (1981); surprisingly, it still achieves the best known approximation ratio in general. Also, the unweighted problem was shown to be FPT by Bang-Jensen and Yeo (2008), where the parameter is the difference from the trivial upper bound of the optimal value. In this paper, we consider a generalized problem related to the Dulmage--Mendelsohn decompositions of bipartite graphs instead of the strong connectivity of directed graphs, and extend the above approximation and FPT results to this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the proper amalgam of matroids $M_1$ and $M_2$ along their common restriction $N$ exists if and only if the tropical fibre product of Bergman fans ${B(M_1) \times_{B(N)} B(M_2)}$ is positive. We introduce tropical correspondences between Bergman fans as tropical subcycles in their product, similar to correspondences in algebraic geometry, and define a "graph correspondence" of the map of lattices. We prove that graph construction is a functor for the "covering" maps of lattices, exploiting a generalization of Bergman fan which we call a "Flag fan".</description>

      <title>A Note on Asynchronous Challenges: Unveiling Formulaic Bias and Data Loss in the Hayashi-Yoshida Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hayashi-Yoshida (\HY)-estimator exhibits an intrinsic, telescoping property that leads to an often overlooked computational bias, which we denote,formulaic or intrinsic bias. This formulaic bias results in data loss by cancelling out potentially relevant data points, the nonextant data points. This paper attempts to formalize and quantify the data loss arising from this bias. In particular, we highlight the existence of nonextant data points via a concrete example, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the telescoping property to induce this type of formulaic bias.Since this type of bias is nonexistent when inputs, i.e., observation times, $\Pi^{(1)} :=(t_i^{(1)})_{i=0,1,\ldots}$ and $\Pi^{(2)} :=(t_j^{(2)})_{j=0,1,\ldots}$, are synchronous, we introduce the (a,b)-asynchronous adversary. This adversary generates inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$ according to two independent homogenous Poisson processes with rates a&gt;0 and b&gt;0, respectively. We address the foundational questions regarding cumulative minimal (or least) average data point loss, and determine the values for a and b. We prove that for equal rates a=b, the minimal average cumulative data loss over both inputs is attained and amounts to 25\%. We present an algorithm, which is based on our theorem, for computing the exact number of nonextant data points given inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$, and suggest alternative methods. Finally, we use simulated data to empirically compare the (cumulative) average data loss of the (\HY)-estimator.</description>

Abstract: Kaneko and Tsumura proved a relation of multiple $\tilde{T}$-values involving Entringer numbers counting the total number of down-up permutations starting with a fixed value. In the present paper, we generalize this relation and provide some relations involving Entringer numbers and the total number of Dumont permutations of the first kind starting with a fixed value. For this purpose, we also provide explicit formulas for the total numbers of those permutations.</description>

      <title>Graph Search Trees and the Intermezzo Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last in-tree recognition problem asks whether a given spanning tree can be derived by connecting each vertex with its rightmost left neighbor of some search ordering. In this study, we demonstrate that the last-in-tree recognition problem for Generic Search is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. We utilize this finding to strengthen a complexity result from order theory. Given partial order $\pi$ and a set of triples, the $\mathsf{NP}$-complete intermezzo problem asks for a linear extension of $\pi$ where each first element of a triple is not between the other two. We show that this problem remains $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even when the Hasse diagram of the partial order forms a tree of bounded height. In contrast, we give an $\mathsf{XP}$ algorithm for the problem when parameterized by the width of the partial order. Furthermore, we show that $\unicode{x2013}$ under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ the running time of this algorithm is asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05535v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Manjul Bhargava's theory of generalized factorials, Fedor Petrov and the author have defined the "Bhargava greedoid" -- a greedoid (a matroid-like set system on a finite set) assigned to any "ultra triple" (a somewhat extended variant of a finite ultrametric space). Here we show that the Bhargava greedoid of a finite ultra triple is always a "Gaussian elimination greedoid" over any sufficiently large (e.g., infinite) field; this is a greedoid analogue of a representable matroid. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of the field to ensure this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ is \emph{overfull} if $|E(G)|&gt;\Delta \lfloor |V(G)|/2\rfloor$. The \emph{core} of $G$, denoted $G_{\Delta}$, is the subgraph of $G$ induced by its vertices of degree $\Delta$. Clearly, the chromatic index of $G$ equals $\Delta+1$ if $G$ is overfull. Conversely, Hilton and Zhao in 1996 conjectured that if $G$ is a simple connected graph with $\Delta\ge 3$ and $\Delta(G_\Delta)\le 2$, then $\chi'(G)=\Delta+1$ implies that $G$ is overfull or $G=P^*$, where $P^*$ is obtained from the Petersen graph by deleting a vertex (Core Conjecture). The goal of this paper is to develop the concepts of ``pseudo-multifan'' and ``lollipop'' and study their properties in an edge colored graph. These concepts turn out to be powerful tools in edge coloring graphs with a small core degree.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of proper elements to all Coxeter groups. For all infinite families of finite Coxeter groups we prove that the probability a random element is proper goes to zero in the limit. This proves a conjecture of the third author and A.

We also enumerate the proper elements in the exceptional Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>The monopole-dimer model on Cartesian products of plane graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monopole-dimer model is a signed variant of the monomer-dimer model which has determinantal structure. We extend the monopole-dimer model for planar graphs (Math. Phys. Anal. Geom., 2015) to Cartesian products thereof and show that the partition function of this model can be expressed as a determinant of a generalised signed adjacency matrix. We then show that the partition function is independent of the orientations of the planar graphs so long as the orientations are Pfaffian. When these planar graphs are bipartite, we show that the computation of the partition function becomes especially simple. We then give an explicit product formula for the partition function of three-dimensional grid graphs a la Kasteleyn and Temperley--Fischer, which turns out to be fourth power of a polynomial when all grid lengths are even. Finally, we generalise this product formula to $d$ dimensions, again obtaining an explicit product formula. We conclude with a discussion on asymptotic formulas for the free energy and monopole densities.</description>

      <title>$2$-polarity and algorithmic aspects of polarity variants on cograph superclasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be an $(s, k)$-polar graph if its vertex set admits a partition $(A, B)$ such that $A$ and $B$ induce, respectively, a complete $s$-partite graph and the disjoint union of at most $k$ complete graphs. Polar graphs and monopolar graphs are defined as $(\infty, \infty)$- and $(1, \infty)$-polar graphs, respectively, and unipolar graphs are those graphs with a polar partition $(A, B)$ such that $A$ is a clique.
  The problems of deciding whether an arbitrary graph is a polar graph or a monopolar graph are known to be NP-complete. In contrast, deciding whether a graph is a unipolar graph can be done in polynomial time. In this work we prove that the three previous problems can be solved in linear time on the classes of $P_4$-sparse and $P_4$-extendible graphs, generalizing analogous results previously known for cographs.
  Additionally, we provide finite forbidden subgraph characterizations for $(2,2)$-polar graphs on $P_4$-sparse and $P_4$-extendible graphs, also generalizing analogous results recently obtained for the class of cographs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $t \geq 2$, the $t$-core of a partition plays an important role in modular representation theory and combinatorics. We initiate the study of $t$-cores of partitions contained in an $r \times s$ rectangle. Our main results are as follows. We first give a simple formula for the number of partitions in the rectangle that are themselves $t$-cores and compute its asymptotics for large $r,s$. We then prove that the number of partitions inside the rectangle whose $t$-cores are a fixed partition $\rho$ is given by a product of binomial coefficients. Finally, we use this formula to compute the distribution of the $t$-core of a uniformly random partition inside the rectangle extending our previous work on all partitions of a fixed integer $n$ (Ann. Appl. Prob. 2023). In particular, we show that in the limit as $r,s \to \infty$ maintaining a fixed aspect ratio, we again obtain a Gamma distribution with the same shape parameter $\alpha = (t-1)/2$ and rate parameter $\beta$ that depends on the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>A construction of a $\frac{3}{2}$-tough plane triangulation with no 2-factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1956, Tutte proved the celebrated theorem that every 4-connected planar graph is hamiltonian. This result implies that every more than $\frac{3}{2}$-tough planar graph on at least three vertices is hamiltonian and so has a 2-factor. Owens in 1999 constructed non-hamiltonian maximal planar graphs of toughness arbitrarily close to $\frac{3}{2}$ and asked whether there exists a maximal non-hamiltonian planar graph of toughness exactly $\frac{3}{2}$. In fact, the graphs Owens constructed do not even contain a 2-factor. Thus the toughness of exactly $\frac{3}{2}$ is the only case left in asking the existence of 2-factors in tough planar graphs. This question was also asked by Bauer, Broersma, and Schmeichel in a survey. In this paper, we close this gap by constructing a maximal $\frac{3}{2}$-tough plane graph with no 2-factor, answering the question asked by Owens as well as by Bauer, Broersma, and Schmeichel.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the substructures of a hypergraph that lead us to linearly dependent rows (or columns) in the incidence matrix of the hypergraph.
  These substructures are closely related to the spectra of various hypergraph matrices, including the signless Laplacian, adjacency, Laplacian, and adjacency matrices of the hypergraph's incidence graph. Specific eigenvectors of these hypergraph matrices serve to characterize these substructures. We show that vectors belonging to the nullspace of the adjacency matrix of the hypergraph's incidence graph provide a distinctive description of these substructures. Additionally, we illustrate that these substructures exhibit inherent similarities and redundancies, which manifest in analogous behaviours during random walks and similar values of hypergraph centralities.</description>

Abstract: The Sylvester-Gallai Theorem states that every rank-$3$ real-representable matroid has a two-point line. We prove that, for each $k\ge 2$, every complex-representable matroid with rank at least $4^{k-1}$ has a rank-$k$ flat with exactly $k$ points. For $k=2$, this is a well-known result due to Kelly, which we use in our proof. A similar result was proved earlier by Barak, Dvir, Wigderson, and Yehudayoff and later refined by Dvir, Saraf, and Wigderson, but we get slightly better bounds with a more elementary proof.</description>

Abstract: We study flips in hypertriangulations of planar points sets. Here a level-$k$ hypertriangulation of $n$ points in the planes is a subdivision induced by the projection of a $k$-hypersimplex, which is the convex hull of the barycenters of the $(k-1)$-dimensional faces of the standard $(n-1)$-simplex. In particular, we introduce four types of flips and prove that the level-2 hypertriangulations are connected by these flips.</description>

      <title>$t$-sails and sparse hereditary classes of unbounded tree-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04783v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that the following basic objects are obstructions to bounded tree-width: for arbitrarily large $t$, $(1)$ the complete graph $K_t$, $(2)$ the complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$, $(3)$ a subdivision of the $(t \times t)$-wall and $(4)$ the line graph of a subdivision of the $(t \times t)$-wall. We now add a further \emph{boundary object} to this list, a \emph{$t$-sail}.
  These results have been obtained by studying sparse hereditary \emph{path-star} graph classes, each of which consists of the finite induced subgraphs of a single infinite graph whose edges can be partitioned into a path (or forest of paths) with a forest of stars, characterised by an infinite word over a possibly infinite alphabet. We show that a path-star class whose infinite graph has an unbounded number of stars, each of which connects an unbounded number of times to the path, has unbounded tree-width. In addition, we show that such a class is not a subclass of the hereditary class of circle graphs.
  We identify a collection of \emph{nested} words with a recursive structure that exhibit interesting characteristics when used to define a path-star graph class. These graph classes do not contain any of the four basic obstructions but instead contain graphs that have large tree-width if and only if they contain arbitrarily large $t$-sails. We show that these classes are infinitely defined and, like classes of bounded degree or classes excluding a fixed minor, do not contain a minimal class of unbounded tree-width.</description>

      <title>Twists of Gr(3,n) Cluster Variables as Double and Triple Dimer Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial interpretation for certain cluster variables in Grassmannian cluster algebras in terms of double and triple dimer configurations. More specifically, we examine several Gr(3,n) cluster variables that may be written as degree two or degree three polynomials in terms of Pl\"ucker coordinates, and give generating functions for their images under the twist map - a cluster algebra automorphism introduced in work of Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky. The generating functions range over certain double or triple dimer configurations on an associated plabic graph, which we describe using particular non-crossing matchings or webs (as defined by Kuperberg), respectively. These connections shed light on a recent conjecture of Cheung et al., extend the concept of web duality introduced in a paper of Fraser-Lam-Le, and more broadly make headway on understanding Grassmannian cluster algebras for Gr(3,n).</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of arcs in $4$-dicritical oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ of a digraph $D$ is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the vertices of a digraph such that each colour class induces an acyclic subdigraph. A digraph $D$ is $k$-dicritical if $\vec{\chi}(D) = k$ and each proper subdigraph $H$ of $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(H) &lt; k$.
  For integers $k$ and $n$, we define $d_k(n)$ (respectively $o_k(n)$) as the minimum number of arcs possible in a $k$-dicritical digraph (respectively oriented graph). Kostochka and Stiebitz have shown that $d_4(n) \geq \frac{10}{3}n -\frac{4}{3}$. They also conjectured that there is a constant $c$ such that $o_k(n) \geq cd_k(n)$ for $k\geq 3$ and $n$ large enough. This conjecture is known to be true for $k=3$ (Aboulker et al.).
  In this work, we prove that every $4$-dicritical oriented graph on $n$ vertices has at least $(\frac{10}{3}+\frac{1}{51})n-1$ arcs, showing the conjecture for $k=4$. We also characterise exactly the $k$-dicritical digraphs on $n$ vertices with exactly $\frac{10}{3}n -\frac{4}{3}$ arcs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The investigation of width parameters in both graph and algebraic contexts has attracted considerable interest. Among these parameters, the linear branch width has emerged as a crucial measure. In this concise paper, we explore the concept of linear decomposition, specifically focusing on the single filter in a connectivity system. Additionally, we examine the relevance of matroids, antimatroids, and greedoids in the context of connectivity systems. Our primary objective in this study is to shed light on the impediments to linear decomposition from multiple perspectives.</description>

      <title>Minimum number of arcs in $k$-critical digraphs with order at most $2k-1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ of a digraph $D$ is the least integer $k$ for which $D$ has a coloring with $k$ colors such that there is no monochromatic directed cycle in $D$. The digraphs considered here are finite and may have antiparallel arcs, but no parallel arcs. A digraph $D$ is called $k$-critical if each proper subdigraph $D'$ of $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D')&lt;\vec{\chi}(D)=k$. For integers $k$ and $n$, let $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{ext}}(k,n)$ denote the minimum number of arcs possible in a $k$-critical digraph of order $n$. It is easy to show that $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{ext}}(2,n)=n$ for all $n\geq 2$, and $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{ext}}(3,n)\geq 2n$ for all possible $n$, where equality holds if and only if $n$ is odd and $n\geq 3$. As a main result we prove that if $n, k$ and $p$ are integers with $n=k+p$ and $2\leq p \leq k-1$, then $\overrightarrow{\mathrm{ext}}(k,n)=2({\binom{n}{2}} - (p^2+1))$, and we give an exact characterisation of $k$-critical digraphs for which equality holds. This generalizes a result about critical graphs obtained in 1963 by Tibor Gallai.</description>

      <title>A decomposition theorem for balanced measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a connected graph. A probability measure $\mu$ on $V$ is called "balanced" if it has the following property: if $T_\mu(v)$ denotes the "earth mover's" cost of transporting all the mass of $\mu$ from all over the graph to the vertex $v$, then $T_\mu$ attains its global maximum at each point in the support of $\mu$. We prove a decomposition result that characterizes balanced measures as convex combinations of suitable "extremal" balanced measures that we call "basic." An upper bound on the number of basic balanced measures on $G$ follows, and an example shows that this estimate is essentially sharp.</description>

      <title>The growth rate of multicolor Ramsey numbers of $3$-graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-color Ramsey number of a $k$-uniform hypergraph $G,$ denoted $r(G;q)$, is the minimum integer $N$ such that any coloring of the edges of the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $N$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $G$. The study of these numbers is one of the most central topics in combinatorics. One natural question, which for triangles goes back to the work of Schur in 1916, is to determine the behaviour of $r(G;q)$ for fixed $G$ and $q$ tending to infinity. In this paper we study this problem for $3$-uniform hypergraphs and determine the tower height of $r(G;q)$ as a function of $q$. More precisely, given a hypergraph $G$, we determine when $r(G; q)$ behaves polynomially, exponentially or double-exponentially in $q$. This answers a question of Axenovich, Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, Liu and Mubayi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{a} = (a_{i})_{i \geq 1}$ be a sequence in a field $\mathbb{F}$, and $f \colon \mathbb{F} \times \mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{F}$ be a function such that $f(a_{i},a_{i}) \neq 0$ for all $i \geq 1$. For any tournament $T$ over $[n]$, consider the $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $M_{T}$ with zero diagonal whose $(i,j)$th entry (for $i &lt; j$) is $f(a_{i},a_{j})$ if $i \to j$ in $T$, and $f(a_{j},a_{i})$ if $j \to i$ in $T$. It is known (cf. Balachandran et al., Linear Algebra Appl. 658 (2023), 310-318) that if $T$ is a uniformly random tournament over $[n]$, then $\operatorname{rank}(M_{T}) \geq (\frac{1}{2}-o(1))n$ with high probability when $\operatorname{char}(\mathbb{F}) \neq 2$ and $f$ is a linear function.
  In this paper, we investigate the other extremal question: how low can the ranks of such matrices be? We work with sequences $\mathbf{a}$ that take only two distinct values, so the rank of any such $n \times n$ matrix is at least $n/2$. First, we show that the rank of any such matrix depends on whether an associated bipartite graph has certain eigenvalues of high multiplicity. Using this, we show that if $f$ is linear, then there are real matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $\frac{n}{2} + O(1)$. For rational matrices, we show that for each $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we can find a sequence $\mathbf{a}(\varepsilon)$ for which there are matrices $M_{T}(f;\mathbf{a})$ of rank at most $(\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon)n + O(1)$. These matrices are constructed from symmetric designs, and we also use them to produce bisection-closed families of size greater than $\lfloor 3n/2 \rfloor - 2$ for $n \leq 15$, which improves the previously best known bound (cf. Balachandran et al., Electron J. Combin. 26 (2019), #P2.40).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the graph homomorphism problem, denoted by $Hom(H)$, we are given a graph $G$ and we have to determine whether there exists an edge-preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G) \to V(H)$. Note that $Hom(C_3)$, where $C_3$ is the cycle of length $3$, is equivalent to $3$-Coloring. The question whether $3$-Coloring is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs is a well-known open problem. In this paper we study the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem on bounded-diameter graphs for $k\geq 2$, so we consider all other odd cycles than $C_3$. We prove that for $k\geq 2$, the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$(k+1)$ graphs -- note that such a result for $k=1$ would be precisely a polynomial-time algorithm for $3$-Coloring of diameter-$2$ graphs.
  Furthermore, we give subexponential-time algorithms for diameter-$(k+2)$ and -$(k+3)$ graphs.
  We complement these results with a lower bound for diameter-$(2k+2)$ graphs -- in this class of graphs the $Hom(C_{2k+1})$ problem is NP-hard and cannot be solved in subexponential-time, unless the ETH fails.
  Finally, we consider another direction of generalizing $3$-Coloring on diameter-$2$ graphs. We consider other target graphs $H$ than odd cycles but we restrict ourselves to diameter $2$. We show that if $H$ is triangle-free, then $Hom(H)$ is polynomial-time solvable on diameter-$2$ graphs.</description>

Abstract: For a given graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its $n$-th subdivision as the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every edge by a path of length $n$. We also define the $m$-th power of $G$ as the graph on vertex set $V$ where we connect every pair of vertices at distance at most $m$ in $G$. In this paper we study the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs and we obtain an exact bound for $n=3$ and $m=2$. Additionally, we resolve the case $m=n$ asymptotically; in particular, our result confirms a conjecture of Mozafari-Nia and Iradmusa in the case $m=n=3$ in a strong sense.</description>

Abstract: We prove a connection formula between two multivariate generalizations of the Eulerian polynomials $A^{\cyc}_n(x,y, t\,|\,\alpha)$ and $A_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4, f, g, t\,|\,\alpha, \beta)$, which enumerate permutations related to excedance and descent based statistics respectively. By exploring this connection, we derive the exponential generating function of the latter polynomials and several
  $\gamma$-positivity formulas for variants of Eulerian polynomials. In particular, our results generalise the main results in two recent papers by Ji \cite{Ji23} and Ji-Lin \cite{JL23}. Our proofs are combinatorial in nature and involve Foata's fundamental transformation and a cyclic analogue of valley-hopping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $S$ a sequence with elements of $G$. Let $|S|$ denote the length of $S$ and $\mathrm{supp}(S)$ the set of all the distinct terms in $S$. For an integer $k$ with $k\in [1, |S|]$, let $\Sigma_{k}(S) \subset G$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a subsequence of $S$ with length $k$. Let $\Sigma(S)=\cup_{k=1}^{|S|}\Sigma_{k}(S)$ and $\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)=\cup_{t=k}^{|S|}\Sigma_{t}(S)$. It is known that if $0\not\in \Sigma(S)$, then $|\Sigma(S)|\geq |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$. In this paper, we determine the structure of a sequence $S$ satisfying $0\notin \Sigma(S)$ and $|\Sigma(S)|= |S|+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|-1$. As a consequence, we can give a counterexample of a conjecture of Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia. Moreover, we prove that if $|S|&gt;k$ and $0\not\in \Sigma_{\geq k}(S)\cup \mathrm{supp}(S)$, then $|\Sigma_{\geq k}(S)|\geq |S|-k+|\mathrm{supp}(S)|$. Then we can give an alternative proof of a conjecture of Hamidoune, which was first proved by Gao, Grynkiewicz, and Xia.</description>

Abstract: The Abelian sandpile model was the first example of a self-organized critical system studied by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld. The dynamics of the sandpiles occur when the grains topple over a graph. In this study, we allow the graph to evolve over time and change the topology at each stage. This turns out in the occurrence of phenomena impossible in the classical sandpile models. For instance, configurations over evolutive graphs that are always unstable. We also experiment with the stabilization of configurations with a large number of grains at the center over evolutive graphs, this allows us to obtain interesting fractals. Finally, we obtain some power laws associated with some evolutive graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a common generalization to several mass partition results using hyperplane arrangements to split $\mathbb{R}^d$ into two sets. Our main result implies the ham-sandwich theorem, the necklace splitting theorem for two thieves, a theorem about chessboard splittings with hyperplanes with fixed directions, and all known cases of Langerman's conjecture about equipartitions with $n$ hyperplanes.
  Our main result also confirms an infinite number of previously unknown cases of the following conjecture of Takahashi and Sober\'on:
  For any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist an arrangement of $k$ parallel hyperplanes that bisects each of the measures.
  The general result follows from the case of measures that are supported on a finite set with an odd number of points. The proof for this case is inspired by ideas of differential and algebraic topology, but it is a completely elementary parity argument.</description>

Abstract: In infinite graph theory, the notion of ends, first introduced by Freudenthal and Jung for locally finite graphs, plays an important role when generalizing statements from finite graphs to infinite ones. Nash-Willian's Tree-Packing Theorem and MacLane's Planarity Criteria are examples of results that allow a topological approach, in which ends might be considered as endpoints of rays. In fact, there are extensive works in the literature showing that classical theorems of (vertex-)connectivity for finite graphs can be discussed regarding ends, in a more general context. However, aiming to generalize results of edge-connectivity, this paper recalls the definition of edge-ends in infinite graphs due to Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}. In terms of that object, we state an edge version of Menger's Theorem (following a previous work of Polat) and generalize the Lov\'asz-Cherkassky Theorem for infinite graphs with edge-ends (inspired by a paper of Jacobs, Jo\'o, Knappe, Kurkofka and Melcher).</description>

      <title>Transitive closure in a polluted environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new percolation model, inspired by recent works on jigsaw percolation, graph bootstrap percolation, and percolation in polluted environments. Start with an oriented graph $G_0$ of initially occupied edges on $n$ vertices, and iteratively occupy additional (oriented) edges by transitivity, with the constraint that only open edges in a certain random set can ever be occupied. All other edges are closed, creating a set of obstacles for the spread of occupied edges. When $G_0$ is an unoriented linear graph, and leftward and rightward edges are open independently with possibly different probabilities, we identify three regimes in which the set of eventually occupied edges is either all open edges, the majority of open edges in one direction, or only a very small proportion of all open edges. In the more general setting where $G_0$ is a connected unoriented graph of bounded degree, we show that the transition between sparse and full occupation of open edges occurs when the probability of open edges is $(\log n)^{-1/2+o(1)}$. We conclude with several conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>Differential transcendence of Bell numbers and relatives: a Galois theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15292v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003 Klazar proved that the ordinary generating function of the sequence of Bell numbers is differentially transcendental over the field $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$ of meromorphic functions at $0$. We show that Klazar's result is an instance of a general phenomenon that can be proven in a compact way using difference Galois theory. We present the main principles of this theory in order to prove a general result about differential transcendence over $\mathbb{C}(\{t\})$, that we apply to many other (infinite classes of) examples of generating functions, including as very special cases the ones considered by Klazar. Most of our examples belong to Sheffer's class, well studied notably in umbral calculus. They all bring concrete evidence in support to the Pak-Yeliussizov conjecture, according to which a sequence whose both ordinary and exponential generating functions satisfy nonlinear differential equations with polynomial coefficients necessarily satisfies a linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>The music box operad: Random generation of musical phrases from patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multi-patterns, a combinatorial abstraction of polyphonic musical phrases. The interest of this approach in encoding musical phrases lies in the fact that it becomes possible to compose multi-patterns in order to produce new ones. This composition is parameterized by a monoid structure on the scale degrees. This embeds the set of the musical phrases into an algebraic framework since the set of the multi-patterns is endowed with the structure of an operad. Operads are algebraic structures offering a formalization and an abstraction of the notion of operators and their compositions. Seeing musical phrases as operators allows us to perform computations on phrases and admits applications in generative music. Indeed, given a set of initial multi-patterns, we propose various algorithms to randomly generate a new and longer phrase emulating the style suggested by the inputted multi-patterns. The designed algorithms use types of grammars working with operads and colored operads, known as bud generating systems.</description>

      <title>On the geography of $3$-folds via asymptotic behavior of invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roughly speaking, the problem of geography asks for the existence of varieties of general type after we fix some invariants. In dimension $1$, where we fix the genus, the geography question is trivial, but already in dimension $2$, it becomes a hard problem in general. In higher dimensions, this problem is essentially wide open. In this paper, we focus on geography in dimension $3$. We generalize the techniques which compare the geography of surfaces with the geography of arrangements of curves via asymptotic constructions. In dimension $2$ this involves resolutions of cyclic quotient singularities and a certain asymptotic behavior of the associated Dedekind sums and continued fractions. We discuss the general situation with emphasis on dimension $3$, analyzing the singularities and various resolutions that show up, and proving results about the asymptotic behavior of the invariants we fix.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>

Abstract: We revisit and generalize inequalities for the summatory function of the sum of digits in a given integer base. We prove that several known results can be deduced from a theorem in a 2023 paper by Mohanty, Greenbury, Sarkany, Narayanan, Dingle, Ahnert, and Louis, whose primary scope is the maximum mutational robustness in genotype-phenotype maps.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the closed neighborhood ideal of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph and let $NI(G)$ denote the closed neighborhood ideal of $G$ in a polynomial ring $R$. We show that if $G$ is a forest, then the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ is the same as the matching number of $G$, thus proving a conjecture of Sharifan and Moradi in the affirmative. We also show that if $G$ contains a simplicial vertex, then $NI(G)$ admits a Betti splitting, and consequently, the matching number of $G$ provides a lower bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $R/NI(G)$ when $G$ is a chordal graph, unicyclic graph, complete bipartite graph, or the wheel graph. For forests and unicyclic graphs, we show that the projective dimension of $R/NI(G)$ is also bounded below by the matching number of $G$. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the regularity and the matching number for two graph operations, namely, the join and the corona product of two graphs.</description>

      <title>The algebraic matroid of the Heron variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the n-th Heron variety as the realization space of the (squared) volumes of faces of an n-simplex. Our primary goal is to understand the extent to which Heron's formula, which expresses the area of a triangle as a function of its three edge lengths, can be generalized. Such a formula for one face volume of an n-simplex in terms of other face volumes expresses a dependence in the algebraic matroid of the Heron variety. Whether the volume is expressible in terms of radicals is controlled by the monodromy groups of the coordinate projections of the Heron variety onto coordinates of bases. We discuss a suite of algorithms, some new, for determining these matroids and monodromy groups. We apply these algorithms toward the smaller Heron varieties, organize our findings, and interpret the results in the context of our original motivation.</description>

      <title>The slope of v-function and Waldschmidt constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the v-number of a Noetherian graded filtration $\mathcal{I}= \{I_{[k]}\}_{k\geq 0}$ of a Noetherian $\mathbb{N}$-graded domain $R$. Recently, it is shown that $\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})$ is periodically linear in $k$ for $k \gg 0$. We show that all these linear functions have the same slope, i.e. $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})}{k}$ exists, which is equal to $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\alpha(I_{[k]})}{k}$, where $\alpha(I)$ denotes the minimum degree of a non-zero element in $I$. In particular, for any Noetherian symbolic filtration $\mathcal{I}= \{I^{(k)}\}_{k\geq 0}$ of $R$, it follows that $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})}{k}=\hat{\alpha}(I)$, the Waldschmidt constant of $I$. Next, for a non-equigenerated square-free monomial ideal $I$, we prove that $\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)}) \leq \mathrm{reg}(R/I^{(k)})$ for $k\gg 0$. Also, for an ideal $I$ having the symbolic strong persistence property, we give a linear upper bound on $\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})$. As an application, we derive some criteria for a square-free monomial ideal $I$ to satisfy $\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})\leq \mathrm{reg}(R/I^{(k)})$ for all $k\geq 1$, and provide several examples in support. In addition, for any simple graph $G$, we establish that $\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) \leq \mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})$ for all $k \geq 1$, and $\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) = \mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})=\alpha(J(G)^{(k)})-1$ for all $k\geq 1$ if and only if $G$ is a Cohen-Macaulay very-well covered graph, where $J(G)$ is the cover ideal of $G$.</description>

      <title>Computing the $D$-base and $D$-relation in finite closure systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the $D$-base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the $D$-relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The $D$-base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the $D$-relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the $D$-base and the $D$-relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the $D$-base and $D$-relation. Specifically, we establish the $NP$-completeness of finding the $D$-relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the $D$-base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the $D$-base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the $D$-base and $D$-relation of a closure system.</description>
