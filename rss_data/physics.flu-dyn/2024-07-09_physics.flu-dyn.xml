      <title>Dynamics of quantum turbulence in axially rotating thermal counterflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation, statistically steady state, and temporal decay of axially rotating thermal counterflow of superfluid $^4$He (He~II) in a square channel is probed using the second sound attenuation technique, measuring the density of quantized vortex lines. The array of rectilinear quantized vortices created by rotation strongly affects the development of quantum turbulence. At relatively slow angular velocities, the type of instability responsible for the destruction of the laminar counterflow qualitatively changes: the growth of seed vortex loops pinned on the channel wall becomes gradually replaced by the growth due to Donnelly-Glaberson instability, which leads to rapid growth of helical Kelvin waves on vortices parallel with applied counterflow. The initial transient growth of vortex line density that follows the sudden start of the counterflow appears self-similar, linear in dimensionless time, $\Omega t$. We show numerically that Kelvin waves of sufficiently strong amplitude reorient the vortices into more flattened shapes, which grow similarly to a free vortex ring. The observed steady state vortex line density at sufficiently high counterflow velocity and its early temporal decay after the counterflow is switched off is not appreciably affected by rotation. It is striking, however, that although the steady state of rotating counterflow is very different from rotating classical grid-generated turbulence, the late temporal decay of both displays similar features: the decay exponent decreases with the rotation rate $\Omega$ from -3/2 towards approximately -0.7, typical for two-dimensional turbulence, consistent with the transition to bidirectional cascade.</description>

      <title>An aeroacoustic mechanism to explain universal behavior in hypersonic wake flow oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies reveal that the near-wake region of a circular cylinder at hypersonic Mach numbers exhibits self-sustained flow oscillations. The oscillation frequency was found to have a universal behavior. Experimental observations suggest an aeroacoustic feedback loop to be the driving mechanism of oscillations. An analytical aeroacoustic model which predicts the experimentally observed frequencies and explains the universal behavior is presented here. The model provides physical insights and informs of flow regimes where deviations from universal behavior are to be expected.</description>

      <title>On the fractal dimension of non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flow subject to Saffman-Taylor instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete numerical method based on the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) approach to simulate two-fluid Hele-Shaw flow subject to the Saffman-Taylor interfacial instability, in the case where the displaced fluid is non-Newtonian. Focusing on fluids for which the most relevant non-Newtonian aspect of the thin-gap flow is shear-thinning, we introduce a history-dependent aspect into the algorithm, modeling shear-rate-dependent fluid viscosity. The main finding is that the morphology of the emerging patterns, characterized by the fractal dimension, is modified in a nontrivial manner by the shear-thinning nature of the displaced fluid. In particular, we consistently find that shear-thinning leads to the formation of patterns characterized by a smaller fractal dimension, compared to the corresponding Newtonian fluid.</description>

      <title>Resolvent analysis of a swimming foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs resolvent analysis to explore the dynamics and coherent structures in the boundary layer of a foil that swims via a travelling wave undulation. A modified NACA foil shape is used together with undulatory kinematics to represent fish-like bodies at realistic Reynolds numbers ($ \mathit{Re} = 10,000 $ and $ \mathit{Re} = 100,000 $) in both thrust- and drag-producing propulsion regimes. We introduce a novel coordinate transformation that enables the implementation of the data-driven resolvent analysis \citep{herrmann_data-driven_2021} to dissect the stability of the boundary layer of the swimming foil. This is the first study to implement resolvent analysis on deforming bodies with non-zero thickness and at realistic swimming Reynolds numbers. The analysis reinforces the notion that swimming kinematics drive the system's physics. In drag-producing regimes, it reveals breakdown mechanisms of the propulsive wave, while thrust-producing regimes show a uniform wave amplification across the foil's back half. The key thrust and drag mechanisms scale with the boundary-layer thickness, implying geometric self-similarity in this $\mathit{Re}$ regime. In addition, we identify a mechanism that is less strongly coupled to the body motion. We offer a comparison to a rough foil that reduces the amplification of this mechanism, demonstrating the potential of roughness to control the amplification of key mechanisms in the flow. The results provide valuable insights into the dynamics of swimming bodies and highlight avenues for developing opposition control strategies.</description>

      <title>A survey on isothermal and isentropic Baer-Nunziato-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component Baer-Nunziato-type models for isothermal and isentropic fluids are investigated. These are given by balance equations for volume fractions, density and momentum for each component accounting for the relaxation to equilibrium by means of relaxation terms. Mathematical properties of the models are derived such as hyperbolicity and symmetrization. The fields are characterized and corresponding Riemann invariants are determined. Appropriate entropy-entropy flux pairs are derived taking into account the phasic energy equations including the heat flux. Physically meaningful constraints are presented that ensure the entropy inequality to hold. Instantaneous relaxation to equilibrium is investigated and appropriate algorithms are presented. Numerical results for the isothermal Baer-Nunziato model are compared to an isothermal Euler model and to an isothermal phase-field model.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Multidimensional Slope Limiters with Local Maximum Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order numerical methods are used to find accurate numerical solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations and equations of transport type. Limiting is required to either converge to the correct type of solution or to adhere to physically motivated local maximum principles. Less restrictive limiting procedures are required so as to not severely decrease the accuracy.
  In this paper, we develop an existing slope limiter framework, to achieve different local boundedness principles for higher-order schemes on unstructured meshes. Quadrature points contributing to numerical fluxes can be limited based on face defined maximum principles, and the resulting cell mean at the next timestep can satisfy a cell mean maximum principle but with less limiting. We demonstrate the practical application of the introduced framework to a second-order finite volume scheme as well as a fourth-order finite volume scheme, in the context of the advection equation.</description>

      <title>Vorticity blowup in 2D compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove finite-time vorticity blowup for smooth solutions of the 2D compressible Euler equations with smooth, localized, and non-vacuous initial data. The vorticity blowup occurs at the time of the first singularity, and is accompanied by an axisymmetric implosion in which the swirl velocity enjoys full stability, as opposed to finite co-dimension stability.</description>

      <title>Stabilisation of falling liquid films with restricted observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to stabilise a solution to equations describing the interface of thin liquid films falling under gravity with a finite number of actuators and restricted observations. As for many complex systems, full observation of the system state is challenging in physical settings, so methods able to take this into account are important. The Navier-Stokes equations modelling the flow are a complex, highly nonlinear set of PDEs, so standard control theoretical results are not applicable. Instead, we chain together a hierarchy of increasingly idealised approximations, developing a control strategy for the simplified model which is shown to be successfully applied to simulations of the full system.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations for heat and momentum transport in sheared Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide scaling relations for the Nusselt number $Nu$ and the friction coefficient $C_{S}$ in sheared Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, i.e., in Rayleigh-B\'enard flow with Couette or Poiseuille type shear forcing, by extending the Grossmann &amp; Lohse (2000,2001,2002,2004) theory to sheared thermal convection. The control parameters for these systems are the Rayleigh number $Ra$, the Prandtl number $Pr$, and the Reynolds number $Re_S$ that characterises the strength of the imposed shear. By direct numerical simulations and theoretical considerations, we show that in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, the friction coefficients associated with the applied shear and the shear generated by the large-scale convection rolls are both well described by Prandtl's (1932) logarithmic friction law, suggesting some kind of universality between purely shear driven flows and thermal convection. These scaling relations hold well for $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, $0.5 \leq Pr \leq 5.0$, and $0 \leq Re_S \leq 10^4$.</description>

      <title>Nested traveling wave structures in elastoinertial turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic flow resulting from the interplay between inertia and viscoelasticity in wall bounded shear flows. Understanding EIT is important because it is thought to set a limit on the effectiveness of turbulent drag reduction in polymer solutions. Here, we analyze simulations of two dimensional EIT in channel flow using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), discovering a family of traveling wave structures that capture the sheetlike stress fluctuations that characterize EIT. The frequency dependence of the leading SPOD mode contains distinct peaks and the mode structures corresponding to these peaks exhibit well defined traveling structures. The structure of the dominant traveling mode exhibits shift reflect symmetry similar to the viscoelasticity modified Tollmien Schlichting (TS) wave, where the velocity fluctuation in the traveling mode is characterized by large scale regular structures spanning the channel and the polymer stress field is characterized by thin, inclined sheets of high polymer stress localized at the critical layers near the channel walls. The traveling structures corresponding to the higher frequency modes have a very similar structure, but are nested in a region roughly bounded by the critical layer positions of the next lower frequency mode. A simple theory based on the idea that the critical layers of mode $\kappa$ form the "walls" for the structure of mode $\kappa+1$ yields quantitative agreement with the observed wave speeds and critical layer positions, indicating self similarity between the structures. The physical idea behind this theory is that the sheetlike localized stress fluctuations in the critical layer prevent velocity fluctuations from penetrating them.</description>

      <title>SNF-ROM: Projection-based nonlinear reduced order modeling with smooth neural fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. Numerical experiments reveal that SNF-ROM is able to accelerate the full-order computation by up to $199\times$. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.</description>
