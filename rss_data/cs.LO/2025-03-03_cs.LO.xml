      <title>Domains, Information Frames, Rough Sets: An Equivalence of Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of Scott's information systems~\cite{sco82} is presented that captures exactly all continuous domains. The global consistency predicate in Scott's definition is relativized. Now, for every atomic statement, there is a consistency predicate that states which finite sets of statements express information that is consistent with the given statement. The category of information frames is shown to be equivalent to the category of domains. Moreover, the relationship with CF-approximation spaces introduced by Wu and Xu~\cite{wx23} is studied. The corresponding category is also shown to be equivalent with the category of information frames. This research achieves a refinement of the equivalence result of Wu and Xu of the category of CF-approximation spaces with the category of domains.</description>

      <title>Proof systems for partial incorrectness logic (partial reverse Hoare logic)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial incorrectness logic (partial reverse Hoare logic) has recently been introduced as a new Hoare-style logic that over-approximates the weakest pre-conditions of a program and a post-condition. It is expected to verify systems where the final state must guarantee its initial state, such as authentication, secure communication tools and digital signatures. However, the logic has only been given semantics. This paper defines two proof systems for partial incorrectness logic (partial reverse Hoare logic): ordinary and cyclic proof systems. They are sound and relatively complete. The relative completeness of our ordinary proof system is proved by showing that the weakest pre-condition of a while loop and a post-condition is its loop invariant. The relative completeness of our cyclic proof system is also proved by providing a way to transform any cyclic proof into an ordinary proof.</description>

      <title>Bounded First-Class Universe Levels in Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dependent type theory, being able to refer to a type universe as a term itself increases its expressive power, but requires mechanisms in place to prevent Girard's paradox from introducing logical inconsistency in the presence of type-in-type. The simplest mechanism is a hierarchy of universes indexed by a sequence of levels, typically the naturals. To improve reusability of definitions, they can be made level polymorphic, abstracting over level variables and adding a notion of level expressions. For even more expressive power, level expressions can be made first-class as terms themselves, and level polymorphism is subsumed by dependent functions quantifying over levels. Furthermore, bounded level polymorphism provides more expressivity by being able to explicitly state constraints on level variables. While semantics for first-class levels with constraints are known, syntax and typing rules have not been explicitly written down. Yet pinning down a well-behaved syntax is not trivial; there exist prior type theories with bounded level polymorphism that fail to satisfy subject reduction. In this work, we design an explicit syntax for a type theory with bounded first-class levels, parametrized over arbitrary well-founded sets of levels. We prove the metatheoretic properties of subject reduction, type safety, consistency, and canonicity, entirely mechanized from syntax to semantics in Lean.</description>

      <title>Terminating Hybrid Tableaus for Ordered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid logic extends modal logic with special propositions called nominals, each of which is true at only one state in a model. This enables us to describe some properties of binary relations, such as irreflexivity and anti-symmetry, which are essential to treat partial orders. We present terminating tableau calculi complete with respect to models whose accessibility relations are strictly partially ordered, unbounded strictly partially ordered, and partially ordered.</description>

      <title>Cryptis: Cryptographic Reasoning in Separation Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Cryptis, an extension of the Iris separation logic that can be used to verify cryptographic components using the symbolic model of cryptography. The combination of separation logic and cryptographic reasoning allows us to prove the correctness of a protocol and later reuse this result to verify larger systems that rely on the protocol. To make this integration possible, we propose novel specifications for authentication protocols that allow agents in a network to agree on the use of system resources. We evaluate our approach by verifying various authentication protocols and a key-value store server that uses these authentication protocols to connect to clients. Our results are formalized in Coq.</description>

      <title>Formalizing MLTL Formula Progression in Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic (MLTL) is rapidly increasing in popularity as a specification logic, e.g., for runtime verification and model checking, driving a need for a trustworthy tool base for analyzing MLTL. In this work, we formalize the syntax and semantics of MLTL and a library of key properties, including useful custom induction rules. We envision this library as being useful for future formalizations involving MLTL and as serving as a reference point for theoretical work using or developing MLTL. We then formalize the algorithm and correctness theorems for MLTL formula progression; along the way, we identify and fix several errors and gaps in the source material. A main motivation for our work is tool validation; we ensure the executability of our algorithms by using Isabelle's built-in code generator.</description>

      <title>Branch Sequentialization in Quantum Polytime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation leverages the use of quantumly-controlled conditionals in order to achieve computational advantage. However, since the different branches in the conditional may operate on the same qubits, a typical approach to compilation involves performing the branches sequentially, which can easily lead to an exponential blowup of the program complexity. We introduce and study a compilation technique for avoiding branch sequentialization in a language that is sound and complete for quantum polynomial time, improving on previously existing polynomial size bounds and showing the existence of techniques that preserve the intuitive complexity of the program.</description>

      <title>FORM: Learning Expressive and Transferable First-Order Logic Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are an effective approach for addressing non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) through finite-state machines. Traditional RMs, which label edges with propositional logic formulae, inherit the limited expressivity of propositional logic. This limitation hinders the learnability and transferability of RMs since complex tasks will require numerous states and edges. To overcome these challenges, we propose First-Order Reward Machines ($\texttt{FORM}$s), which use first-order logic to label edges, resulting in more compact and transferable RMs. We introduce a novel method for $\textbf{learning}$ $\texttt{FORM}$s and a multi-agent formulation for $\textbf{exploiting}$ them and facilitate their transferability, where multiple agents collaboratively learn policies for a shared $\texttt{FORM}$. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{FORM}$s with respect to traditional RMs. Specifically, we show that $\texttt{FORM}$s can be effectively learnt for tasks where traditional RM learning approaches fail. We also show significant improvements in learning speed and task transferability thanks to the multi-agent learning framework and the abstraction provided by the first-order language.</description>
