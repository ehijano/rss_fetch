      <title>Searching for Triple Systems Unbound by Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large fraction of massive stars are found in higher order systems where the presence of a tertiary may significantly modify the system's evolution. In particular, it can lead to increased numbers of compact object binaries and accelerate their mergers with important implications for gravitational wave observations. Using Gaia, we constrain the number of Galactic supernovae that produce unbound triples. We do this by searching 8 supernova remnants for stars with consistent Gaia parallaxes and paths intersecting near the center of the supernova remnant at a time consistent with the age of the remnant. We find no candidates for unbound triple systems. Combined with prior work, less than 11.4\% of supernovae leave behind unbound triples at a 90\% confidence limit. The absence of such systems limits their role in the evolution of massive stars and the formation of merging compact objects.</description>

      <title>Deriving X-ray Line Profiles for Massive-Star Winds from Momentum-Conserving Dynamical Working Surface Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general procedure for deriving a line profile model for massive star X-ray spectra that captures the dynamics of the wind more directly. The basis of the model is the analytic solution to the problem of variable jets in Herbig-Haro objects given by \citet{Canto2000}. In deriving our model, we generalize this jet solution to include flows with a prescribed nonzero acceleration for the context of radiatively driven winds. We provide example line profiles generated from our model for the case of sinusoidal velocity and mass ejection variations. The example profiles show the expected shape of massive star X-ray emission lines, as well as interesting but complicated trends with the model parameters. This establishes the possibility that observed X-rays could be a result of temporal variations seeded at the wind base, rather than purely generated intrinsically within the wind volume, and can be described via a quantitative language that connects with the physical attributes of those variations, consistently with the downstream momentum-conserving nature of radiatively cooled shocked radial flows.</description>

      <title>Impact of far-side structures observed by Solar Orbiter on coronal and heliospheric wind simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Orbiter provides unique capabilities to understand the heliosphere. In particular, it has made observations of the far-side of the Sun and provides unique information to improve space weather monitoring. We aim to quantify how far-side data will affect simulations of the corona and the interplanetary medium, especially in the context of space weather forecasting. We focused on a time period with a single sunspot emerging on the far-side in February 2021. We used two different input magnetic maps: one with the far-side active region and one without. We used three different coronal models: a semi-empirical model (potential field source surface or PFSS) and two different magnetohydrodynamic models (Wind Predict and Wind Predict-AW). We compared all the models with both remote sensing and in situ observations. We find that the inclusion of the far-side active region in the various models has a small local impact due to the limited amount of flux of the sunspot (at most 8% of the total map flux), which leads to coronal hole changes of around 7% for all models. Interestingly, there is a more global impact on the magnetic structure seen in the current sheet, with clear changes in the coronal hole boundaries visible in extreme ultra-violet (EUV) on the western limb. For the Wind Predict-AW model, we demonstrate that the inclusion of the far-side data improves both the structure of the streamers and the connectivity to the spacecraft. In conclusion, the inclusion of a single far-side active region may have a small local effect with respect to the total magnetic flux, but it has global effects on the magnetic structure, and thus it must be taken into account to accurately describe the Sun-Earth connection. The flattening of the heliospheric current sheet for all models reveals an increase of the source surface height, which affects the open and closed magnetic field line distributions.</description>

      <title>Probing the shape of the brown dwarf desert around main-sequence A-F-G-type stars using post-common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) possessing masses within the range $40-60 M_{\rm Jup}$ are rare around solar-type main-sequence (MS) stars, which gives rise to the brown dwarf desert (BDD). One caveat associated with previous studies of BDD is the relatively limited sample size of MS$-$BD binaries with accurately determined BD masses. We aim to produce a large sample of brown dwarf companions with precisely determined mass around main-sequence A-F-G type stars using observations of post common-envelope white dwarf (WD)$-$BD binaries. We employ the rapid binary evolution code COMPAS to deduce the properties of MS$-$BD binary progenitors from post common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries. This method supplements the directly observed MS$-$BD binary sample, enriching the data available for analyzing BDD around main-sequence A-F-G type stars. Our study opens a new window for studying the shape of BDD around A-F-G type main-sequence stars in the short period regime. We find tentative evidence that the `driest' part of BDD around A-F-G type stars may extend into an orbital period of several hundred days, albeit with a small sample size. More post common-envelope WD$-$BD binaries detected in the future will advance our understanding of the BDD around A-F-G type stars.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of WD-WD mergers and the origin of RCB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of double white dwarf (DWD) mergers by performing hydrodynamic simulations using the new and improved adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. We follow the orbital evolution of DWD systems of mass ratio q=0.7 for tens of orbits until and after the merger to investigate them as a possible origin for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) type stars. We reproduce previous results, finding that during the merger, the Helium WD donor star is tidally disrupted within 20-80 minutes since the beginning of the simulation onto the accretor Carbon-Oxygen WD, creating a high temperature shell around the accretor. We investigate the possible Helium burning in this shell and the merged object's general structure. Specifically, we are interested in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredged-up to the hot shell and the amount of Oxygen-18 produced. This is critical as the discovery of very low Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios in RCB stars pointed out the merger scenario as a favorable explanation for their origin. A small amount of hydrogen in the donor may help keep the Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios within observational bounds, even if moderate dredge-up from the accretor occurs. In addition, we perform a resolution study to reconcile the difference found in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredge-up between smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and grid-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Configuration of Active Regions Associated with GLE Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particles, generated in solar flares, sometimes can get extremely high energy, above the 500 MeV level, and produce abrupt ground level enhancements (GLEs) on the ground-based detectors of cosmic rays. The initial flares are strong eruptions and they should be originated from active regions (ARs). A list of GLE events and associated flares was initially available, and our aim here was to find the hosting AR for each GLE event. Moreover, we aimed to classify the revealed ARs using the magneto-morphological classification (MMC: \citealp{2021MNRAS.507.3698A}). We have shown that in 94\% of cases such ARs belong to the most complex morphological classes, namely, $\beta \gamma$, $\beta \delta$, $\gamma \delta$, $\beta \gamma \delta$ classes by the Hale classification and B2, B3 classes by the MMC. We also found that the GLE-associated ARs are the ARs with the total unsigned magnetic flux much stronger than the common ARs of the same complexity. The set of GLE-related ARs only partially overlaps with the set of SARs (super-active regions). These ARs seem to be a manifestation of nonlinearities in the regular process of the global mean-field dynamo, the key ingredient to keep fluctuations and to create critical conditions in different aspects of the solar activity.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions of Photospheric Magnetic Fields in Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used magnetograms acquired with the {\it Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager} (HMI) on board the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO) to calculate and analyze spatial correlation functions and the multi-fractal spectra in solar active regions (ARs). The analysis was performed for two very different types of ARs: i) simple bipolar magnetic structures with regular orientation (the magneto-morphological class A1), and ii) very complex multi-polar ARs (the magneto-morphological class B3). All ARs were explored at the developed phase during flareless periods. For correlation functions, the power-law and exponential approximations were calculated and compared. It was found that the exponential law holds for the correlation functions of both types of ARs within spatial scales of 1-36~Mm, while the power law failed to approximate the observed correlation functions. The property of multi-fractality was found in all ARs, being better pronounced for the complex B3-class ARs. Our results might imply that photospheric magnetic fields of an AR is a self-organized system, which, however, does not exhibit properties of self-organized criticality (SOC), and its fractal properties are an attribute of more broad (than SOC only) class of non-linear systems.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional, geometrically stratified semi-empirical models of the quiet-Sun photosphere and lower chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional, semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere are widely employed in numerous contexts within solar physics, ranging from the determination of element abundances and atomic parameters to studies of the solar irradiance and from Stokes inversions to coronal extrapolations. These models provide the physical parameters (i.e. temperature, gas pressure, etc.) in the solar atmosphere as a function of the continuum optical depth $\tau_{\rm c}$. The transformation to the geometrical $z$ scale (i.e. vertical coordinate) is provided via vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Our aim is to provide updated, one-dimensional, semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere as a function of $z,$ but employing the more general case of three-dimensional magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium (MHS) instead of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). We employed a recently developed Stokes inversion code that, along with non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, considers MHS instead of HE. This code is applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations of the quiet Sun obtained with the CRISP instrument attached to the Swedish Solar Telescope. We provide average models for granules, intergranules, dark magnetic elements, and overall quiet-Sun as a function of both $\tau_{\rm c}$ and $z$ from the photosphere to the lower chromosphere. We demonstrate that, in these quiet-Sun models, the effect of considering MHS instead of HE is negligible. However, employing MHS increases the consistency of the inversion results before averaging. We surmise that in regions with stronger magnetic fields (i.e. pores, sunspots, network) the benefits of employing the magneto-hydrostatic approximation will be much more palpable.</description>

      <title>An efficient tidal dissipation mechanism via stellar magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that inwardly propagating internal gravity waves (IGWs) within a star can be fully converted to outward magnetic waves (MWs) if they encounter a sufficiently strong magnetic field. The resulting magnetic waves dissipate as they propagate outward to regions with lower Alfv\'{e}n velocity. While tidal forcing is known to excite IGWs, this conversion and subsequent damping of magnetic waves has not been explored as a tidal dissipation mechanism. In particular, stars with sufficiently strong magnetic fields could fully dissipate tidally excited waves, yielding the same tidal evolution as the previously-studied ``travelling wave regime''. Here, we evaluate the viability of this mechanism using stellar models of stars with convective cores (F-type stars in the mass range of $1.2$-$1.6M_\odot$) which were previously thought to be weakly tidally dissipative (due to the absence of nonlinear gravity wave breaking). The criterion for wave conversion to operate is evaluated for each stellar mass using the properties of each star's interior along with estimates of the magnetic field produced by a convective core dynamo under the assumption of equipartition between kinetic (convective) and magnetic energies. Our main result is that this previously unexplored source of efficient tidal dissipation can operate in stars within this mass range for significant fractions of their lifetimes. This tidal dissipation mechanism appears to be consistent with the observed inspiral of WASP-12b, and more generally could play an important role in the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters -- and to lower mass ultra-short period planets -- orbiting F-type stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing high-cadence and continuous g- and r-band data over three nights acquired from the 3.6-meter Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) aimed to find short-duration microlensing events, we conduct a systematic search for variables, transients, and asteroids across a $\sim1^\circ$ field of view of the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31). We present a catalog of 5859 variable stars, yielding the most extensive compilation of short-period variable sources of M 31. We also detected 19 flares, predominantly associated with foreground M dwarfs in the Milky Way. In addition, we discovered 17 previously unknown asteroid candidates, and we subsequently reported them to the Minor Planet Center. Lastly, we report a microlensing event candidate C-ML-1 and present a preliminary analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Survey of Faint Planetary-Nebula Nuclei. IV. The Abell 35-Type Central Star of Pa 27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical spectroscopy of the 12th-mag central star of the planetary nebula (PN) Patchick 27 (Pa 27), obtained during a survey of faint PN nuclei (PNNi) with the Low-Resolution Spectrograph (LRS2) of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The optical spectrum of Pa 27 is that of a K0 III red giant with rotationally broadened lines. However, the star is detected in the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) with GALEX, showing that a hot binary component is also present. The spectral-energy distribution from the near-UV to the mid-infrared can be fitted with a combination of the K0 III giant and a hot PNN with an effective temperature of about 50,000 K. Photometric observations of Pa 27, both ground-based and from TESS, show a low-amplitude sinusoidal variation with a period of 7.36 days, probably due to starspots on a rotating and magnetically active cool giant. Pa 27 is a new member of the rare class of "Abell 35-type central stars," which are binary PNNi consisting of a spotted late-type star and a hot pre-white dwarf. They are likely the result of a situation where an AGB star ejects its outer layers in a dense wind, part of which is captured by a distant companion, spinning up its rotation by accretion of material and angular momentum. We suggest several useful follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Star Cluster Formation: Mergers in Gas Rich Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform high resolution simulations of forming star clusters as they merge inside giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using hydrodynamics coupled to N-body dynamics to simultaneously model both the gas and stars. We zoom in to previously run GMC simulations and resolve clusters into their stellar and gas components while including the surrounding GMC environment. We find that GMC gas is important in facilitating the growth of clusters in their embedded phase by promoting cluster mergers. Mergers induce asymmetric expansion of the stellar component of the clusters in our simulations. As well, mergers induce angular momentum in the clusters' stellar and gas components. We find that mergers can lead to an increase in the amount of dense gas present in clusters if a background gas distribution is present. We predict that this can lead to new star formation that can change the overall distribution of cluster stars in velocity space. Our results suggest that subcluster mergers in the presence of background gas can imprint dynamical signatures that can be used to constrain cluster formation histories.</description>

      <title>PROJECT-J: JWST observations of HH46~IRS and its outflow. Overview and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of the JWST program PROJECT-J (PROtostellar JEts Cradle Tested with JWST ), designed to study the Class I source HH46 IRS and its outflow through NIRSpec and MIRI spectroscopy (1.66 to 28 micron). The data provide line-images (~ 6.6" in length with NIRSpec, and up to 20" with MIRI) revealing unprecedented details within the jet, the molecular outflow and the cavity. We detect, for the first time, the red-shifted jet within ~ 90 au from the source. Dozens of shock-excited forbidden lines are observed, including highly ionized species such as [Ne III] 15.5 micron, suggesting that the gas is excited by high velocity (&gt; 80 km/s) shocks in a relatively high density medium. Images of H2 lines at different excitations outline a complex molecular flow, where a bright cavity, molecular shells, and a jet-driven bow-shock interact with and are shaped by the ambient conditions. Additional NIRCam 2 micron images resolve the HH46 IRS ~ 110 au binary system and suggest that the large asymmetries observed between the jet and the H2 wide angle emission could be due to two separate outflows being driven by the two sources. The spectra of the unresolved binary show deep ice bands and plenty of gaseous lines in absorption, likely originating in a cold envelope or disk. In conclusion, JWST has unraveled for the first time the origin of the HH46 IRS complex outflow demonstrating its capability to investigate embedded regions around young stars, which remain elusive even at near-IR wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Spectrum of the Disk around the Forming Companion GQ Lup B Revealed by JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07086</link>

Abstract: GQ Lup B is a forming brown dwarf companion ($M\sim10-30~M_J$) showing evidence for an infrared excess associated with a disk surronding the companion itself. Here we present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of GQ Lup B with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) on JWST, spanning $4.8-11.7~\mu$m. We remove the stellar contamination using reference differential imaging based on principal component analysis (PCA), demonstrating that the MRS can perform high-contrast science. Our observations provide a sensitive probe of the disk surrounding GQ Lup B. We find no sign of a silicate feature, similar to other disk surrounding very low mass objects, which likely implies significant grain growth ($a_{\mathrm{min}}\gtrsim5~\mu$m), and potentially dust settling. Additionally, we find that if the emission is dominated by an inner wall, the disk around the companion might have an inner cavity larger than the one set by sublimation. Conversely, if our data probe the emission from a thin flat disk, we find the disk to be very compact. More observations are required to confirm this finding and assess the vertical structure of the disk. This approach paves the path to the future study of circumplanetary disks and their physical properties. Our results demonstrate that MIR spectroscopic observations can reveal the physical characteristics of disks around forming companions, providing unique insights into the formation of giant planets, brown dwarfs and their satellites.</description>

      <title>Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe</title>

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Polluting White Dwarfs with Oort Cloud Comets</title>

Abstract: Observations point to old white dwarfs (WDs) accreting metals at a relatively constant rate over 8~Gyrs. Exo-Oort clouds around WDs have been proposed as potential reservoirs of materials, with galactic tide as a mechanism to deliver distant comets to the WD's Roche limit. In this work, we characterise the dynamics of comets around a WD with a companion having semi-major axes on the orders of 10 - 100 AU. We develop simulation techniques capable of integrating a large number ($10^8$) of objects over a 1 Gyr timescale. Our simulations include galactic tide and are capable of resolving close-interactions with a massive companion. Through simulations, we study the accretion rate of exo-Oort cloud comets into a WD's Roche limit. We also characterise the dynamics of precession and scattering induced on a comet by a massive companion. We find that (i) WD pollution by an exo-Oort cloud can be sustained over a Gyr timescale, (ii) an exo-Oort cloud with structure like our own Solar System's is capable of delivering materials into an isolated WD with pollution rate $\sim 10^8 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, (iii) adding a planetary-mass companion reduces the pollution rate to $\sim 10^7 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, and (iv) if the companion is stellar-mass, with $M_p \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot$, the pollution rate reduces to $\sim 3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$ due to a combination of precession induced on a comet by the companion, a strong scattering barrier, and low-likelihood of direct collisions of comets with the companion.</description>

      <title>Study of 26 Galactic open clusters with extended main-sequence turnoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that some Galactic open clusters (OCs) exhibit extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) in their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). However, the number of Galactic OCs with eMSTO structures detected so far is limited, and the reasons for their formation are still unclear. This work identifies 26 Galactic OCs with undiscovered eMSTOs and investigates the causes of these features. Stellar population types and fundamental parameters of cluster samples are acquired using CMD fitting methods. Among them, the results of 11 OCs are reliable as the observed CMDs are well-reproduced. We propose the crucial role of stellar binarity and confirm the importance of stellar rotation in reproducing eMSTO morphologies. The results also show that the impact of age spread is important, as it can adequately explain the structure of young OCs and fit the observed CMDs of intermediate-age OCs better.</description>

      <title>A gravitational constant transition within cepheids as supernovae calibrators can solve the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) using SNe Ia with Cepheids as calibrators yield a value of H0 which is in tension with the value inferred from the CMB and other higher redshift probes. In ref. [1], the authors proposed a rapid transition in the value of the effective Newtonian gravitational constant G in order to alleviate the Hubble tension. The transition point was chosen so as to only affect distance estimates to Hubble flow SNe. However, in this study, the authors made the assumption that SNe Ia peak luminosity $L$ increases with Chandrashekhar mass $M_c$. This hypothesis contradicts a previous semi-analytic study of SN light curves in the presence of G-transition [2] which found that $L\propto M_c^{-0.97}$. Motivated by the results of refs. [1] and [2], we propose a hypothesis of a sudden recent change in the effective G at an epoch which corresponds to a look-back distance between $\sim$ 7 - 80 Mpc. A transition in G at these distances would affect both our estimate of the distances to Cepheids in calibrator galaxies, as well as to the Hubble flow supernovae. Upon fitting the observational data to this hypothesis, we find three interesting results: (i) we find mild evidence for a G-transition at 22.4 Mpc (73 million years ago) which is preferred (using certain estimators) by the calibrator type Ia SNe data over no G-transition, (ii) the H0 parameter inferred under this hypothesis is in good agreement with the value obtained from the CMB for a 4% larger value of G at earlier times, thus potentially resolving the Hubble tension, (iii) we obtain a fit to the scaling relationship between SN peak luminosity $L$ and Chandrasekhar mass $M_c$, as $L\propto M_c^{-1.68 \pm 0.68}$, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the theoretical study of ref. [2]. We also discuss how other probes could be used to verify this transition in the value of G.</description>
