      <title>Mesoscale tissue properties and electric fields in brain stimulation: Bridging the macroscopic and microscopic scales using layer-specific cortical conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of electric fields (E-fields) in neural stimulation depend on tissue conductivity representations that link underlying microscopic tissue structure with macroscopic assumptions. Mesoscale conductivity variations can produce meaningful changes in E-fields and neural activation thresholds but remain largely absent from standard macroscopic models. Conductivity variations within the cortex are expected given the differences in cell density and volume fraction across layers. We review recent efforts modeling microscopic and mesoscopic E-fields and outline approaches that bridge micro- and macroscales to derive consistent mesoscale conductivity distributions. Using simplified microscopic models, effective tissue conductivity was estimated as a function of volume fraction of extracellular space, and the conductivities of different cortical layers were interpolated based on experimental volume fraction. The effective tissue conductivities were monotonically decreasing convex functions of the cell volume fraction. With decreasing cell volume fraction, the conductivity of cortical layers increased with depth from layer 2 to 6. Although the variation of conductivity within the cortex was small when compared to the conductivity of extracellular fluid (9% to 15%), the conductivity difference was considerably larger when compared between layers, e.g., with layer 3 and 6 being 20% and 50% more conductive than layer 2, respectively. The review and analysis provide a foundation for accurate multiscale models of E-fields and neural stimulation. Using layer-specific conductivity values within the cortex could improve the accuracy of estimations of thresholds and distributions of neural activation in E-field models of brain stimulation.</description>

      <title>Axonal microstructure and compartmentalization impact the orientation and time dependence of mesoscopic transverse relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biological tissue, MR transverse relaxation stems from mechanisms spanning multiple scales, from molecular dipole-dipole interactions to mesoscopic field variations driven by tissue microstructure. While mesoscopic relaxation reflects cellular organization, its dynamics in white matter, specifically its dependence on axonal orientation and echo time, remain less investigated. This study employs theoretical frameworks and Monte-Carlo simulations using 3D EM-based white matter (WM) geometries to investigate how compartmentalization and realistic morphology drive these effects. Specifically, we simulate intra-axonal relaxation driven by magnetic fields induced by realistic axonal myelin sheaths and intra-axonal spheres as a model of iron-containing mitochondria. Our results confirm that orientation dependence of mesoscopic relaxation in WM is detectable and agrees with experimental observations. The time-dependence aligns with 1-dimensional short-range structural disorder, but at clinical echo times, this signature may be masked by dominant molecular relaxation. This work moves beyond idealized models to aid the development of more specific biophysical models of mesoscopic relaxation to achieve better biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multistable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>
