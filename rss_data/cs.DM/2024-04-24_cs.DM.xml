      <title>On the sizes of BDDs and ZDDs representing matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matroids are often represented as oracles since there are no unified and compact representations for general matroids. This paper initiates the study of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs) as relatively compact data structures for representing matroids in a computer. This study particularly focuses on the sizes of BDDs and ZDDs representing matroids. First, we compare the sizes of different variations of BDDs and ZDDs for a matroid. These comparisons involve concise transformations between specific decision diagrams. Second, we provide upper bounds on the size of BDDs and ZDDs for several classes of matroids. These bounds are closely related to the number of minors of the matroid and depend only on the connectivity function or pathwidth of the matroid, which deeply relates to the classes of matroids called strongly pigeonhole classes. In essence, these results indicate upper bounds on the number of minors for specific classes of matroids and new strongly pigeonhole classes.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article utilizes the inspiration to apply the Wyel operators for producing the Kraus operators, which are crucial in the discrete-time open quantum walk. It assists us in extending the idea of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs. We make the new model of quantum walk useful to build up a quantum PageRank algorithm. In classical computation, Google's PageRank is a significant algorithm for arranging web pages on the World Wide Web. In general, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also represents the importance of the vertices of a network. We can compute the new quantum PageRank algorithm in polynomial time using a classical computer. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erdos-Renyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, random-k-out graph, binary tree graph, GNC network, Barabasi and Albert network, etc.</description>

      <title>$\alpha_i$-Metric Graphs: Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is called $\alpha_i$-metric ($i \in {\cal N}$) if it satisfies the following $\alpha_i$-metric property for every vertices $u, w, v$ and $x$: if a shortest path between $u$ and $w$ and a shortest path between $x$ and $v$ share a terminal edge $vw$, then $d(u,x) \ge d(u,v) + d(v,x) - i$. The latter is a discrete relaxation of the property that in Euclidean spaces the union of two geodesics sharing a terminal segment must be also a geodesic. Recently in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, WG'23) we initiated the study of the algorithmic applications of $\alpha_i$-metric graphs. Our results in this prior work were very similar to those established in (Chepoi et al., SoCG'08) and (Chepoi et al., COCOA'18) for graphs with bounded hyperbolicity. The latter is a heavily studied metric tree-likeness parameter first introduced by Gromov. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between hyperbolicity and the $\alpha_i$-metric property, proving that $\alpha_i$-metric graphs are $f(i)$-hyperbolic for some function $f$ linear in $i$. We give different proofs of this result, using various equivalent definitions to graph hyperbolicity. By contrast, we give simple constructions of $1$-hyperbolic graphs that are not $\alpha_i$-metric for any constant $i$. Finally, in the special case of $i=1$, we prove that $\alpha_1$-metric graphs are $1$-hyperbolic, and the bound is sharp. By doing so, we can answer some questions left open in (Dragan &amp; Ducoffe, WG'23).</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $t$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance greater than $t$. A $t$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,t)$ and $K(n,t)$ be the maximum size of a $t$-Cayley and a $t$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2t}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^t}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>

      <title>All You Need is Resistance: On the Equivalence of Effective Resistance and Certain Optimal Transport Problems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Linear Search for an Escaping Target with Unknown Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider linear search for an escaping target whose speed and initial position are unknown to the searcher. A searcher (an autonomous mobile agent) is initially placed at the origin of the real line and can move with maximum speed $1$ in either direction along the line. An oblivious mobile target that is moving away from the origin with an unknown constant speed $v&lt;1$ is initially placed by an adversary on the infinite line at distance $d$ from the origin in an unknown direction. We consider two cases, depending on whether $d$ is known or unknown. The main contribution of this paper is to prove a new lower bound and give algorithms leading to new upper bounds for search in these settings. This results in an optimal (up to lower order terms in the exponent) competitive ratio in the case where $d$ is known and improved upper and lower bounds for the case where $d$ is unknown. Our results solve an open problem proposed in [Coleman et al., Proc. OPODIS 2022].</description>

      <title>The structure of quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor with applications to the domino problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. In this paper we obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph $G$ avoiding a minor has a tree-decomposition whose torsos are finite or planar; moreover the tree-decomposition is canonical, i.e. invariant under the action of the automorphism group of $G$. As applications of this result, we prove the following.
  * Every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This extends a result of Thomassen (1992) who proved it in the 4-connected case and suggested that this assumption could be omitted.
  * Locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor are accessible (in the sense of Thomassen and Woess), which extends known results on planar graphs to any proper minor-closed family.
  * Minor-excluded finitely generated groups are accessible (in the group-theoretic sense) and finitely presented, which extends classical results on planar groups.
  * The domino problem is decidable in a minor-excluded finitely generated group if and only if the group is virtually free, which proves the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018).</description>

      <title>An Algorithm to Recover Shredded Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given some binary matrix $M$, suppose we are presented with the collection of its rows and columns in independent arbitrary orderings. From this information, are we able to recover the unique original orderings and matrix? We present an algorithm that identifies whether there is a unique ordering associated with a set of rows and columns, and outputs either the unique correct orderings for the rows and columns or the full collection of all valid orderings and valid matrices. We show that there is a constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the algorithm terminates in $O(n^2)$ time with high probability and in expectation for random $n \times n$ binary matrices with i.i.d.\ Bernoulli $(p)$ entries $(m_{ij})_{ij=1}^n$ such that $\frac{c\log^2(n)}{n(\log\log(n))^2} \leq p \leq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>A near-optimal zero-free disk for the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The partition function of the Ising model of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)=\sum_{\sigma:V\to \{0,1\}} b^{m(\sigma)}$, where $m(\sigma)$ denotes the number of edges $e=\{u,v\}$ such that $\sigma(u)=\sigma(v)$. We show that for any positive integer $\Delta$ and any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)\neq 0$ for all $b\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying $|\frac{b-1}{b+1}| \leq \frac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ (where $o_\Delta(1) \to 0$ as $\Delta\to \infty$). This is optimal in the sense that $\tfrac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ cannot be replaced by $\tfrac{c}{\Delta-1}$ for any constant $c &gt; 1$ subject to a complexity theoretic assumption.
  To prove our result we use a standard reformulation of the partition function of the Ising model as the generating function of even sets. We establish a zero-free disk for this generating function inspired by techniques from statistical physics on partition functions of a polymer models. Our approach is quite general and we discuss extensions of it to a certain types of polymer models.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph $G$, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, $M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time.
  In this work we study the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and the number of particles is $M=n/2+\alpha n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2})$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. This choice of $M$ corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by $n^{-1/2}$, converges in $p$-th mean, as $n\rightarrow \infty$ and for any $p \in \mathbb{R}$, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable $T_\alpha$. We find that $T_\alpha$ is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that $\mathbb{E}[T_0] = \pi^{3/2}/\sqrt{7}$, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when $|\alpha|$ gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by $n\ln n$, it converges to $2/7$ in probability.</description>
