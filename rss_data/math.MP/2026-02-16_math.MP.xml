      <title>When Stein-Type Test Detects Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the probability distribution of finite N-body systems, which maximises the Havrda--Charv\'at entropy, we build a Stein-type goodness-of-fit test. The Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution is exact only in the thermodynamic limit, where the system is composed of infinitely many particles as N approaches infinity. For an isolated system with a finite number of particles, the equilibrium velocity distribution is compact and markedly non-Gaussian, being restricted by the fixed total energy. Using Stein's method, we first obtain a differential operator that characterises the target density. Its eigenfunctions are symmetric Jacobi polynomials, whose orthogonality yields a simple, parameter-free statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the data follows the finite-N distribution, the statistic converges to a chi-squared law, so critical values are available in closed form. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments confirm exact size control and give a clear picture of the power. These findings quantify how quickly a finite system approaches the classical limit and provide a practical tool for testing kinetic models in regimes where normality cannot be assumed.</description>

      <title>A Cluster Expansion and the Decay of Correlations of the 1D Long-Range Ising Model at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a convergent low-temperature cluster expansion of the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model with polynomial decay $\alpha\in (1,2]$ is developed; that is, $J(r)=r^{-\alpha}$. As an application, the $n$-point correlations are studied and the two-point correlation is shown to be algebraic with rate of decay exactly $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of Insulators: III. Non-interacting Spectrally-Gapped Systems in All Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-interacting electrons in disordered materials which exhibit a spectral gap, in each of the ten Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, in all space dimensions. We define an appropriate space of Hamiltonians and a topology on it so that the so-called strong topological invariants become complete invariants yielding the Kitaev periodic table, but now derived as the set of path-connected components of the space of Hamiltonians, rather than as $K$-theory groups. We thus confirm the conjecture regarding a one-to-one correspondence between topological phases of gapped non-interacting systems and the respective Abelian groups $\{0\},\mathbb{Z},2\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the spectral gap regime. We do this by providing the appropriate notion of locality, as well as a novel, so-called bulk non-triviality, which together reproduce the Kitaev table. Once the natural definitions are identified, the main technical achievement is lifting $K$-theory calculations to $\pi_0$ of unitaries and projections.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Localization for General Scattering Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum walks defined on arbitrary infinite graphs, parameterized by a family of scattering matrices attached to the vertices. Multiplying each scattering matrix by an i.i.d. random phase, we obtain a random scattering quantum walk. We prove dynamical localization for random scattering walks in a large-disorder regime. The result is based on a relation between fractional moment estimates and eigenfunction correlators of independent interest, which we establish for general random unitary operators.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics and defect expansions for polynomial PDEs on thin annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric and analytic framework for polynomial partial differential equations posed on thin annuli in the plane. Using renormalized Sobolev inner products, we construct Sobolev orthogonal polynomial bases adapted to the thin geometry and use them to define stable Galerkin approximations.
  We prove a general dimension-reduction theorem for polynomial Hamiltonian and dissipative PDEs, showing that solutions converge to effective one-dimensional dynamics on the limiting circle. Beyond the leading-order limit, we identify transverse defect correctors and derive cell problems describing anisotropic dispersive and homogenized effects.
  Our framework applies uniformly to integrable models (KdV, modified KdV, nonlinear Schr\"odinger, sine--Gordon), anisotropic dispersive systems such as Zakharov--Kuznetsov, and non-integrable perturbations including dissipation, forcing, and rapidly oscillating coefficients. We establish stability of the effective dynamics under changes of Sobolev order and of polynomial Hilbert geometry, and show robustness of the associated Galerkin schemes.
  The results provide a unified geometric perspective on dimension reduction, homogenization, and integrability in thin geometries, and introduce Sobolev orthogonal polynomial methods as a constructive tool for multiscale PDE analysis.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Gapped States and Symmetry-Enforced Gaplessness in 3-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing the infrared (IR) phases of a fermionic quantum theory in three spatial dimensions, based on its quantum anomalies associated with a finite symmetry. We uncover a fundamental dichotomy among these anomalies: the first class of anomalies can always be realized by symmetric gapped states, while the second class can never be realized by gapped states without breaking the given symmetry, establishing the phenomenon of symmetry-enforced gaplessness in these settings. Moreover, using the construction of symmetry extension, we construct the candidate gapped states that theories with the first class of anomalies can flow to in the IR. As an application, we provide concrete predictions of the candidate IR phases of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theories based on our results. Our results also suggest that systems with discrete chiral anomalies cannot be gapped out by adding arbitrary bosonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a preliminary version of a book on infinite-dimensional Lie groups. It covers the basics of calculus and manifolds in the context of locally convex spaces, based on Bastiani's notion of a smooth map. Starting from this concept, we develop the basics of smooth manifolds and define Lie groups as manifolds with smooth group operations. We discuss in particular several classes of Lie groups, such as regular ones, or those with an exponential function that is a local diffeomorphism. The local theory, subgroups and quotients are explored in some detail. Classes of Lie groups that are discussed in detail include: unit groups of continuous inverse algebras, groups of smooth maps, direct limit groups and groups of diffeomorphism. We also included chapters on the topology of infinite-dimensional Lie group and on various selected topics.</description>

      <title>Splitting Gibbs Measures for a Periodic Triple Mixed-Spin Ising Model on a Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an Ising model on the Cayley tree $\Gamma_k$ of arbitrary order $k\ge1$ with three spin species of values $(\tfrac12,1,\tfrac32)$ distributed deterministically with period three along the generations. Within the framework of splitting Gibbs measures, we derive the exact boundary-law compatibility equations and characterize translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) via a finite system of algebraic relations. In the ferromagnetic regime $J&gt;0$, writing $\theta=\exp(\beta J/2)$, we further reduce the translation-invariant problem to a one-dimensional scalar fixed-point equation $x=f(x,\theta,k)$ for a rational map $f$. We show that $f$ is strictly increasing and obtain an explicit sufficient condition for phase coexistence: if $s_k(\theta)=f'(1,\theta,k)-1&gt;0$, then $x=f(x,\theta,k)$ admits at least three distinct positive solutions, yielding at least three distinct TISGMs and hence a phase transition driven by the periodic inhomogeneity of the spin structure.
  For the binary tree $k=2$ we exploit attractiveness to construct plus and minus Gibbs measures as weak limits with extremal boundary conditions, prove that they are TISGMs corresponding to the minimal and maximal fixed points of $f(\cdot,\theta,2)$, and show that they are the minimal and maximal Gibbs measures in the natural stochastic order. Finally, we construct the tree-indexed Markov chain associated with a TISGM and apply the Kesten--Stigum criterion to the disordered TISGM, identifying nonempty parameter regions where this measure is non-extremal and reconstruction occurs.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons factorization algebras and knot polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work identifies the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of links in terms of a trace map on factorization homology. In particular, to recover the knot invariants associated to Chern-Simons theories, we construct a filtered $\mathcal{E}_3$-algebra $\mathcal{A}^\lambda$ by BV quantization of Chern-Simons theory for a semi-simple Lie algebra ${\frak g}$ with invariant pairing~$\lambda$, and we prove that a finite-dimensional representation $V$ of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group $U_\hbar{\frak g}$ defines a perfect $\mathcal{A}^\lambda$ module~$\mathcal{V}$. For any framed link $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we then prove that there is an equality \[\int_{K\subset\mathbb{R}^3}{\rm tr}(V) = Z_V(K\subset\mathbb{R}^3) \] between the factorization homology trace for $V$ and the Reshetikhin-Turaev link invariant determined by~$V$.</description>

      <title>Bicovariant Codifferential Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a technique for studying first-order codifferential calculi initiated by Doi and Quillen in the context of cyclic cohomology. Introducing the concept of first-order codifferential calculi (FOCCs) for a given coalgebra, we can show that their classification can be reduced to the classification of subbicomodules in the universal bicomodule. For completing this task, the role of one-dimensional generating spaces (a.k.a. singletons) is found to be useful. We are particularly interested in classifying bicovariant codifferential calculi, which we define over Hopf algebras. This, in turn, can be reduced to classifying Yetter-Drinfeld submodules. We argue that such codifferential calculi are better suited to Drinfeld-type quantized enveloping algebras, as they are dual to Woronowicz calculi for matrix quantum groups. Some classification results are presented in numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic billiards and bounded motion in cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely used mathematical model for the bouncing motion of an ideally elastic ball -- referred to in previous work by the first two authors and collaborators as a {\em no-slip billiard} system -- exhibits some notable dynamical behavior that is not well-understood. For example, under certain initial conditions, the axial component of the position of the center of the ball moving inside a vertical solid cylinder under constant gravitational force does not accelerate downward as might be expected but remains bounded. There is not as yet, as far as we know, any analytical study of the bouncing ball dynamics, under gravity, in general cylinders (not necessarily having a circular cross-section) in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this paper, we propose an approach by comparing the no-slip system with a smooth approximation of it that we call {\em nonholonomic billiards}. It consists of a $4$-dimensional ball rolling on the solid $3$-dimensional cylinder.
  We first review earlier work on no-slip billiards and their connection with nonholonomic (rolling) systems, explain how nonholonomic billiards approximate the no-slip kind (after work by the first two authors and B. Zhao), and illustrate the relationship with a few numerical case studies that demonstrate the utility of the soft (nonholonomic) system as a helpful tool for exploring the dynamics of no-slip billiard systems.</description>

      <title>Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the recent progress in defining open enumerative theories for Landau-Ginzburg models. We illustrate the ideas required to develop these new foundations. In particular, we describe how to define the open enumerative invariants as integrals of multisections of certain vector bundles over a moduli space that is a real orbifold with corners, after prescribing boundary conditions for the multisections. We then explain the known situations where the open invariants satisfy certain forms of topological recursion relations, integrable hierarchies, or mirror symmetry. We end with a list of open questions and problems.</description>

      <title>Fractional $k$-positivity: a continuous refinement of the $k$-positive scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a real-parameter refinement of the classical integer hierarchies underlying Schmidt number, block-positivity, and $k$-positivity for maps between matrix algebras. Starting from a compact family of $\alpha$-admissible unit vectors ($\alpha\in[1,d]$), we define closed cones $\mathsf K_\alpha$ of bipartite positive operators that interpolate strictly between successive Schmidt-number cones, together with their dual witness cones. Via the Choi--Jamio\l{}kowski correspondence this yields a matching filtration of map cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$, recovering the usual $k$-positive/$k$-superpositive classes at integer parameters and complete positivity at the top endpoint.
  Two results show that the fractional levels capture genuinely new structure. First, we prove a \emph{fractional Kraus theorem}: $\alpha$-superpositive maps are precisely the completely positive maps admitting a Kraus decomposition whose Kraus operators satisfy an explicit singular-value (Ky--Fan) constraint, extending the classical rank-$k$ characterization. Second, for non-integer $\alpha$ the cones $\mathsf P_\alpha$ fail stability under CP post-composition, highlighting a sharp structural transition away from the integer theory. Finally, we derive sharp thresholds on canonical symmetric families (including the depolarizing ray and the isotropic slice), turning familiar stepwise criteria into continuous, computable profiles.</description>

Abstract: We consider the most general parity symmetric effective scalar tensor theory in four dimensions containing terms up to fourth derivative order in the Lagrangian. It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.</description>

      <title>Conformal bi-Hamiltonian structure and integrability of an interacting Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator with a Landau-Ginzburg type interaction term and analyse its classical dynamics from a geometric and numerical point of view. We show that the resulting fourth-order equation of motion admits a conformal bi-Hamiltonian formulation, possesses a non-trivial set of Lie symmetries and we demonstrate the existence of bounded and regular trajectories in representative parameter regimes. By establishing an explicit correspondence with an integrable generalised H\'enon-Heiles system, we show that the interacting higher-derivative dynamics inherits the integrability properties of the latter. This connection allows us to construct a second conserved Hamiltonian, to clarify the geometric origin of separability, and to obtain explicit classical solutions in terms of elliptic functions. Our results provide a concrete example of an interacting higher-derivative system for which integrability and periodic classical solutions can be established in a fully explicit manner.</description>

      <title>A Variational Formulation for Deformable Particle Simulations and its Level Set Discrete Element Method Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deformable Discrete Element Method (DEM) that extends the classical rigid-particle formulation through a reduced-order description of elastic grain-scale deformation. The method hinges on two developments. First, an energetic variational formulation based on the Lagrange--d'Alembert principle extends classical rigid-body dynamics to incorporate particle deformability by embedding translational, rotational, and deformation degrees of freedom within a unified energetic description. Second, particle deformation is realized within the Level Set DEM formalism through evolving level sets. The framework applies broadly to general particle geometries and topologies, and supports arbitrary deformation modes. The resulting deformable DEM retains the robustness, geometric and physical clarity, and scalability of classical DEM, while enabling physically grounded grain-scale deformability at a computational cost of the same order of magnitude as rigid DEM. Comparisons with full finite-element simulations demonstrate excellent agreement at both particle and system scales, establishing a general and extensible variational framework for modeling deformation in particulate systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, a group-theoretical introduction to BMS symmetries is provided in a self-contained manner. More precisely, all definitions and structures are purely based on geometrical and group-theoretical notions defined at null infinity and valid in any dimension, in a way that circumvents its traditional bulk realisation as asymptotic symmetries. The topics which are reviewed are: the definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence between good cut subspaces and Poincar\'e subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.</description>

      <title>Structure preservation using discrete gradients in the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel structure-preserving framework for solving the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system of equations using a particle in cell (PIC) discretization combined with discrete gradient time integrators. The Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system is an accurate model for studying hot plasma dynamics at a kinetic scale where small-angle Coulomb collisions dominate. Our scheme guarantees conservation of mass, momentum and energy as well as preservation of the monotonicity of entropy production in both the time-continuous and discrete systems. We employ the conservative integrator for both the Hamiltonian Vlasov-Poisson equations and the dissipative Landau equation using the PETSc library (www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) to showcase structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Theory of Steady States for Lindblad Equations beyond Time-Independence: Classification, Uniqueness and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schr\"odinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schr\"odinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.</description>

      <title>Stronger Welch Bounds and Optimal Approximate $k$-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.</description>

      <title>Structural barriers of the discrete Hasimoto map applied to protein backbone geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino-acid sequence remains a fundamental problem in biophysics. The discrete Frenet geometry of the C$_\alpha$ backbone can be mapped, via a Hasimoto-type transform, onto a complex scalar field $\psi=\kappa\,e^{i\sum\tau}$ satisfying a discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS), whose soliton solutions reproduce observed secondary-structure motifs. Whether this mapping, which provides an elegant geometric description of folded states, can be extended to a predictive framework for protein folding remains an open question. We derive an exact closed-form decomposition of the DNLS effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}=V_{\text{re}}+iV_{\text{im}}$ in terms of curvature ratios and torsion angles, validating the result to machine precision across 856 non-redundant proteins. Our analysis identifies three structural barriers to forward prediction: (i)~$V_{\text{im}}$ encodes chirality via the odd symmetry of $\sin\tau$, accounting for ${\sim}31\%$ of the total information and implying a $2^N$ degeneracy if neglected; (ii)~$V_{\text{re}}$ is determined primarily (${\sim}95\%$) by local geometry, rendering it effectively sequence-agnostic; and (iii)~self-consistent field iterations fail to recover native structures (mean RMSD $= 13.1$\,\AA) even with hydrogen-bond terms, yielding torsion correlations indistinguishable from zero. Constructively, we demonstrate that the residual of the DNLS dispersion relation serves as a geometric order parameter for $\alpha$-helices (ROC AUC $= 0.72$), defining them as regions of maximal integrability. These findings establish that the Hasimoto map functions as a kinematic identity rather than a dynamical governing equation, presenting fundamental obstacles to its use as a predictive framework for protein folding.</description>

Abstract: We first carry out the soliton sector quantization of the spatially cut-off $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory with double well potential in the semiclassical limit, deriving the nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation as an equation describing the limiting soliton dynamics. In the process we prove the semiclassical mass shift formula of Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu, which is interpreted in terms of a unitary equivalence between normal ordered semiclassical quadratic Hamiltonians in two different representations of the Heisenberg relations. Secondly, we consider the $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory coupled topologically to an external electromagnetic field and prove the main result, which is an approximation theorem reminiscent of the Born-Oppenheimer method, which describes the nonrelativistic dynamics of the soliton coupled to infinitely many transverse bosonic degrees of freedom, extending the techniques of soliton modulation theory from classical to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with concentric $\delta$--shell interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^3$ with finitely many concentric spherical $\delta$-shell interactions. The operators are defined by the quadratic form method and are described by continuity across each shell together with the usual jump condition for the radial derivative. Using a boundary integral approach based on the free Green kernel and single-layer potentials, we derive an explicit resolvent representation for an arbitrary number of shells with bounded coupling strengths. This yields a concrete Kre\u{\i}n-type formula and a boundary operator whose noninvertibility characterizes the discrete spectrum, and it is compatible with a partial-wave reduction under rotational symmetry.
  We then specialize to the two-shell case with constant couplings and obtain a detailed description of the negative spectrum. In particular, we show that the ground state (when it exists) lies in the $s$-wave sector and derive an explicit secular equation for bound states. For large shell separation, each bound level approaches the corresponding single-shell level with exponentially small corrections, while a genuine tunneling splitting appears when the single-shell levels are tuned to coincide. As a simple calibration, we relate the two-shell parameters to representative core-shell quantum dot scales. At the level of order-of-magnitude and qualitative trends, Type~I configurations yield a relatively strongly confined state, whereas Type~II configurations produce a comparatively shallow outer-shell state.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Waves and the K-Condition in Viscoelastic Solids and Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The K-condition introduced by Shizuta and Kawashima provides a sufficient criterion for the global existence of smooth solutions to dissipative hyperbolic systems. For genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, a weaker K-condition becomes necessary, although not sufficient. In this paper, we analyze this weaker K-condition through the study of acceleration waves propagating in an equilibrium state. We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m&lt;1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m&gt;1$).</description>

Abstract: We investigate a category of quantum posets that generalizes the category of posets and monotone functions. Up to equivalence, its objects are hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebras equipped with quantum partial orders in Weaver's sense. We show that this category is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. As a consequence, any discrete quantum family of maps in So{\l}tan's sense from a discrete quantum space to a partially ordered set is canonically equipped with quantum preorder in Weaver's sense. In particular, the quantum power set of a quantum set is so ordered. As an application, we show that each quantum poset embeds into its quantum power set.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the spectral radius of a large random matrix $X$ with independent, identically distributed complex entries follows the Gumbel law irrespective of the distribution of the matrix elements. This solves a long-standing conjecture of Bordenave and Chafa{\"\i} and it establishes the first universality result for one of the most prominent extremal spectral statistics in random matrix theory. Furthermore, we also prove that the argument of the largest eigenvalue is uniform on the unit circle and that the extremal eigenvalues of $X$ form a Poisson point process.</description>

Abstract: In this work, exact solutions of the nonlinear cubic-quintic Duffing-van der Pol oscillator with variable coefficients are obtained. Two approaches have been applied, one based on the factorization method combined with the Field Method, and a second one relying on Painlev\'e analysis. Both procedures allow us to find the same exact solutions to the problem. The Lagrangian formalism for this system is also derived. Moreover, some examples for particular choices of the time-dependent coefficients, and their corresponding general and particular exact solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. Here we study two fundamental tasks in the processing of entanglement: entanglement testing, which is a quantum state discrimination problem concerned with entanglement detection in the many-copy regime, and entanglement distillation, concerned with purifying entanglement from noisy entangled states. We introduce a way of benchmarking the performance of distillation that focuses on the best achievable error rather than its yield in the asymptotic limit. When the underlying set of operations used for entanglement distillation is the axiomatic class of non-entangling operations, we show that the two figures of merit for entanglement testing and distillation coincide. We solve both problems by proving a generalised quantum Sanov's theorem, enabling the exact evaluation of asymptotic error rates of composite quantum hypothesis testing. We show in particular that the asymptotic figure of merit is given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state -- a distinct feature among measures of entanglement that quantify the optimal performance of information-theoretic tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and $\{\omega_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be two orthonormal bases for a finite dimensional p-adic Hilbert space $\mathcal{X}$. Let $M,N\subseteq \{1, \dots, n\}$ be such that \begin{align*} \displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|&lt;1, \end{align*} where $o(M)$ is the cardinality of $M$. Then for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, we show that \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|x\|\leq \left(\frac{1}{1-\displaystyle \max_{j \in M, k \in N}|\langle \tau_j, \omega_k \rangle|}\right)\max\left\{\displaystyle \max_{j \in M^c}|\langle x, \tau_j\rangle |, \displaystyle \max_{k \in N^c}|\langle x, \omega_k\rangle |\right\}. \end{align}
  We call Inequality (1) as \textbf{p-adic Ghobber-Jaming Uncertainty Principle}. Inequality (1) is the p-adic version of uncertainty principle obtained by Ghobber and Jaming \textit{[Linear Algebra Appl., 2011]}. We also derive analogues of Inequality (1) for non-Archimedean Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of defining the field strength of abelian potentials when the spacetime is a Poisson manifold, within the groupoidal approach. The natural definition in terms of gauge invariant momenta is proved to be equivalent to covariant and invariant tensors of a local symplectic groupoid representing a symplectic realization of the Poisson manifold. A Poisson Chern-Simons model is then proposed and its equations of motion are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and wall crossing for deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a polynomial superpotential with $\hbar$ correction. In the minimal chamber, where all turning points are real and distinct, it was shown that the exact Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin periods obey the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the undeformed potential. By changing the energy parameter above/below the critical points, the turning points become complex, and the moduli are outside of the minimal chamber. We study the wall crossing of the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended TBA equations by this change of moduli and show that the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ structure is preserved after the wall crossing. In particular, the TBA equations for the cubic superpotential are studied in detail, where there are two chambers (minimal and maximal). At the maximally symmetric point in the maximal chamber, the TBA system becomes the two sets of the $D_3$-type TBA equations, which are regarded as the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ extension of the $A_3/{\mathbb Z}_2$-type TBA equation.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang" mean? What was the actual origin of these two words? There are many aspects hidden under this name, which are seldom explained. They are discussed here. To frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. And this includes names given to outstanding theorems and spectacular discoveries, too. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled in this context. These points will be at the heart of the quest here, concerning the concept of ``Big Bang", which only a few people know what it means, actually. Fred Hoyle was the first to pronounce these words, in a BBC radio program, with a meaning that was later called inflation. But listeners were left with the image he was trying to destroy: the explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (an absolutely wrong concept). Hoyle's Steady State will be carefully compared with inflation cosmology. They are quite different, and yet, in both cases, the possibility of creating matter/energy out of expanding space is rooted in the same fundamental principles: those of General Relativity. As is also, the possibility of having a universe with zero total energy, anticipated by R.C. Tolman, in 1934 already. It will be shown, how to obtain accelerated expansion from negative pressure; how to reconcile energy conservation with matter creation in an expanding universe; and a curious relation between de Sitter spacetime and Steady State cosmology. Concerning the naming issue, it will be remarked that, today, the same label ``Big Bang" is used in very different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann to Lindblad: Classical and Quantum Approaches to Out-of-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of base norm spaces to the complex case, and further to the noncommutative setting relevant to `quantum convexity'. In particular, we establish the duality between complex Archimedean order unit spaces and complex base norm spaces, as well as the corresponding duality between their noncommutative counterparts. Additional topics include an exploration of natural connections with various notions of quantum convexity and regularity of noncommutative convex sets, and an analysis of how these concepts interact with complexification. We also define, as in the classical case, a class that contains and generates the noncommutative base norm spaces, but is defined by fewer axioms. We show how this may be applied to provide new and interesting examples of noncommutative base norm spaces.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$. We test Aaronson's conjecture that $|\perm(X)|^2$ is asymptotically lognormal for Gaussian~$X$: it is plausible for the complex Ginibre and GOE ensembles, but appears to fail for GUE and real Ginibre, where the $\alpha$-stable tails prevent convergence. Anti-concentration, however, holds for all Gaussian ensembles and is more robust than for Haar unitaries.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. We also study the geodesic forom the identity to the DFT matrix.</description>

      <title>A QFT information protocol for charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.</description>
