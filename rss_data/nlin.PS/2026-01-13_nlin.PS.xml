      <title>Coherent Structures and Travelling Waves in Spatial Replicators from a Biased Volterra Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Volterra lattice is a well-known integrable family that is also a special class of replicator dynamics and whose members can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the directed cycle graphs. In this paper, we study a variation of the Volterra lattice by introducing a bias term in the replicator interaction matrix. The resulting system can still be put into one-to-one correspondence with the directed cycles, and the dynamics offer one generalisation of the classic rock-paper-scissors evolutionary game. We study the resulting spatial dynamics of this family, showing that travelling wave solutions are present in those dynamics corresponding to the directed 5- and 6-cycles, but not the 4-cycle. Instead, the 4-cycle exhibits a set of stationary solutions that we call `frozen waves' that are similar to but distinct from Turing patterns. This type of solution is also found in the dynamics generated from the directed 6- and 8-cycles. We discuss how these stationary solutions can represent naturally emergent ecological niches in these systems, and offer generalizing conjectures for the existence of both travelling wave solutions and frozen wave solutions in this family of dynamics as a potential program of future investigation.</description>

      <title>Origin of Frequency Clusters and Robust Triplet Locking in the Kuramoto Model with Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of frequency clusters - states where multiple groups of oscillators with distinct mean frequencies coexist. We use the Kuramoto model with inertia, where identical oscillators are globally coupled. First, we study the creation of two frequency clusters in the thermodynamic limit. Via numerical bifurcation analysis, we confirm that two frequency clusters are created by homoclinic bifurcations. Both clusters can lose their phase-synchrony in transcritical or period-doubling bifurcations. Furthermore, we investigate the creation of three frequency clusters in a system of seven oscillators. Here, the frequency clusters are destabilized by a longitudinal and a transversal period-doubling bifurcation, and the frequency clusters are also created by homoclinic bifurcations. We find that the emergence of three or more frequency clusters via a homoclinic bifurcation implies the creation of a triplet locked state, where the frequency differences exhibit a rational relation. Besides the creation of frequency clusters via a homoclinic bifurcation, we state that Hopf bifurcations cannot create frequency clusters in phase oscillators, and frequency clusters can only be created by global bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the time scales and information flow associated with multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system. This is done through a greedy optimization algorithm which finds the maximum conditional-mutual information across lagged embeddings of time series localized by wavenumber. For our chosen weakly turbulent system, the algorithm finds asymmetries in the information flow across wavenumbers, reflecting what are typically described as forward and inverse cascades. However, our approach goes beyond typical heuristic arguments and provides quantitative insight into the intricate multi-wave mixing dynamics necessary to maintain the steady statistical state characterizing weak turbulence. Our work then provides a novel, detailed, and fully nonlinear statistical analysis of a weakly turbulent system. The flexibility of our approach points to broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) -- a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>
