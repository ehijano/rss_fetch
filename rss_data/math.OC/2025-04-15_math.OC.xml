      <title>High-order expansion of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks, widely recognised for their role in machine learning, are now transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modelling with classical dynamical systems and enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, the practical applicability of these models remains constrained by the opacity of their learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of these dynamical systems are predominantly restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce Event Transition Tensors, a framework based on high-order differentials that provides a rigorous mathematical description of neural ODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterising uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analysing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method enhances the interpretability and rigour of neural ODEs by expressing their behaviour through explicit mathematical structures. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of \emph{Showcase Showdown} with unlimited spins is investigated as an $n$-players continuous game, and the Nash Equilibrium strategies for the players are obtained. The sequential game with information on the results of the previous players is studied, as well as three variants: no information, possibility of draw, and different modalities of winner payoff.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Tensor Recovery via Theta Nuclear p-Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-rank tensor recovery problem using a relaxation of the nuclear p-norm by theta bodies.
  We provide algebraic descriptions of the norms and compute their Gr\"obner bases.
  Moreover, we develop geometric properties of these bodies.
  Finally, our numerical results suggest that for
  $n\times\cdots\times n$ tensors,
  $m\geq O(n)$ measurements should be sufficient to recover low-rank tensors via theta body relaxation.</description>

      <title>A Linear and Scalable Cutting-Plane Algorithm for Electricity Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a linear cutting-plane pricing algorithm tailored for large-scale electricity markets, addressing nonconvexities arising from the Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow equations. We benchmark our algorithm against a Direct Current (DC) approximation and the Jabr Second-Order Cone (SOC) relaxation under both the Integer Programming and Convex Hull pricing rules. We provide numerical results for a small (617-bus) and three large ($\geq 15,000$-bus) networks. Our algorithm yields price signals very close to the Jabr SOC, with computation times comparable to DC once we allow for warm-starts, including scenarios with line contingencies.</description>

      <title>InterQ: A DQN Framework for Optimal Intermittent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we explore the communication-control co-design of discrete-time stochastic linear systems through reinforcement learning. Specifically, we examine a closed-loop system involving two sequential decision-makers: a scheduler and a controller. The scheduler continuously monitors the system's state but transmits it to the controller intermittently to balance the communication cost and control performance. The controller, in turn, determines the control input based on the intermittently received information. Given the partially nested information structure, we show that the optimal control policy follows a certainty-equivalence form. Subsequently, we analyze the qualitative behavior of the scheduling policy. To develop the optimal scheduling policy, we propose InterQ, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm which uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. Through extensive numerical evaluations, we analyze the scheduling landscape and further compare our approach against two baseline strategies: (a) a multi-period periodic scheduling policy, and (b) an event-triggered policy. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both baselines. The open source implementation can be found at https://github.com/AC-sh/InterQ.</description>

      <title>Cooperation, Competition, and Common Pool Resources in Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have been introduced to study Nash equilibria in very large population of self-interested agents. However, when applied to common pool resource (CPR) games, MFG equilibria lead to the so-called tragedy of the commons (TOTC). Empirical studies have shown that in many situations, TOTC does not materialize which hints at the fact that standard MFG models cannot explain the behavior of agents in CPR games. In this work, we study two models which incorporate a mix of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors, either at the individual level or the population level. After defining these models, we study optimality conditions in the form of forward-backward stochastic differential equations and we prove that the mean field models provide approximate equilibria controls for corresponding finite-agent games. We then show an application to a model of fish stock management, for which the solution can be computed by solving systems of ordinary differential equations, which we prove to have a unique solution. Numerical results illustrate the impact of the level of cooperation at the individual and the population levels on the CPR.</description>

      <title>Krasovski\u{i} Stability Theorem for FDEs in the Extended Sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of the stability of systems' equilibria plays a central role in the study of dynamical systems and control theory. This note establishes an extension of the celebrated Krasovski\u{\i} stability theorem for functional differential equations (FDEs) in the extended sense. Namely, the FDEs hold for $t \geq t_0$ almost everywhere with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The existence and uniqueness of such FDEs were briefly discussed in J.K Hale's classical treatise on FDEs, yet a corresponding stability theorem was not provided. A key step in proving the proposed stability theorem was to utilize an alternative strategy instead of relying on the mean value theorem of differentiable functions. The proposed theorem can be useful in the stability analysis of cybernetic systems, which are often subject to noise and glitches that have a countably infinite number of jumps. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed theorem, we provide examples of linear systems with time-varying delays in which the FDEs cannot be defined in the conventional sense.</description>

      <title>Exact Controllability for a Refined Stochastic Hyperbolic Equation with Internal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the internal exact controllability of a refined stochastic hyperbolic equation by deriving a suitable observability inequality via Carleman estimates for the associated backward stochastic hyperbolic equation. In contrast to existing results on boundary exact controllability--which require longer waiting times, we demonstrate that the required waiting time for internal exact controllability in stochastic hyperbolic equations coincides exactly with that of their deterministic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Bouligand Analysis and Discrete Optimal Control of Total Variation-Based Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate differentiability and subdifferentiability properties of the solution mapping associated with variational inequalities (VI) of the second kind involving the discrete total-variation. Bouligand differentiability of the solution operator is established via a direct quotient analysis applied to a primal-dual reformulation of the VI. By exploiting the structure of the directional derivative and introducing a suitable subspace, we fully characterize the Bouligand subdifferential of the solution mapping. We then derive optimality conditions characterizing Bouligand-stationary and strongly-stationary points for discrete VI-constrained optimal control problems. A trust-region algorithm for solving these control problems is proposed based on the obtained characterizations, and a numerical experiment is presented to illustrate the main properties of both the solution and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient-Enhanced Bayesian Optimizer with Comparisons to Quasi-Newton Optimizers for Unconstrained Local Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic surrogates used by Bayesian optimizers make them popular methods when function evaluations are noisy or expensive to evaluate. While Bayesian optimizers are traditionally used for global optimization, their benefits are also valuable for local optimization. In this paper, a framework for gradient-enhanced unconstrained local Bayesian optimization is presented. It involves selecting a subset of the evaluation points to construct the surrogate and using a probabilistic trust region for the minimization of the acquisition function. The Bayesian optimizer is compared to quasi-Newton optimizers from MATLAB and SciPy for unimodal problems with 2 to 40 dimensions. The Bayesian optimizer converges the optimality as deeply as the quasi-Newton optimizer and often does so using significantly fewer function evaluations. For the minimization of the 40-dimensional Rosenbrock function for example, the Bayesian optimizer requires half as many function evaluations as the quasi-Newton optimizers to reduce the optimality by 10 orders of magnitude. For test cases with noisy gradients, the probabilistic surrogate of the Bayesian optimizer enables it to converge the optimality several additional orders of magnitude relative to the quasi-Newton optimizers. The final test case involves the chaotic Lorenz 63 model and inaccurate gradients. For this problem, the Bayesian optimizer achieves a lower final objective evaluation than the SciPy quasi-Newton optimizer for all initial starting solutions. The results demonstrate that a Bayesian optimizer can be competitive with quasi-Newton optimizers when accurate gradients are available, and significantly outperforms them when the gradients are innacurate.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Mean Field Stackelberg Games: Open-loop and Feedback Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates open-loop and feedback solutions of linear quadratic mean field (MF) games with a leader and a large number of followers. The leader first gives its strategy and then all the followers cooperate to optimize the social cost as the sum of their costs. By variational analysis with MF approximations, we obtain a set of open-loop controls of players in terms of solutions to MF forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), which is further shown be to an asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium. By applying the matrix maximum principle, a set of decentralized feedback strategies is constructed for all the players. For open-loop and feedback solutions, the corresponding optimal costs of all players are explicitly given by virtue of the solutions to two Riccati equations, respectively. The performances of two solutions are compared by the numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Bregman Linearized Augmented Lagrangian Method for Nonconvex Constrained Stochastic Zeroth-order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonconvex constrained stochastic zeroth-order optimization problems, for which we have access to exact information of constraints and noisy function values of the objective. We propose a Bregman linearized augmented Lagrangian method that utilizes stochastic zeroth-order gradient estimators combined with a variance reduction technique. We analyze its oracle complexity, in terms of the total number of stochastic function value evaluations required to achieve an \(\epsilon\)-KKT point in \(\ell_p\)-norm metrics with \(p \ge 2\), where \(p\) is a parameter associated with the selected Bregman distance. In particular, starting from a near-feasible initial point and using Rademacher smoothing, the oracle complexity is in order \(O(p d^{2/p} \epsilon^{-3})\) for \(p \in [2, 2 \ln d]\), and \(O(\ln d \cdot \epsilon^{-3})\) for \(p &gt; 2 \ln d\), where \(d\) denotes the problem dimension. Those results show that the complexity of the proposed method can achieve a dimensional dependency lower than \(O(d)\) without requiring additional assumptions, provided that a Bregman distance is chosen properly. This offers a significant improvement in the high-dimensional setting over existing work, and matches the lowest complexity order with respect to the tolerance \(\epsilon\) reported in the literature. Numerical experiments on constrained Lasso and black-box adversarial attack problems highlight the promising performances of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Theoretic Framework for the Optimal Control Problem of Nonlinear Caputo Fractional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal control problem for a class of nonlinear fractional systems involving Caputo derivatives and nonlocal initial conditions. The system is reformulated as an abstract Hammerstein-type operator equation, enabling the application of operator-theoretic techniques. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the existence of mild solutions and optimal control-state pairs. The analysis covers both convex and non-convex scenarios through various sets of assumptions on the involved operators. An optimality system is derived for quadratic cost functionals using the G\^ateaux derivative, and the connection with Pontryagin-type minimum principles is discussed. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Dispatch of Multi-Energy Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies adaptive distributionally robust dispatch (DRD) of the multi-energy microgrid under supply and demand uncertainties. A Wasserstein ambiguity set is constructed to support data-driven decision-making. By fully leveraging the special structure of worst-case expectation from the primal perspective, a novel and high-efficient decomposition algorithm under the framework of column-and-constraint generation is customized and developed to address the computational burden. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our DRD approach, and shed light on the interrelationship of it with the traditional dispatch approaches through stochastic programming and robust optimization schemes. Also, comparisons with popular algorithms in the literature for two-stage distributionally robust optimization verify the powerful capacity of our algorithm in computing the DRD problem.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Over-Parameterized Nonconvex Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical instances of nonconvex matrix factorization, the rank of the true solution $r^{\star}$ is often unknown, so the rank $r$ of the model can be overspecified as $r&gt;r^{\star}$. This over-parameterized regime of matrix factorization significantly slows down the convergence of local search algorithms, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r&gt;r^{\star}$. We propose an inexpensive preconditioner for the matrix sensing variant of nonconvex matrix factorization that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear, even in the over-parameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the ground truth. Classical gradient descent in a neighborhood of the solution slows down due to the need for the model matrix factor to become singular. Our key result is that this singularity can be corrected by $\ell_{2}$ regularization with a specific range of values for the damping parameter. In fact, a good damping parameter can be inexpensively estimated from the current iterate. The resulting algorithm, which we call preconditioned gradient descent or PrecGD, is stable under noise, and converges linearly to an information theoretically optimal error bound. Our numerical experiments find that PrecGD works equally well in restoring the linear convergence of other variants of nonconvex matrix factorization in the over-parameterized regime.</description>

      <title>Level-set topology optimisation with unfitted finite elements and automatic shape differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop automatic shape differentiation techniques for unfitted discretisations and link these to recent advances in shape calculus for unfitted methods. We extend existing analytic shape calculus results to the case where the domain boundary intersects with the boundary of the background domain. We further show that we can recover these analytic derivatives to machine precision regardless of the mesh size using the developed automatic shape differentiation techniques. In addition, we show that we can also recover the symmetric shape Hessian. We implement these techniques for both serial and distributed computing frameworks in the Julia package GridapTopOpt and the wider Gridap ecosystem. As part of this implementation we propose a novel graph-based approach for isolated volume detection. We demonstrate the applicability of the unfitted automatic shape differentiation framework and our implementation by considering the three-dimensional minimum compliance topology optimisation of a linear elastic wheel and of a linear elastic structure in a fluid-structure interaction problem with Stokes flow. The implementation is general and allows GridapTopOpt to solve a wide range of problems without analytic calculation of shape derivatives and avoiding issues that arise when material properties are smoothed at the domain boundary. The software is open source and available at https://github.com/zjwegert/GridapTopOpt.jl.</description>

      <title>Score Matching Diffusion Based Feedback Control and Planning of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel control-theoretic framework that leverages principles from generative modeling -- specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) -- to stabilize control-affine systems with nonholonomic constraints. Unlike traditional stochastic approaches, which rely on noise-driven dynamics in both forward and reverse processes, our method crucially eliminates the need for noise in the reverse phase, making it particularly relevant for control applications. We introduce two formulations: one where noise perturbs all state dimensions during the forward phase while the control system enforces time reversal deterministically, and another where noise is restricted to the control channels, embedding system constraints directly into the forward process.
  For controllable nonlinear drift-free systems, we prove that deterministic feedback laws can exactly reverse the forward process, ensuring that the system's probability density evolves correctly without requiring artificial diffusion in the reverse phase. Furthermore, for linear time-invariant systems, we establish a time-reversal result under the second formulation. By eliminating noise in the backward process, our approach provides a more practical alternative to machine learning-based denoising methods, which are unsuitable for control applications due to the presence of stochasticity. We validate our results through numerical simulations on benchmark systems, including a unicycle model in a domain with obstacles, a driftless five-dimensional system, and a four-dimensional linear system, demonstrating the potential for applying diffusion-inspired techniques in linear, nonlinear, and settings with state space constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Non-Asymptotic Rates of Value Iteration for Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is an extensive body of research on the analysis of Value Iteration (VI) for discounted cumulative-reward MDPs, prior work on analyzing VI for (undiscounted) average-reward MDPs has been limited, and most prior results focus on asymptotic rates in terms of Bellman error. In this work, we conduct refined non-asymptotic analyses of average-reward MDPs, obtaining a collection of convergence results that advance our understanding of the setup. Among our new results, most notable are the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$-rates of Anchored Value Iteration on the Bellman error under the multichain setup and the span-based complexity lower bound that matches the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ upper bound up to a constant factor of $8$ in the weakly communicating and unichain setups</description>

      <title>Tight Semidefinite Relaxations for Verifying Robustness of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For verifying the safety of neural networks (NNs), Fazlyab et al. (2019) introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach called DeepSDP. This formulation can be viewed as the dual of the SDP relaxation for a problem formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). While SDP relaxations of QCQPs generally provide approximate solutions with some gaps, this work focuses on tight SDP relaxations that provide exact solutions to the QCQP for single-layer NNs. Specifically, we analyze tightness conditions in three cases: (i) NNs with a single neuron, (ii) single-layer NNs with an ellipsoidal input set, and (iii) single-layer NNs with a rectangular input set. For NNs with a single neuron, we propose a condition that ensures the SDP admits a rank-1 solution to DeepSDP by transforming the QCQP into an equivalent two-stage problem leads to a solution collinear with a predetermined vector. For single-layer NNs with an ellipsoidal input set, the collinearity of solutions is proved via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition in the two-stage problem. In case of single-layer NNs with a rectangular input set, we demonstrate that the tightness of DeepSDP can be reduced to the single-neuron NNs, case (i), if the weight matrix is a diagonal matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards Weaker Variance Assumptions for Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a classical assumption for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms where the squared norm of the stochastic subgradient (or the variance for smooth problems) is allowed to grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable. We contextualize this assumption in view of its inception in the 1960s, its seemingly independent appearance in the recent literature, its relationship to weakest-known variance assumptions for analyzing stochastic gradient algorithms, and its relevance in deterministic problems for non-Lipschitz nonsmooth convex optimization. We build on and extend a connection recently made between this assumption and the Halpern iteration. For convex nonsmooth, and potentially stochastic, optimization, we analyze horizon-free, anytime algorithms with last-iterate rates. For problems beyond simple constrained optimization, such as convex problems with functional constraints or regularized convex-concave min-max problems, we obtain rates for optimality measures that do not require boundedness of the feasible set.</description>

      <title>Exact Parameter Identification in PET Pharmacokinetic Modeling: Extension to the Reversible Two Tissue Compartment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of recovering tracer kinetic parameters from multi-region measurement data in quantitative PET imaging using the reversible two tissue compartment model. Its main result is an extension of our previous work on the irreversible two tissue compartment model. In analogy to our previous work, we show that also in the (practically highly relevant) reversible case, most tracer kinetic parameters can be uniquely identified from standard PET measurements (without additional full blood sample analysis that is usually performed in practice) and under reasonable assumptions. In addition, unique identifiability of all parameters is shown provided that additional measurements from the (uncorrected) total arterial blood tracer concentration (which can be obtained from standard PET measurements or from a simple blood sample analysis) are available.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient Tracking in Autonomous Vehicles: A Distributionally Robust Input and State Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for the distributionally robust input and state estimation (DRISE) for autonomous vehicles operating under model uncertainties and measurement outliers. The proposed framework improves the input and state estimation (ISE) approach by integrating distributional robustness, enhancing the estimator's resilience and robustness to adversarial inputs and unmodeled dynamics. Moment-based ambiguity sets capture probabilistic uncertainties in both system dynamics and measurement noise, offering analytical tractability and efficiently handling uncertainties in mean and covariance. In particular, the proposed framework minimizes the worst-case estimation error, ensuring robustness against deviations from nominal distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations conducted in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, demonstrating improved performance in state estimation accuracy and robustness in dynamic and uncertain environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aims to decrease gas loss and enhance system reliability during gas pipeline accidents. A computational scheme has been developed that can enable the elimination of gas leakage through the modeling and management of parallel gas pipeline systems. The dynamic state of processes for the supply of modern automatic equipment to gas pipelines and the use of an efficient automated control system have been extensively studied. The analytical determination of the optimal transition time has been widely applied to ensure the most favorable operating conditions for the system. Methods for calculating complex transient processes in main gas pipelines, from a non-stationary regime to a stationary regime, have been developed, particularly at the moment of gas flow ingress. A comparison of mathematical expressions for calculating transient processes in complex main gas pipelines has been conducted through theoretical sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05279v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a manifestly covariant formulation of the gradient descent method, ensuring consistency across arbitrary coordinate systems and general curved trainable spaces. The optimization dynamics is defined using a covariant force vector and a covariant metric tensor, both computed from the first and second statistical moments of the gradients. These moments are estimated through time-averaging with an exponential weight function, which preserves linear computational complexity. We show that commonly used optimization methods such as RMSProp, Adam and AdaBelief correspond to special limits of the covariant gradient descent (CGD) and demonstrate how these methods can be further generalized and improved.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Topic Analysis in Academic Journals using Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, academic topic identification and topic evolution analysis are crucial for enhancing AI's understanding capabilities. Dynamic topic analysis provides a powerful approach to capturing and understanding the temporal evolution of topics in large-scale datasets. This paper presents a two-stage dynamic topic analysis framework that incorporates convex optimization to improve topic consistency, sparsity, and interpretability. In Stage 1, a two-layer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model is employed to extract annual topics and identify key terms. In Stage 2, a convex optimization algorithm refines the dynamic topic structure using the convex NMF (cNMF) model, further enhancing topic integration and stability. Applying the proposed method to IEEE journal abstracts from 2004 to 2022 effectively identifies and quantifies emerging research topics, such as COVID-19 and digital twins. By optimizing sparsity differences in the clustering feature space between traditional and emerging research topics, the framework provides deeper insights into topic evolution and ranking analysis. Moreover, the NMF-cNMF model demonstrates superior stability in topic consistency. At sparsity levels of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9, the proposed approach improves topic ranking stability by 24.51%, 56.60%, and 36.93%, respectively. The source code (to be open after publication) is available at https://github.com/meetyangyang/CDNMF.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, for the first time, a CP model for s-batching with minimum batch size. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the CP model with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP model to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and its ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.</description>

Abstract: With rapid technological progress reshaping the financial industry, quantum technology plays a critical role in advancing risk management, asset allocation, and financial strategies. Realizing its full potential requires overcoming challenges like quantum hardware limits, algorithmic stability, and implementation barriers. This research explores integrating quantum annealing with portfolio optimization, highlighting quantum methods' ability to enhance investment strategy efficiency and speed. Using hybrid quantum-classical models, the study shows combined approaches effectively handle complex optimization better than classical methods. Empirical results demonstrate a portfolio increase of 200,000 Indian Rupees over the benchmark. Additionally, using rebalancing leads to a portfolio that also surpasses the benchmark value.</description>

      <title>Role of Intra-specific Competition and Additional Food on Prey-Predator Systems exhibiting Holling Type-IV Functional Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the study on the impact of competition on additional food provided prey-predator systems have gained significant attention from researchers in the field of mathematical biology. In this study, we consider an additional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-IV functional response and the intra-specific competition among predators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the proposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and further explore the codimension-$1$ and $2$ bifurcations with respect to the additional food and competition. We further study the global dynamics of the system and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do the time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of additional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable in the control system. Making use of the Pontraygin maximum principle, we characterize the optimal quality of additional food and optimal quantity of additional food. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control studies have the potential to be applied to a variety of problems in pest management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the algorithms of Robinson, Smyth, and McKee--Smyth to enumerate all real-rooted integer polynomials of a fixed degree, where the first few (at least three) leading coefficients are specified. Additionally, we introduce new linear programming algorithms to enumerate all feasible interlacing polynomials of a given polynomial that comes from a certain family of real-rooted integer polynomials. These algorithms are further specialised for the study of real equiangular lines, incorporating additional number-theoretic constraints to restrict the enumeration. Our improvements significantly enhance the efficiency of the methods presented in previous work by the authors.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Generative Modeling via Parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generative modeling framework based on a discretized parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, which emerges as a continuous limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm commonly used in optimal transport. Our method performs iterative refinement in the space of Brenier maps using a mirror gradient descent step. We establish theoretical guarantees for generative modeling through the lens of no-regret analysis, demonstrating that the iterates converge to the optimal Brenier map under a variety of step-size schedules. As a technical contribution, we derive a new Evolution Variational Inequality tailored to the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere PDE, connecting geometry, transportation cost, and regret. Our framework accommodates non-log-concave target distributions, constructs an optimal sampling process via the Brenier map, and integrates favorable learning techniques from generative adversarial networks and score-based diffusion models. As direct applications, we illustrate how our theory paves new pathways for generative modeling and variational inference.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how asymmetric information affects the equilibrium dynamics in a setting where a large number of players interacts. Motivated by the analysis of the mechanism of equilibrium price formation, we consider the mean-field limit of a model with two subpopulations of asymmetrically informed players. One subpopulation observes a stochastic factor that remains inaccessible to the other. We derive an equation for the mean-field equilibrium and prove the existence of solutions in probabilistic weak sense. We rely on a discretization of the trajectories and on weak convergence arguments. We also study the conditions under which a mean-field equilibrium provides an approximation of the equilibrium price for an economy populated by finitely many players. Finally, we illustrate how, in the case of a single informed agent, her strategy can be characterized in terms of the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Quadratic Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on deriving quantitative approximation error bounds for neural ordinary differential equations having at most quadratic nonlinearities in the dynamics. The simple dynamics of this model form demonstrates how expressivity can be derived primarily from iteratively composing many basic elementary operations, versus from the complexity of those elementary operations themselves. Like the analog differential analyzer and universal polynomial DAEs, the expressivity is derived instead primarily from the "depth" of the model. These results contribute to our understanding of what depth specifically imparts to the capabilities of deep learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Kuramoto Model: from Many-Particle Liouville Equation to Diffusive Mean-Field Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the mean-field optimal control problem of a swarm of Kuramoto oscillators. The controls exploit the self-synchronization property of the oscillators to achieve target density and target phase coherence. In the limit of an infinite number of oscillators the collective dynamics of the agents' density is described by a diffusive mean-field model in the form of a non-local PDE, where the non-locality arises from the synchronization mechanism. We prove the existence of the optimal control of the mean-field model by using $\Gamma$-convergence strategy of the cost functional corresponding to the Liouville equation on the particle level. In the discussion of propagation of chaos for fixed control functions we complete the relative entropy estimate by using large deviation estimate given by \cite{MR3858403}.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Pattern Mining and Optimization for Load Consolidation in Freight Transportation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freight consolidation has significant potential to reduce transportation costs and mitigate congestion and pollution. An effective load consolidation plan relies on carefully chosen consolidation points to ensure alignment with existing transportation management processes, such as driver scheduling, personnel planning, and terminal operations. This complexity represents a significant challenge when searching for optimal consolidation strategies. Traditional optimization-based methods provide exact solutions, but their computational complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances and they fail to leverage historical data. Machine learning-based approaches address these issues but often ignore operational constraints, leading to infeasible consolidation plans.
  This work proposes SPOT, an end-to-end approach that integrates the benefits of machine learning (ML) and optimization for load consolidation. The ML component plays a key role in the planning phase by identifying the consolidation points through spatio-temporal clustering and constrained frequent itemset mining, while the optimization selects the most cost-effective feasible consolidation routes for a given operational day. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial load data demonstrate that SPOT significantly reduces travel distance and transportation costs (by about 50% on large terminals) compared to the existing industry-standard load planning strategy and a neighborhood-based heuristic. Moreover, the ML component provides valuable tactical-level insights by identifying frequently recurring consolidation opportunities that guide proactive planning. In addition, SPOT is computationally efficient and can be easily scaled to accommodate large transportation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning-based tracking controller based on Gaussian processes (GP) for collision avoidance of multi-agent systems where the agents evolve in the special Euclidean group in the space SE(3). In particular, we use GPs to estimate certain uncertainties that appear in the dynamics of the agents. The control algorithm is designed to learn and mitigate these uncertainties by using GPs as a learning-based model for the predictions. In particular, the presented approach guarantees that the tracking error remains bounded with high probability. We present some simulation results to show how the control algorithm is implemented.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization With Mixed-categorical Design Variables for Expensive-to-evaluate Aeronautical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims at developing new methodologies to optimize computational costly complex systems (e.g., aeronautical engineering systems). The proposed surrogate-based method (often called Bayesian optimization) uses adaptive sampling to promote a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Our in-house implementation, called SEGOMOE, handles a high number of design variables (continuous, discrete or categorical) and nonlinearities by combining mixtures of experts for the objective and/or the constraints. Additionally, the method handles multi-objective optimization settings, as it allows the construction of accurate Pareto fronts with a minimal number of function evaluations. Different infill criteria have been implemented to handle multiple objectives with or without constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested on practical aeronautical applications within the context of the European Project AGILE 4.0 and demonstrated favorable results. A first example concerns a retrofitting problem where a comparison between two optimizers have been made. A second example introduces hierarchical variables to deal with architecture system in order to design an aircraft family. The third example increases drastically the number of categorical variables as it combines aircraft design, supply chain and manufacturing process. In this article, we show, on three different realistic problems, various aspects of our optimization codes thanks to the diversity of the treated aircraft problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel stochastic multigrid minimization method for ptychographic phase retrieval. In our formulation, the challenging nonconvex and ill-posed inverse problem is recast as the iterative minimization of a quadratic surrogate model that majorizes the original objective function. Our general framework encompasses the Ptychographic Iterative Engine (PIE) family of algorithms. By efficiently solving the surrogate problem using a multigrid method, our approach delivers significant improvements in both convergence speed and reconstruction quality compared with conventional PIE techniques.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and bound the approximation errors as a function of the cost of losing a sale. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment. Under these conditions, we also show that the optimal cost rate approaches infinity, proportional to the square root of the cost of losing a sale.</description>

      <title>Nonnegativity of signomials with Newton simplex over convex sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of signomials whose positive support is the set of vertices of a simplex and which may have multiple negative support points in the simplex. Various groups of authors have provided an exact characterization for the global nonnegativity of a signomial in this class in terms of circuit signomials and that characterization provides a tractable nonnegativity test. We generalize this characterization to the constrained nonnegativity over a convex set $X$. This provides a tractable $X$-nonnegativity test for the class in terms of relative entropy programming and in terms of the support function of $X$. Our proof methods rely on the convex cone of constrained SAGE signomials (sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials) and the duality theory of this cone.</description>

      <title>An energy optimization method based on mixed-integer model and variational quantum computing algorithm for faster IMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers superior dose conformity with reduced exposure to surrounding healthy tissues compared to conventional photon therapy. Improving IMPT delivery efficiency reduces motion-related uncertainties, enhances plan robustness, and benefits breath-hold techniques by shortening treatment time. Among various factors, energy switching time plays a critical role, making energy layer optimization (ELO) essential. This work develops an energy layer optimization method based on mixed integer model and variational quantum computing algorithm to enhance the efficiency of IMPT. The energy layer optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, where continuous variables optimize the dose distribution and binary variables indicate energy layer selection. To solve it, iterative convex relaxation decouples the dose-volume constraints, followed by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to separate mixed-variable optimization and the minimum monitor unit (MMU) constraint. The resulting beam intensity subproblem, subject to MMU, either admits a closed-form solution or is efficiently solvable via conjugate gradient. The binary subproblem is cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable using variational quantum computing algorithms. With nearly the same plan quality, the proposed method noticeable reduces the number of the used energies. For example, compared to conventional IMPT, QC can reduce the number of energy layers from 61 to 35 in HN case, from 56 to 35 in lung case, and from 59 to 32 to abdomen case. The reduced number of energies also results in fewer delivery time, e.g., the delivery time is reduced from 100.6, 232.0, 185.3 seconds to 90.7, 215.4, 154.0 seconds, respectively.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores a limit avoidance approach in the case of input (modulation) and output (current) constraints with the aim of enhancing system availability of AC drives. Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range of reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation magnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization problem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Fair Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10389v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online selection problems frequently arise in applications such as crowdsourcing and employee recruitment. Existing research typically focuses on candidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require contributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated by the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair online selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to foster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for this problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for crowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill temporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario, recruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing capacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a long-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$ dimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass a competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any achievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this end, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance with the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging marginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a competitive ratio of $1/(4\sqrt{d} \lceil \log_2 d \rceil)$. For the unknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of $\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions. In both bilevel hierarchical policies, the higher level determines ex-ante selection probabilities and then informs the lower level's randomized selection that ensures no loss in efficiency. Both policies prioritize core diversity and then adjust for underrepresented dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bounds as blueprints: towards optimal and accelerated photonic inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our ability to structure materials at the nanoscale has, and continues to, enable key advances in optical control. In pursuit of optimal photonic designs, substantial progress has been made on two complementary fronts: bottom-up structural optimizations (inverse design) discover complex high-performing structures but offer no guarantees of optimality; top-down field optimizations (convex relaxations) reveal fundamental performance limits but offer no guarantees that structures meeting the limits exist. We bridge the gap between these two parallel paradigms by introducing a ``verlan'' initialization method that exploits the encoded local and global wave information in duality-based convex relaxations to guide inverse design towards better-performing structures. We illustrate this technique via the challenging problem of Purcell enhancement, maximizing the power extracted from a small emitter in the vicinity of a photonic structure, where ill-conditioning and the presence of competing local maxima lead to sub-optimal designs for adjoint optimization. Structures discovered by our verlan method outperform standard (random) initializations by close to an order of magnitude and approach fundamental performance limits within a factor of two, highlighting the possibility of accessing significant untapped performance improvements.</description>

Abstract: We consider policy gradient methods for stochastic optimal control problem in continuous time. In particular, we analyze the gradient flow for the control, viewed as a continuous time limit of the policy gradient method. We prove the global convergence of the gradient flow and establish a convergence rate under some regularity assumptions. The main novelty in the analysis is the notion of local optimal control function, which is introduced to characterize the local optimality of the iterate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies generalized semi-infinite programs (GSIPs) given by polynomials. We propose a hierarchy of polynomial optimization relaxations to solve them. They are based on Lagrange multiplier expressions and polynomial extensions. Moment-SOS relaxations are applied to solve the polynomial optimization. The convergence of this hierarchy is shown under certain conditions. In particular, the classical semi-infinite programs (SIPs) can be solved as a special case of GSIPs. We also study GSIPs that have convex infinity constraints and show that they can be solved exactly by a single polynomial optimization relaxation.

      <title>Convergence of the Stochastic Heavy Ball Method With Approximate Gradients and/or Block Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the convergence of the stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) algorithm under more general conditions than in the current literature. Specifically, (i) The stochastic gradient is permitted to be biased, and also, to have conditional variance that grows over time (or iteration number). This feature is essential when applying SHB with zeroth-order methods, which use only two function evaluations to approximate the gradient. In contrast, all existing papers assume that the stochastic gradient is unbiased and/or has bounded conditional variance. (ii) The step sizes are permitted to be random, which is essential when applying SHB with block updating. The sufficient conditions for convergence are stochastic analogs of the well-known Robbins-Monro conditions. This is in contrast to existing papers where more restrictive conditions are imposed on the step size sequence. (iii) Our analysis embraces not only convex functions, but also more general functions that satisfy the PL (Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz) and KL (Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz) conditions. (iv) If the stochastic gradient is unbiased and has bounded variance, and the objective function satisfies (PL), then the iterations of SHB match the known best rates for convex functions. (v) We establish the almost-sure convergence of the iterations, as opposed to convergence in the mean or convergence in probability, which is the case in much of the literature. (vi) Each of the above convergence results continue to hold if full-coordinate updating is replaced by any one of three widely-used updating methods. In addition, numerical computations are carried out to illustrate the above points.</description>

      <title>Maximum Principle of Stochastic Optimal Control Problems with Model Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10454v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the maximum principle of stochastic optimal control problems, where the coefficients of the state equation and the cost functional are uncertain, and the system is generally under Markovian regime switching. Firstly, the $ L^\beta$-solutions of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with regime switching are given. Secondly, we obtain the variational inequality by making use of the continuity of solutions to variational equations with respect to the uncertainty parameter $\theta$. Thirdly, utilizing the linearization and weak convergence techniques, we prove the necessary stochastic maximum principle and provide sufficient conditions for the stochastic optimal control. Finally, as an application, a risk-minimizing portfolio selection problem is studied.</description>

      <title>Newton-CG methods for nonconvex unconstrained optimization with H\"older continuous Hessian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem minimizing a twice differentiable objective function with H\"older continuous Hessian. Specifically, we first propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) method for finding an approximate first- and second-order stationary point of this problem, assuming the associated the H\"older parameters are explicitly known. Then we develop a parameter-free Newton-CG method without requiring any prior knowledge of these parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first parameter-free second-order method achieving the best-known iteration and operation complexity for finding an approximate first- and second-order stationary point of this problem. Finally, we present preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the superior practical performance of our parameter-free Newton-CG method over a well-known regularized Newton method.</description>

      <title>Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03692v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Safety-Critical Systems with Probabilistic Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We often rely on probabilistic measures--e.g. event probability or expected time--to characterize systems safety. However, determining these quantities for extremely low-probability events is generally challenging, as standard safety methods usually struggle due to conservativeness, high-dimension scalability, tractability or numerical limitations. We address these issues by leveraging rigorous approximations grounded in the principles of Large Deviations theory. By assuming deterministic initial conditions, Large Deviations identifies a single dominant path as the most significant contributor to the rare-event probability: the instanton. We extend this result to incorporate stochastic uncertainty in the initial states, which is a common assumption in many applications. To that end, we determine an expression for the probability density of the initial states, conditioned on the instanton--the most dominant path hitting the unsafe region--being observed. This expression gives access to the most probable initial conditions, as well as the most probable hitting time and path deviations, leading to an unsafe rare event. We demonstrate its effectiveness by solving a high-dimensional and non-linear problem: a space collision.</description>

      <title>A Novel Privacy Enhancement Scheme with Dynamic Quantization for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely regarded as a promising paradigm for privacy preservation of raw data in machine learning. Although, the data privacy in FL is locally protected to some extent, it is still a desideratum to enhance privacy and alleviate communication overhead caused by repetitively transmitting model parameters. Typically, these challenges are addressed separately, or jointly via a unified scheme that consists of noise-injected privacy mechanism and communication compression, which may lead to model corruption due to the introduced composite noise. In this work, we propose a novel model-splitting privacy-preserving FL (MSP-FL) scheme to achieve private FL with precise accuracy guarantee. Based upon MSP-FL, we further propose a model-splitting privacy-preserving FL with dynamic quantization (MSPDQ-FL) to mitigate the communication overhead, which incorporates a shrinking quantization interval to reduce the quantization error. We provide privacy and convergence analysis for both MSP-FL and MSPDQ-FL under non-i.i.d. dataset, partial clients participation and finite quantization level. Numerical results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Consensus in Multiagent Systems under communication failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure.
  We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>Coreset-Based Task Selection for Sample-Efficient Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study task selection to enhance sample efficiency in model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning (MAML-RL). Traditional meta-RL typically assumes that all available tasks are equally important, which can lead to task redundancy when they share significant similarities. To address this, we propose a coreset-based task selection approach that selects a weighted subset of tasks based on how diverse they are in gradient space, prioritizing the most informative and diverse tasks. Such task selection reduces the number of samples needed to find an $\epsilon$-close stationary solution by a factor of O(1/$\epsilon$). Consequently, it guarantees a faster adaptation to unseen tasks while focusing training on the most relevant tasks. As a case study, we incorporate task selection to MAML-LQR (Toso et al., 2024b), and prove a sample complexity reduction proportional to O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) when the task specific cost also satisfy gradient dominance. Our theoretical guarantees underscore task selection as a key component for scalable and sample-efficient meta-RL. We numerically validate this trend across multiple RL benchmark problems, illustrating the benefits of task selection beyond the LQR baseline.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models with Uncertain Probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust optimization for a rich class of risk measures with ambiguity sets defined by $\phi$-divergences. The risk measures are allowed to be non-linear in probabilities, are represented by Choquet integrals possibly induced by a probability weighting function, and encompass many well-known examples. Optimization for this class of risk measures is challenging due to their rank-dependent nature. We show that for various shapes of probability weighting functions, including concave, convex and inverse $S$-shaped, the robust optimization problem can be reformulated into a rank-independent problem. In the case of a concave probability weighting function, the problem can be reformulated further into a convex optimization problem that admits explicit conic representability for a collection of canonical examples. While the number of constraints in general scales exponentially with the dimension of the state space, we circumvent this dimensionality curse and develop two types of algorithms. They yield tight upper and lower bounds on the exact optimal value and are formally shown to converge asymptotically. This is illustrated numerically in a robust newsvendor problem and a robust portfolio choice problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a constrained Markov decision process under uncertain transition probabilities, with the uncertainty modeled as deviations from observed transition probabilities. We construct the uncertainty set associated with the deviations using polyhedral and second-order cone constraints and employ a robust optimization framework. We demonstrate that each inner optimization problem of the robust model can be equivalently transformed into a second-order cone programming problem. Using strong duality arguments, we show that the resulting robust problem can be equivalently reformulated into a second-order cone programming problem with bilinear constraints. In the numerical experiments, we study a machine replacement problem and explore potential sources of uncertainty in the transition probabilities. We examine how the optimal values and solutions differ as we vary the feasible region of the uncertainty set, considering only polyhedral constraints and a combination of polyhedral and second-order cone constraints. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of the number of states, the discount factor, and variations in the feasible region of the uncertainty set on the optimal values.</description>

      <title>Local Linear Convergence of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Semidefinite Programming under Strict Complementarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the local linear convergence properties of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) when applied to Semidefinite Programming (SDP). A longstanding belief suggests that ADMM is only capable of solving SDPs to moderate accuracy, primarily due to its sublinear worst-case complexity and empirical observations of slow convergence. We challenge this notion by introducing a new sufficient condition for local linear convergence: as long as the converged primal-dual optimal solutions satisfy strict complementarity, ADMM attains local linear convergence, independent of nondegeneracy conditions. Our proof is based on a direct local linearization of the ADMM operator and a refined error bound for the projection onto the positive semidefinite cone, improving previous bounds and revealing the anisotropic nature of projection residuals. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the significance of our theoretical results, demonstrating that ADMM achieves local linear convergence and computes high-accuracy solutions in a variety of SDP instances, including those cases where nondegeneracy fails. Furthermore, we identify where ADMM struggles, linking these difficulties with near violations of strict complementarity-a phenomenon that parallels recent findings in linear programming.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: A new approach to regret analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on numerically solving a shape identification problem related to advection-diffusion processes with space-dependent coefficients using shape optimization techniques. Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce weak optimal entropy transport problems that cover both optimal entropy transport problems and weak optimal transport problems introduced by Liero, Mielke, and Savar\'{e} [27]; and Gozlan, Roberto, Samson and Tetali [20], respectively. Under some mild assumptions of entropy functionals, we establish a Kantorovich type duality for our weak optimal entropy transport problem. We also introduce martingale optimal entropy transport problems, and express them in terms of duality, homogeneous marginal perspective functionals and homogeneous constraints.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bernstein inequalities and spectral inequality on thick sets for the Landau operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a spectral inequality for the Landau operator. This means that for all $f$ in the spectral subspace corresponding to energies up to $E$, the $L^2$-integral over suitable $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ can be lower bounded by an explicit constant times the $L^2$-norm of $f$ itself. We identify the class of all measurable sets $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ for which such an inequality can hold, namely so-called thick or relatively dense sets, and deduce an asymptotically optimal expression for the constant in terms of the energy, the magnetic field strength and in terms of parameters determining the thick set $S$. Our proofs rely on so-called magnetic Bernstein inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain the first proof of null-controllability for the magnetic heat equation (with sharp bound on the control cost), and can relax assumptions in existing proofs of Anderson localization in the continuum alloy-type model.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. By the pit of losses paradox identified in previous work, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments tend to reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of "rejecting all proposals without voting" outperforms majority voting. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments. Here, the simple social decision rule of "accepting all proposals without voting" is superior to majority voting. We prove that under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and the antisymmetry of the voting body, the second pit of losses is a mirror image of the pit of losses in hostile environments and explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists whose strategy is supporting all proposals that increase their capital and a group (groups) whose members vote to increase the wealth of their group. According to the main result, the expected capital gain of each agent in the environment whose generator $X$ has mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds by $\mu$ their expected capital gain under generator $-X$. This result extends to location families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. The mentioned result determines the symmetry of the difference between the expected capital gain under the symmetrized majority and that under the "basic" social decision rule that rejects (resp. accepts) all proposals in unfavorable (resp. favorable) environments.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Off-the-grid regularisation for Poisson inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-the-grid regularisation has been extensively employed over the last decade in the context of ill-posed inverse problems formulated in the continuous setting of the space of Radon measures $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$. These approaches enjoy convexity and counteract the discretisation biases as well the numerical instabilities typical of their discrete counterparts. In the framework of sparse reconstruction of discrete point measures (sum of weighted Diracs), a Total Variation regularisation norm in $\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$ is typically combined with an $L^2$ data term modelling additive Gaussian noise. To asses the framework of off-the-grid regularisation in the presence of signal-dependent Poisson noise, we consider in this work a variational model coupling the Total Variation regularisation with a Kullback-Leibler data term under a non-negativity constraint. Analytically, we study the optimality conditions of the composite functional and analyse its dual problem. Then, we consider an homotopy strategy to select an optimal regularisation parameter and use it within a Sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Several numerical experiments on both 1D/2D simulated and real 3D fluorescent microscopy data are reported.</description>

      <title>Evaluating probabilistic and data-driven inference models for fiber-coupled NV-diamond temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</description>

      <title>Towards safe Bayesian optimization with Wiener kernel regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a data-driven strategy for minimizing/maximizing black-box functions based on probabilistic surrogate models. In the presence of safety constraints, the performance of BO crucially relies on tight probabilistic error bounds related to the uncertainty surrounding the surrogate model. For the case of Gaussian Process surrogates and Gaussian measurement noise, we present a novel error bound based on the recently proposed Wiener kernel regression. We prove that under rather mild assumptions, the proposed error bound is tighter than bounds previously documented in the literature, leading to enlarged safety regions. We draw upon a numerical example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed error bound in safe BO.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization for the Evolve-Filter-Relax regularization of convection-dominated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical stabilization techniques are often employed in under-resolved simulations of convection-dominated flows to improve accuracy and mitigate spurious oscillations. Specifically, the evolve--filter--relax (EFR) algorithm is a framework which consists in evolving the solution, applying a filtering step to remove high-frequency noise, and relaxing through a convex combination of filtered and original solutions. The stability and accuracy of the EFR solution strongly depend on two parameters, the filter radius $\delta$ and the relaxation parameter $\chi$. Standard choices for these parameters are usually fixed in time, and related to the full order model setting, i.e., the grid size for $\delta$ and the time step for $\chi$. The key novelties with respect to the standard EFR approach are: (i) time-dependent parameters $\delta(t)$ and $\chi(t)$, and (ii) data-driven adaptive optimization of the parameters in time, considering a fully-resolved simulation as reference. In particular, we propose three different classes of optimized-EFR (Opt-EFR) strategies, aiming to optimize one or both parameters. The new Opt-EFR strategies are tested in the under-resolved simulation of a turbulent flow past a cylinder at $Re=1000$. The Opt-EFR proved to be more accurate than standard approaches by up to 99$\%$, while maintaining a similar computational time. In particular, the key new finding of our analysis is that such accuracy can be obtained only if the optimized objective function includes: (i) a global metric (as the kinetic energy), and (ii) spatial gradients' information.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Society Caused by Collective and Individual Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making societies may vary in their level of cooperation and degree of conservatism, both of which influence their overall performance. Moreover, these factors are not fixed -- they can change based on the decisions agents in the society make in their interests. But can these changes lead to cyclical patterns in societal evolution? To explore this question, we use the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model. In this framework, the level of cooperation can be measured by group size, while the degree of conservatism is determined by the voting threshold. Agents can adopt either individualistic or group-oriented strategies when voting on stochastically generated external proposals. For Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gain (ECG) -- a measure of agents' performance -- can be expressed in standard mathematical functions. Our findings show that in neutral environments, societal evolution with open or democratic groups can follow cyclic patterns. We also find that highly conservative societies or conservative societies with low levels of cooperation can evolve into liberal (less conservative than majoritarian) societies and that mafia groups never let their members go when they want to.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Analytical Formulation of Collision Detection and Rigid Body Dynamics With Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating intelligent robot behavior in contact-rich settings is a research problem where zeroth-order methods currently prevail. A major contributor to the success of such methods is their robustness in the face of non-smooth and discontinuous optimization landscapes that are characteristic of contact interactions, yet zeroth-order methods remain computationally inefficient. It is therefore desirable to develop methods for perception, planning and control in contact-rich settings that can achieve further efficiency by making use of first and second order information (i.e., gradients and Hessians). To facilitate this, we present a joint formulation of collision detection and contact modelling which, compared to existing differentiable simulation approaches, provides the following benefits: i) it results in forward and inverse dynamics that are entirely analytical (i.e. do not require solving optimization or root-finding problems with iterative methods) and smooth (i.e. twice differentiable), ii) it supports arbitrary collision geometries without needing a convex decomposition, and iii) its runtime is independent of the number of contacts. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the validity of the proposed formulation as a "physics for inference" that can facilitate future development of efficient methods to generate intelligent contact-rich behavior.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>
