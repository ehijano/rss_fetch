      <title>The Energy Spectrum of Kaon from Lattice QCD: A Statistical and Theoretical Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the analysis of data related to the two-point function of kaon generated from lattice QCD simulations. Using gauge configurations of twisted-mass fermions, we obtain the correlation functions for six values of momentum for the kaon between 0 and 2GeV (both inclusive), we use statistical techniques such as jackknife resampling to derive the energy of the particle. The lattice results are compared to the continuum dispersion relation for the particle, to assess systematic uncertainties in the lattice data. We establish consistency with theory by comparing our results with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic pressure and novel first-order phase transition in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior and phase diagram of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ in Euclidean spacetime using an effective model. In our approach, the Polyakov loops along the compactified directions are treated as dynamic variables, and the model is calibrated to match lattice simulation results for thermodynamic observables on $\mathbb{T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$. Our analysis reveals a novel first-order phase transition in the deconfined phase that ends at critical points, which appear to belong to the two-dimensional $Z_2$ universality class. This transition is driven by the interplay between the two Polyakov loops, introduced via a cross-term in the Polyakov-loop potential.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Study of the Roughening Transition in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</description>

      <title>Chiral extrapolation of the doubly charmed baryons magnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moments, magnetic form factors, and transition magnetic form factors of doubly charmed baryons are studied within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We regulate the loop integrals using the finite-range regularization. The contributions of vector mesons are taken into account to investigate the dependence of form factors on the transferred momentum. The finite volume and lattice spacing effects are considered to analyze the lattice QCD simulations which can be understood well in our framework.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>
