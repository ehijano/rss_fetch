      <title>Modeling Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Obesity in Italian Regions Via Bayesian Beta Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of obesity rates across Italian regions from 2010 to 2022, aiming to identify spatial and temporal trends and assess potential heterogeneities. We implement a Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model to analyze regional obesity rates, integrating spatial and temporal random effects, alongside gender and various exogenous predictors. The model leverages the Stochastic Search Variable Selection technique to identify significant predictors supported by the data. The analysis reveals both regional heterogeneity and dependence in obesity rates over the study period, emphasizing the importance of considering gender and spatial correlation in explaining its dynamics over time. In fact, the inclusion of structured spatial and temporal random effects captures the complexities of regional variations over time. These random effects, along with gender, emerge as the primary determinants of obesity prevalence across Italian regions, while the role of exogenous covariates is found to be minimal at the regional level. While socioeconomic and lifestyle factors remain fundamental at a micro-level, the findings demonstrate that the integration of spatial and temporal structures is critical for capturing macro-level obesity variations.</description>

      <title>Estimated Phase II Weibull control chart for monitoring times between events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical process control Weibull distribution can be used to model the time between events or failures (TBE) in a process with increasing decreasing or constant failure rates. Specifically it helps in monitoring processes where the time between defect occurrences is of interest providing insight into the process reliability and performance. In this paper we consider the two sided problem of monitoring either an increase or a decrease in the scale parameter of the Weibull distribution with control charts assuming the shape parameter to be fixed. A larger scale parameter indicates that events are more spread out over time suggesting fewer defects while a smaller value may suggest deterioration in the process resulting in a higher number of defects. When the scale parameter is unknown it is estimated from Phase I observations and the plug in control limits are obtained by replacing the parameter by its estimated value from the Phase I observations. Given the well accepted fact that estimated control limits often do not perform as expected, the control limits of the Weibull chart are adjusted to achieve the desired in control (IC) performance using two criteria that are conditional average run length and standard deviation of conditional ARL. A performance study is carried out in order to assess in control and out of control performances of the proposed charts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Carbon Targets on Firms' Carbon Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although goal-setting theory predicts that a challenging and specific goal can improve performance, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of an environmental goal in organizations is mixed. Using a panel data set consisting over 700 global firms across multiple industries, we apply a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) strategy and empirically analyze the effect of having science-based carbon emissions targets (SBTs) on firms' carbon performance. The findings in this study contribute to the debate regarding the necessity of setting SBTs.</description>

      <title>SkipTrack: A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Self-tracked Menstrual Cycle Length and Regularity in Large Mobile Health Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menstrual cycle length and regularity are important vital signs with implications for a variety of acute and chronic health conditions. Large datasets derived from cycle-tracking mobile health apps are being used to investigate the effects of various covariates on menstrual cycle length and regularity. One limitation on these analyses is that recorded cycle lengths can be incorrectly inflated if users skip tracking any cycle related bleeding days in the app. Here we present SkipTrack, a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework for examining baseline and time-varying effects on menstrual cycle length and regularity while accounting for the uncertainty of possible skips in cycle tracking. In simulations we demonstrate the superiority of the SkipTrack model by showing that competing methods which specify cycle skips a priori are more susceptible to issues of estimation bias and overconfidence than the SkipTrack model. Finally, we apply the SkipTrack framework to data from the Apple Women's Healthy Study, a US-based digital cohort (consent provided at study enrollment) to examine patterns of association between age, BMI and race/ethnicity, and menstrual cycle length and regularity.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methods of Expert Elicitation for Treatment Effect or Borrowing Parameters in Standard and Rare Disease Clinical Trials: A Systematic Mapping Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert elicitation is an invaluable tool for gaining insights into the degree of clinical knowledge surrounding parameters of interest when designing, or supplementing trial data when analysing, a clinical trial. Elicitation is considered particularly useful in cases where limited data are available, such as in rare diseases. This study aims to identify methods of expert elicitation and aggregation for treatment effect or borrowing parameters that are used in the design or analysis stages of clinical trials. A comprehensive review of statistical and non-statistical literature was conducted by database searching, and reference list screening of older, relevant literature reviews. The search took place in October 2024 and identified 366 potentially relevant publications. Of these, 126 were selected for full-text review based on review of titles and abstracts, and 41 publications were deemed eligible for inclusion after a full reading. For each included publication, data were extracted on methods of elicitation and aggregation, the types of parameters elicited, the resulting distributions, the number of experts used, and any training provided to experts. Publication characteristics such as contribution type, journal type, and application to the rare disease setting was also noted. A narrative description of the selected publications was produced, detailing 6 unique methods for expert elicitation and 10 unique methods for aggregation. We discuss the most popular methods used across standard and rare disease clinical trials, along with any strengths and limitations. Overall, there is no formal framework for expert elicitation in clinical trials, and more general methods are applied with little consideration into the specific context and trial designs. This review identifies the methodological gaps in current practice, providing a foundation for future development.</description>

      <title>Bayesian weighted discrete-time dynamic models for association football prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, great emphasis has been placed on the prediction of association football. Due to this, several studies have proposed different types of statistical models to predict the outcome of a football match. However, most existing approaches usually assume that the offensive and defensive abilities of teams remain static over time. We introduce a Bayesian dynamic approach for football goal based models that uses period-specific commensurate priors to flexibly weight the evolution of attacking and defensive abilities. Our approach assigns separate, time varying precisions for each ability and period, controlled via spike and slab hyperpriors. This adaptive shrinkage borrows information about teams' strength when past and current performance aligns and allows rapid adjustments when teams experience substantial changes (e.g., transfer windows or coaching changes). We integrate this framework into six standard goal based models evaluating predictive performance using data from the last five seasons of the German Bundesliga, English Premier League, and Spanish La Liga. Compared with the other discrete time dynamic models, our adaptive approach yields better predictive performance. The proposed methodology has also been implemented in the free and open source R package footBayes.</description>

      <title>A Time Series Model for Three Asset Classes used in Financial Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We create a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for annual returns of three asset classes: the USA Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) stock index, the international stock index, and the USA Bank of America investment-grade corporate bond index. Using this, we made an online financial app simulating wealth process. This includes options for regular withdrawals and contributions. Four factors are: S&amp;P volatility and earnings, corporate BAA rate, and long-short Treasury bond spread. Our valuation measure is an improvement of Shiller's cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio. We use classic linear regression models, and make residuals white noise by dividing by annual volatility. We use multivariate kernel density estimation for residuals. We state and prove long-term stability results.</description>

      <title>General Seemingly Unrelated Local Projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for the efficient estimation of impulse responses using Local Projections (LPs) with instrumental variables. It accommodates multiple shocks and instruments, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, and allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that our approach delivers more accurate point and uncertainty estimates than standard methods. To address potential misspecification, we propose an optional robustification step based on power posteriors.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Conversational Interviewing: Effects on Data Quality and User Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standardized surveys scale efficiently but sacrifice depth, while conversational interviews improve response quality at the cost of scalability and consistency. This study bridges the gap between these methods by introducing a framework for AI-assisted conversational interviewing. To evaluate this framework, we conducted a web survey experiment where 1,800 participants were randomly assigned to AI 'chatbots' which use large language models (LLMs) to dynamically probe respondents for elaboration and interactively code open-ended responses to fixed questions developed by human researchers. We assessed the AI chatbot's performance in terms of coding accuracy, response quality, and respondent experience. Our findings reveal that AI chatbots perform moderately well in live coding even without survey-specific fine-tuning, despite slightly inflated false positive errors due to respondent acquiescence bias. Open-ended responses were more detailed and informative, but this came at a slight cost to respondent experience. Our findings highlight the feasibility of using AI methods such as chatbots enhanced by LLMs to enhance open-ended data collection in web surveys.</description>

      <title>Spatial Association Between Near-Misses and Accident Blackspots in Sydney, Australia: A Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional road safety management is inherently reactive, relying on analysis of sparse and lagged historical crash data to identify hazardous locations, or crash blackspots. The proliferation of vehicle telematics presents an opportunity for a paradigm shift towards proactive safety, using high-frequency, high-resolution near-miss data as a leading indicator of crash risk. This paper presents a spatial-statistical framework to systematically analyze the concordance and discordance between official crash records and near-miss events within urban environment. A Getis-Ord statistic is first applied to both reported crashes and near-miss events to identify statistically significant local clusters of each type. Subsequently, Bivariate Local Moran's I assesses spatial relationships between crash counts and High-G event counts, classifying grid cells into distinct profiles: High-High (coincident risk), High-Low and Low-High. Our analysis reveals significant amount of Low-Crash, High-Near-Miss clusters representing high-risk areas that remain unobservable when relying solely on historical crash data. Feature importance analysis is performed using contextual Point of Interest data to identify the different infrastructure factors that characterize difference between spatial clusters. The results provide a data-driven methodology for transport authorities to transition from a reactive to a proactive safety management strategy, allowing targeted interventions before severe crashes occur.</description>

      <title>A Graph Sufficiency Perspective for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations, where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. We explore two theoretical paths under this graph-based view. The first path assumes dense anchor points and shows that asymptotic sufficiency holds in the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. The second path, more aligned with practical architectures, proves exact or approximate sufficiency in finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. This path can ensure the sufficiency property for an infinite number of layers, and provide error bounds on the optimal loss for both regression and classification tasks using standard neural networks. Our framework covers fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid activations, and convolutional neural networks. Overall, this work bridges statistical sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a new statistical understanding of neural networks.</description>
