      <title>Time-dependent convergent close coupling method for molecular ionization in laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a time-dependent multi-configurational numerical technique for calculating ionization by short laser pulses of many-electron molecules. The method is based on the expansion of the wave function of a molecule into the eigenstates of the molecular ion. We classify this method as time-dependent convergent close coupling (TDCCC) because it uses the same symmetry for channel functions as the well-known convergent close coupling (CCC) method.</description>

      <title>Interatomic Interaction Models for Magnetic Materials: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling is a widely employed theoretical method of computational materials science. It has found particular utility in the study of magnetic materials. Initially, magnetic empirical interatomic potentials or spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) served as the primary models for describing interatomic interactions in atomistic simulations of magnetic systems. Furthermore, in recent years, a new class of interatomic potentials known as magnetic machine-learning interatomic potentials (magnetic MLIPs) has emerged. These MLIPs combine the computational efficiency, in terms of CPU time, of empirical potentials with the accuracy of DFT calculations. In this review, our focus lies on providing a comprehensive summary of the interatomic interaction models developed specifically for investigating magnetic materials. We also delve into the various problem classes to which these models can be applied. Finally, we offer insights into the future prospects of interatomic interaction model development for the exploration of magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Probing Wigner time delays with photoelectron interferometry: Anisotropic long-range imprint of the short-range centrifugal potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-photon ionization of Hydrogen-like atoms. We find an approximate expres- sion of the long-range phase based on an asymptotic expansion of the continuum eigenfunctions within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. Combined with commonly used perturbative approaches, the resulting analytic formalism can treat, at the same time, the two-photon propensity rules, the anisotropy in the continuum-continuum photoionization time delay and the soft-photon regime.</description>

      <title>All-fiber, near-infrared, laser system at 780nm for atom cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold neutral atoms are a promising "architecture" for novel and innovative quantum technology applications. These range from quantum sensors for magnetic fields, interferometers for gravimetry measurements, to quantum computing and simulations. Within this technological landscape, reliable laser systems are crucial in order to cool and manipulate atoms efficiently. We present the design, experimental realization and characterization of a relatively simple, compact, and economical laser system for quantum technology applications. It operates at 780 nm in order to work with Rubidium atoms, and it is entirely based on fiber components. This improves its reliability, and makes it less complex and more versatile with respect to a free-space system.
  In order to cut costs, we take advantage of already available commercial fiber devices at 1560 nm: due to their ubiquity in telecom applications they are in fact cheap and standardized. To operate at Rubidium wavelengths the system employs Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) of the 1560 nm infrared radiation: two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm (one for cooling, one for repumping) are combined, amplified in an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), and frequency-doubled in a Periodically-Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal.
  We characterize the amplitude stability of the lasers, their frequency noise, and the SHG efficiency. The measured features (rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s; linewidths well below 1 MHz) make our system a suitable candidate for applications in quantum sensors and atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Interacting Kerr-Newman Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some of the properties of the $G \to 0$ limit of the Kerr-Newman solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. Noting Carter's observation of the near equality between the $g = 2$ gyromagnetic ratio in the Kerr-Newman solution and that of the electron, we discuss additional such coincidences relating to the Kerr-Newman multipoles and properties of the electron. In contrast to the Coulomb field, this spinning Maxwell field has a finite Lagrangian. Moreover, by evaluating the Lagrangian for the superposition of two such Kerr-Newman electromagnetic fields on a flat background, we are able to find their interaction potential. This yields a correction to the Coulomb interaction due to the spin of the field.</description>

      <title>Electron collision studies on the CH$_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculations are performed for electron collision with the methylene molecular ion CH$_2^+$ in its bent equilibrium geometry, with the goal to obtain cross sections for electron impact excitation and dissociation. The polyatomic version of the UK molecular R-matrix codes was used to perform an initial configuration-interaction calculation on the doublet and quartet states of the CH$_2^+$ ion. Subsequently, scattering calculations are performed to obtain electron impact electronic excitation and dissociation cross sections and, additionally, the bound states of the CH$_2$ molecule and Feshbach resonances in the $e$-CH$_2^+$ system.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy factor spectra for weakly allowed electronic transitions in chiral ketones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemical calculations of one-photon absorption, electronic circular dichroism and anisotropy factor spectra for the A-band transition of fenchone, camphor and 3-methylcyclopentanone (3MCP) are reported. While the only weakly allowed nature of the transition leads to comparatively large anisotropies, a proper theoretical description of the absorption for such a transition requires to account for non-Condon effects. We present experimental data for the anisotropy of 3MCP in the liquid phase and show that corresponding Herzberg-Teller corrections are critical to reproduce the main experimental features. The results obtained with our comprehensive theoretical model highlight the importance of the vibrational degree of freedom, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the dynamics in electronic circular dichroism.</description>

      <title>Functionalized mm-scale vapor cells for alkali-metal spectroscopy and magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe micro-fabricated rubidium vapor cells with integrated temperature-control functionality and demonstrate their suitability for use in miniaturized ultra-sensitive magnetometers. These functionalized vapor cells (FVCs) embody a dual-chamber design in low-conductivity silicon with anti-permeation coatings and micro-structured thin-film platinum surface traces as resistive heaters and temperature sensors. Thermal tests show our ability to control alkali metal distribution within the FVCs, ensuring a clean sensing chamber for optical measurements. Optical absorption spectroscopy is used to correlate the temperature readings with vapor density and to measure buffer gas pressure, of interest for optimizing sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate zero-field resonance magnetometry with 18 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivity in the 10 Hz to 100 Hz band, limited by laser noise and magnetic shield noise, which indicates that the functionalization does not introduce significant magnetic noise.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wavefunctions of Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Matter-wave interferometers with trapped strongly interacting Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement two types of matter-wave interferometers using trapped Bose-condensed Feshbach molecules, from weak to strong interactions. In each case, we focus on investigating interaction effects and their implications for the performance. In the Ramsey-type interferometer where interference between the two motional quantum states in an optical lattice is observed, interparticle interactions are found to induce energy shifts in the states. Consequently, this results in a reduction of the interferometer frequency and introduces a phase shift during the lattice pulses used for state manipulation. Furthermore, nonuniformity leads to dephasing and collisional effects contribute to the degradation of contrast. In the Michelson-type interferometer, where matter waves are spatially split and recombined in a waveguide, interference is observed in the presence of significant interaction, however coherence degrades with increasing interaction strength. Notably, coherence is also observed in thermal clouds, indicating the white-light nature of the implemented Michelson-type interferometer.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>
