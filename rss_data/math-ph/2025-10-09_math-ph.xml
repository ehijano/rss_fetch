      <title>An Approach to Anti-Wick Ordering of Bosonic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for putting general boson fields into ant-Wick ordered form. The anti-Wick map associates an operator with a given function of complex variables, and we show that it may be realized as composition of a mapping to a commutative sub-algebra of a doubled-up boson algebra followed by a partial conditional expectation onto one of the factors.</description>

      <title>Appearance of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon in a discrete Airy equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete variant of the Airy equation, formulated as an advance-delay equation, to reveal that discretization induces the higher-order Stokes phenomenon, which is not present in the continuous Airy function and is typically only encountered in solutions to third-order or higher linear homogeneous, or nonlinear, differential equations. Using steepest descent and direct series methods, we derive asymptotic solutions and the Stokes structure. Our analysis shows that discretization produces a more intricate Stokes structure, containing higher-order Stokes phenomena and infinite accumulations of Stokes and anti-Stokes curves. The latter feature is a strictly nonlinear effect in continuous differential equations. We show that this unusual behavior can be generated in a discrete equation from a linear discretization. Numerical simulations confirm the predictions, and a direct comparison with the continuous Airy equation explains how the discretization alters the Stokes structure.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Hankel determinant and orthogonal polynomials arising from the information theory of MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hankel determinant and orthogonal polynomials with respect to the deformed Laguerre weight $$ w(x; t) = {x^\alpha }{\mathrm e^{ - x}}{(x + t)^\lambda },\qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^{+}, $$ with parameters $\alpha &gt; -1,\; t &gt; 0$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. This problem originates from the information theory of single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems studied by Chen and McKay [{\em IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory} {\bf 58} ({2012}) {4594--4634}]. By using the ladder operators for orthogonal polynomials with general Laguerre-type weights, we obtain a system of difference equations and a system of differential-difference equations for the recurrence coefficients $\alpha_n(t)$ and $\beta_n(t)$. We also show that the orthogonal polynomials satisfy a second-order ordinary differential equation. By using Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach, we obtain the large $n$ asymptotic expansions of the recurrence coefficients $\alpha_n(t)$ and $\beta_n(t)$, the sub-leading coefficient $\mathrm p(n, t)$ of the monic orthogonal polynomials, the Hankel determinant $D_n(t)$ and the normalized constant $h_n(t)$ for fixed $t\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$. We also discuss the long-time asymptotics of these quantities as $t\rightarrow\infty$ for fixed $n\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Stress concentration via quasi-Minnaert resonance in bubble-elastic structures and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress concentration in bubble-elastic scattering scenarios has significant applications in engineering blasting and medical treatments. This study provides a comprehensive mathematical analysis of stress concentration in bubbly-elastic structures, induced by the quasi-Minnaert resonance. The quasi-Minnaert resonance manifests as two distinct wave patterns near the bubble's boundary: boundary localization and high-oscillation phenomena. We demonstrate how to leverage the quasi-Minnaert resonance to induce stress concentration in the elastic total wave field near the air bubble's boundary by appropriately selecting the incident elastic wave and high-contrast structure. The interaction between the air bubble and the elastic background couples two physical wave fields-acoustic and elastic waves-across the bubble's boundary. The intricate transmission conditions, combined with the scalar nature of acoustic waves and the vectorial nature of elastic waves, present significant analytical challenges. To address these, we employ layer potential theory and asymptotic analysis to rigorously establish the stress concentration and quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomena in a radially geometry bubble-elastic model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the stress concentration phenomenon alongside quasi-Minnaert resonance for various bubble geometries, including a unit disk, a corner domain, an apple-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and a ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The findings of this study enhance the understanding of stress concentration mechanisms and their applications in engineering blasting and medical therapies.</description>

      <title>Lepage equivalents for second order Lagrangians and applications: $2D$ modified higher order Boussinesq-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the frame of the Lagrangian formalism on $r$-order prolongations of fibered manifolds and related structures such as (prolongation of) projectable vector fields, (sheaves of) differential forms and contact structures, we propose a Lagrangian two-field derivation of $2D$ modified Boussinesq equations, obtained as coupled systems of Euler--Lagrange (E-L) equations for the two fields. By means of a recursive formula involving geometric integration by parts formulae, we construct extended `full' equivalents of such Lagrangians, in particular of Krupka--Betounes type, by which the equations are obtained straightly as the $1$-contact component of their exterior differential. As a main result we find {\em new $2D$ fourth- and sixth-order modified Boussinesq-type equations}, containing mixed terms in both the spatial variables $x$ and $y$. As a byproduct, we also obtain a {\em $2$-field variational characterization} of the stationary reduction of the moving-frame (according to Bogdanov and Zakharov) KP equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curve for strips geometries, Topological Recursion and open GW/DT invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open topological string partition function gives rise to open Gromov-Witten invariants, open Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 3D-5D BPS indices. Utilizing the remodelling conjecture which connects topological recursion and topological string theory, in this paper we study open topological string theory for the subclass of toric Calabi-Yau threefold known as strip geometries. For this purpose, certain new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through this we derive the open topological string partition function and also the associated quantum curve. We also explain how this is related the open Donaldson-Thomas partition function associated with certain symmetric quivers, exponential networks and $q$-Barnes type integrals. In the process, we also connect how 3D-5D wall crossing affects these partition functions as one varies $x$, in examples.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the Darboux III quantum nonlinear oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Darboux III oscillator is an exactly solvable $N$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator defined on a radially symmetric space with non-constant negative curvature. Its one-dimensional version can be seen as a position dependent mass system whose mass function $\mu = (1 + \lambda x^2)$ depends on the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$, such that in the limit $\lambda \to 0$ the harmonic oscillator is recovered. In this paper, a detailed study of the entropic moments and of the R\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the quantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In particular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in position space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III wave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of these quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between the entropy parameter $\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\lambda$ is analysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in the limits $\alpha \to 1$ and $\lambda \to 0$, respectively. Finally, motivated by the strong non-linear effects arising when large values of $\lambda$ and/or highly excited states are considered, an approximation to the probability density function valid in those regimes is presented. From it, an analytical approximation to the probability density in momentum space can be obtained, and some of the previously observed effects arising from the interplay between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ can be explained.</description>

      <title>A Commuting Hamiltonian Framework for Quantum Time Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework for quantum time transfer based on commuting families of Hamiltonians and synchronization observables. The synchronization subspace is defined as the kernel of a difference operator between local clocks, and we show that this subspace is preserved exactly by a commutative $*$-subalgebra of Hamiltonians compatible with the clocks. Our first main result establishes \emph{perturbative stability}: for $\epsilon$-compatible dynamics, where the commutator with the synchronization operator is bounded in norm by $\epsilon$, we prove quantitative drift bounds showing that timing correlations degrade at most linearly in time with slope proportional to $\epsilon$. Our second main result provides a \emph{representation-theoretic classification}: in the presence of a finite group symmetry, the synchronization subspace coincides with the diagonal isotypic component in the tensor product decomposition, and synchronization preservation is characterized by the commutant algebra of the group action. These results identify synchronization as a structural invariant of operator algebras, connecting approximate commutation, kernel-preserving dynamics, and symmetry protection. Beyond quantum time transfer, the framework suggests categorical and resource-theoretic generalizations and contributes to the broader study of operator-algebraic invariants in multipartite quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Vanishing of the Success Probability in Shor's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shor's factoring algorithm guarantees a success probability of at least one half for any fixed modulus N = pq with distinct primes p and q. We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -&gt; infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N &lt;= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the "expected polynomial time" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Beyond the non-Hermitian skin effect: scaling-controlled topology from Exceptional-Bound Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Generalised quantum Sanov theorem revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two families of quantum states $A$ and $B$, called the null and the alternative hypotheses, quantum hypothesis testing is the task of determining whether an unknown quantum state belongs to $A$ or $B$. Mistaking $A$ for $B$ is a type I error, and vice versa for the type II error. In quantum Shannon theory, a fundamental role is played by the Stein exponent, i.e. the asymptotic rate of decay of the type II error probability for a given threshold on the type I error probability. Stein exponents have been thoroughly investigated -- and, sometimes, calculated. However, most currently available solutions apply to settings where the hypotheses simple (i.e. composed of a single state), or else the families $A$ and $B$ need to satisfy stringent constraints that exclude physically important sets of states, such as separable states or stabiliser states. In this work, we establish a general formula for the Stein exponent where both hypotheses are allowed to be composite: the alternative hypothesis $B$ is assumed to be either composite i.i.d. or arbitrarily varying, with components taken from a known base set, while the null hypothesis $A$ is fully general, and required to satisfy only weak compatibility assumptions that are met in most physically relevant cases -- for instance, by the sets of separable or stabiliser states. Our result extends and subsumes the findings of [BBH, CMP 385:55, 2021] (that we also simplify), as well as the 'generalised quantum Sanov theorem' of [LBR, arXiv:2408.07067]. The proof relies on a careful quantum-to-classical reduction via measurements, followed by an application of the results on classical Stein exponents obtained in [Lami, arXiv:today]. We also devise new purely quantum techniques to analyse the resulting asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <title>A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent, i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction' statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modeling of knowledge and wealth dynamics in national and global markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a kinetic model to describe the dynamical evolution of wealth and knowledge in national and global markets, starting from a microscopic description of individual interactions. The model is built upon interaction rules that account for a strong interdependence between the microscopic variables, influencing agents' trading and saving propensities, knowledge acquisition, and the stochastic market effects. We begin with a domestic market scenario and extend the framework to international trade, incorporating the possibility of individual transfers between different countries. The dynamics of the system are described through Boltzmann-type equations, which allow for a detailed study of the evolution of the agent distribution in each country. In this context, we study the evolution of macroscopic quantities of the system, focusing on the number density of individuals, and the mean wealth and knowledge of each population, and we discuss these results in relation to existing models in the literature. Finally, under a quasi-invariant trading limit, we derive simplified Fokker-Planck type equations that reveal some emergent behaviors of the system, including the formation of Pareto tails in the long-term wealth and knowledge distributions.</description>

      <title>Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices, which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state, as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions, the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general theorems in various concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild transformation of the Benenti-Francaviglia metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.</description>

      <title>Influence of coil geometry and coil-plasma distance on the magnetic field approximation error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate analytically two questions:
  1) How does the coil geometry influence the effect of electric current noise on the induced magnetic field?
  2) How does the coil-plasma distance influence our ability to control the pointwise magnetic field error in terms of the average magnetic field error?
  Regarding (1), we argue that the main geometric quantities of interest are the notion of reach and the volume of the region enclosed by the coils. Our main finding is a quantitative formula which shows that the larger the reach and the smaller the volume of the region enclosed by the coils, the smaller is the influence of the electric current uncertainty on the magnetic fields.
  Regarding (2), we show that the pointwise magnetic field error can be controlled (modulo an explicit constant) by the average square-magnetic field-error times $(\text{coil-plasma distance})^{-\frac{3}{2}}$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated and fast magnetic reconnection through enhanced resistive dissipation for MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection, namely a change in the topology of magnetic lines, for sufficiently regular solutions of the three-dimensional periodic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We provide examples where magnetic reconnection occurs on time scales shorter than the resistive one, due to enhanced dissipation emerging from advective effects. This is the first analytical result where the advection term plays an active role in the reconnection process. A key aspect of our approach is a new estimate for enhanced diffusion of high Sobolev norms, which is of independent interest beyond its application to the MHD equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06941v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the effective integration theory of Lie-graph algebras, developed recently by the authors, to the deformation and homotopy theories of types of bialgebras, that is structures controlled by a properad, like associative bialgebras, (involutive) Lie bialgebras, Frobenius bialgebras, double Poisson bialgebras, pre-Calabi--Yau algebras, quantum Airy structures, etc. In these cases, we provide their associated Deligne groupoid with an explicit homotopical description. We settle the Koszul hierarchy and the twisting procedure on the properadic level. We also give a conceptual construction of the homotopy transfer theorem in terms of gauge actions. This work extends the formulas for the deformation theory of operadic algebras.</description>

      <title>TBA and wall-crossing for deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a polynomial superpotential with $\hbar$-correction. In the minimal chamber, where all turning points are real and distinct, it was shown that the exact WKB periods obey the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the undeformed potential. By changing the energy parameter above/below the critical points, the turning points become complex, and the moduli are outside of the minimal chamber. We study the wall-crossing of the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended TBA equations by this change of moduli and show that the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-structure is preserved after the wall-crossing. In particular, the TBA equations for the cubic superpotential are studied in detail, where there are two chambers (minimal and maximal). At the maximally symmetric point in the maximal chamber, the TBA system becomes the two sets of the $D_3$-type TBA equations, which are regarded as the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extension of the $A_3/{\mathbb Z}_2$-TBA equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of models described by two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. The study focuses mainly on the presence of exact static solutions which satisfy the first-order formalism, in models constructed to engender Lorentz symmetry violation. We start by exploring a direct connection between Lorentz breaking and geometric constraint, as experimentally examined in the case of domain walls in geometrically constrained magnetic materials. By means of a specific choice of functions, we show that imposing geometric constraint within the Lorentz-violating framework recovers the exact solutions of the corresponding Lorentz-invariant theory. Furthermore, we extend the investigation to new models that go beyond reproducing the Lorentz invariant geometrically constrained solutions, revealing that it remains possible to parametrize the first-order equation of one of the fields through a suitably redefined coordinate.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation with nonlinear mobility via chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a derivation of the fourth-order DLSS equation based on an interpretation as a chemical reaction network. We consider the rate equation on the discretized circle for a process in which pairs of particles occupying the same site simultaneously jump to the two neighboring sites; the reverse process involves pairs of particles at adjacent sites simultaneously jumping back to the site located between them. Depending on the rates, in the vanishing-mesh-size limit we obtain either the classical DLSS equation or a variant with nonlinear mobility of power type. Via EDP convergence, we identify the limiting gradient structure to be driven by entropy with respect to a generalization of diffusive transport with nonlinear mobility. Interestingly, the DLSS equation with power-type mobility shares qualitative similarities with the fast diffusion and porous medium equation, since we find traveling wave solutions with algebraic tails or compactly supported polynomials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Topology of the generalized Brillouin zone of one-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs) are integral in the analysis of non-Hermitian band structures. Conventional wisdom suggests that the GBZ should be connected, where each point can be indexed by the real part of the wavevector, similar to the Brillouin zone. Here we demonstrate rich topological features of the GBZs in generic non-Hermitian one-dimensional models. We prove and discuss a set of sufficient conditions for the model to ensure the connectivity of its GBZ. In addition, we show that the GBZ can become disconnected and have more connected components than the number of bands, which results from the point-gap features of the band structure. This novel GBZ topology is applied to further demonstrate a counterintuitive effect, where the line gap of an open-boundary spectrum with sublattice symmetry may be closed without changing its point-gap topology. Our results challenge the current understanding of bands and gaps in non-Hermitian systems and highlight the need to further investigate the topological effects associated with the GBZ including topological invariants and open-boundary braiding.</description>

      <title>Can One Model Gravitational Nonlinear Memory with Fractional Derivative Operators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Kaniadakis entropy as a measure of quantum correlations through implicit bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we examine the relationship of negative conditional quantum Kaniadakis entropy ($\alpha-$CQKE) with the fully entangled fraction (FEF) which is a substantial yardstick for quantum information processing protocols including teleportation, and quantum steerability, executed over four vital quantum states with maximally mixed marginals, the 2-qubit Werner state, the 2-qubit Weyl state, the 2-qudit Werner state and the isotropic state. We initiate our analysis in 2$\otimes$2 systems where we derive implicit bounds on FEF when the $\alpha-$CQKE takes negative values, i.e. when $\alpha-$CQKE $\in$ $R^{-}$ for 2-qubit Werner state. Consequently, we derive the sufficient implicit bounds for a definitive claim on the non-usefulness of Werner state for quantum teleportation provided its visibility parameter succeeds to elude a critical region, the exception region 1, where the situation becomes inconclusive. Subsequently, we replicate the same for the 2-qubit Weyl state with some constraints augmented by an analogous exception region 2 and the correlation tensor matrix elements. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to d $\otimes$ d states, commencing our analysis with the Isotropic state. We derive implicit bounds on FEF of the Isotropic state and the 2-qudit Werner state resembling the ones in the 2$\otimes$2 analysis. Additionally, we utilize the convoluted relationship between the FEF and quantum steerability to formulate propositions linking negative $\alpha-$CQKE to the k-copy steerability of isotropic states for projective measurements, thereby reducing the intricacy of the study of k-copy steerability directly via FEF. In the appendix section of the article, we provide corroborative calculations and supplementary materials to the theorems presented in the main sections.</description>

      <title>On quantum to classical comparison for Davies generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, our understanding of quantum Markov chains remains far less complete than that of their classical counterparts. [Temme'13] observed that the Davies Lindbladian, a well-studied model of quantum Markov dynamics, contains an embedded classical Markov generator, raising the natural question of how the convergence properties of the quantum and classical dynamics are related. While [Temme'13] showed that the spectral gap of the Davies Lindbladian can be much smaller than that of the embedded classical generator for certain highly structured Hamiltonians, we show that if the spectrum of the Hamiltonian does not contain long arithmetic progressions, then the two spectral gaps must be comparable. As a consequence, we prove that for a large class of Hamiltonians, including those obtained by perturbing a fixed Hamiltonian with a generic external field, the quantum spectral gap remains within a constant factor of the classical spectral gap. Our result aligns with physical intuition and enables the application of classical Markov chain techniques to the quantum setting.
  The proof is based on showing that any ``off-diagonal'' eigenvector of the Davies generator can be used to construct an observable which commutes with the Hamiltonian and has a Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient which can be upper bounded in terms of that of the original eigenvector's Lindbladian Rayleigh quotient. Thus, a spectral gap for such observables implies a spectral gap for the full Davies generator.</description>

      <title>Universal initial state preparation for first quantized quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing symmetry-adapted initial states is a principal bottleneck in first-quantized quantum simulation. We present a universal approach that efficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number configurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum computer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism, which identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their first-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock occupations and $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl decomposition. Operationally, we prepare an encoded superposition of Schur labels via a block-encoded linear combination of unitaries and then apply the inverse quantum Schur transform. The algorithm runs in time $\text{poly}(L, N, d, \log \epsilon^{-1})$ for $L$ configurations of $N$ particles over $d$ modes to accuracy $\epsilon$, and applies universally to fermions, bosons, and Green's paraparticles in arbitrary single-particle bases. Resource estimates indicate practicality within leading first-quantized pipelines; statistics-aware or faster quantum Schur transforms promise further reductions.</description>

      <title>Is it Gaussian? Testing bosonic quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory, characterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of the number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of copies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then extend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies suffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are far. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states necessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a fundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on rotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently introduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds.</description>

      <title>Reflection Maps Associated with Involutions and Factorization Problems, and Their Poisson Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the set-theoretic solutions of the reflection equation, also known as reflection maps, is closely related to that of the Yang-Baxter maps. In this work, we construct reflection maps on various geometrical objects, associated with factorization problems on rational loop groups and involutions. We show that such reflection maps are smoothly conjugate to the composite of permutation maps, with corresponding reduced Yang-Baxter maps. In the case when the reduced Yang-Baxter maps are independent of parameters, the latter are just braiding operators. We also study the symplectic and Poisson geometry of such reflection maps. In a special case, the factorization problems are associated with the collision of N-solitons of the n-Manakov system with a boundary, and in this context the N-body polarization reflection map is a symplectomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

Abstract: We study the essential spectrum, which corresponds to inertia-gravity modes, of the system of equations governing a rotating and self-gravitating gas planet. With certain boundary conditions, we rigorously and precisely characterize the essential spectrum and show how it splits from the portion of the spectrum corresponding to the acoustic modes. The fundamental mathematical tools in our analysis are a generalization of the Helmholtz decomposition and the Lopantinskii conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of multiple radial SLE(0) -- a smooth system of curves in a simply connected domain $\Omega$ with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$ -- arising as the deterministic limit of random multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  We construct multiple radial SLE(0) systems by starting from the stationary relations, which arise heuristically as the $\kappa \to 0$ limit of partition functions. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n\}$.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  In the deterministic case $\kappa = 0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero--Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality asserts that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether distinguishability is preserved after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of the relative entropy of quantum channels. Our first result is that quantum channels with an input dimension greater than or equal to the output dimension do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. We propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for three important classes of quantum channels: depolarizing channels, generalized dephasing channels, and amplitude damping channels. As an application, we give the first rigorous construction of level-1 less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable.</description>

Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov system and trigonometric Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to obtain a complete characterization of soliton and breather interactions in the integrable discrete Manakov (IDM) system, a vector generalization of the Ablowitz-Ladik model. The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation in presence of a uniform and fixed gravity field, in the case of Maxwell molecules. We first obtain a well-posedness result in the space of finite, non-negative Radon measures. In addition, we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the external field. We further show that this stationary solution is unique in the class of the finite, non-negative Radon measures with finite first order moment, and that all the solutions in this class converge towards the stationary solution in the weak topology of the measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$.
  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative.
  When $\Omega$ is taken to be the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$.
  Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns.
  For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero--Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Multi-Qubit Phase-Space Part I: Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</description>

      <title>Logical Dependence of Physical Determinism on Set-theoretic Metatheory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baroque questions of set-theoretic foundations are widely assumed to be irrelevant to physics. In this article, I demonstrate that this assumption is incorrect. I show that the fundamental physical question of whether a theory is deterministic, whether it fixes a unique future given the present, can depend on one's choice of set-theoretic axiom candidates over which there is intractable disagreement. This dependence is not confined to hypothetical examples. It reaches into mainstream and frontier physics, including the dynamics of Kerr-like black hole interiors. One upshot of the discussion is that either physical theories must be relativized to set-theoretic metatheories (in which case physics itself becomes relative), or the search for new axioms to settle undecidables may admit of empirical input.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, a central result in quantum information theory that characterizes the resources needed to simulate quantum channels when entanglement is freely available. We derive a universal additive upper bound on the smoothed max-information in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi mutual information. This bound yields tighter single-shot results, eliminates the need for the post-selection technique, and leads to a conceptually simpler proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. By consolidating and streamlining earlier approaches, our result provides a clearer and more direct understanding of the resource costs of simulating quantum channels.</description>
