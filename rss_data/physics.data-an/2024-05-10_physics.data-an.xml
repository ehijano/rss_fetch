      <title>Network science Ising states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science provides very powerful tools for extracting information from interacting data. Although recently the unsupervised detection of phases of matter using machine learning has raised significant interest, the full prediction power of network science has not yet been systematically explored in this context. Here we fill this gap by providing an in-depth statistical, combinatorial, geometrical and topological characterization of 2D Ising snapshot networks (IsingNets) extracted from Monte Carlo simulations of the $2$D Ising model at different temperatures, going across the phase transition. Our analysis reveals the complex organization properties of IsingNets in both the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases and demonstrates the significant deviations of the IsingNets with respect to randomized null models. In particular percolation properties of the IsingNets reflect the existence of the symmetry between configurations with opposite magnetization below the critical temperature and the very compact nature of the two emerging giant clusters revealed by our persistent homology analysis of the IsingNets. Moreover, the IsingNets display a very broad degree distribution and significant degree-degree correlations and weight-degree correlations demonstrating that they encode relevant information present in the configuration space of the $2$D Ising model. The geometrical organization of the critical IsingNets is reflected in their spectral properties deviating from the one of the null model. This work reveals the important insights that network science can bring to the characterization of phases of matter. The set of tools described hereby can be applied as well to numerical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination and Quantum Radar: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of the probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an action formalism to calculate probabilities of rare events in cluster-cluster aggregation for arbitrary collision kernels and establish a pathwise large deviation principle with total mass being the rate. As an application, the rate function for the number of surviving particles as well as the optimal evolution trajectory are calculated exactly for the constant, sum and product kernels. For the product kernel, we argue that the second derivative of the rate function has a discontinuity. The theoretical results agree with simulations tailored to the calculation of rare events.</description>
