      <title>Atmospheric collapse and re-inflation through impacts for terrestrial planets around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of an atmosphere around a terrestrial exoplanet will be a major milestone in the field, but our observational capacities are biased towards to tidally locked, close-in planets orbiting M-dwarf stars. The atmospheres of these planets are vulnerable to atmospheric erosion and collapse due to condensation of volatiles on the nightside. However, these collapsed volatiles accumulated as nightside ice constitute a stable reservoir that could be re-vaporised by meteorite impacts and re-establish the atmospheres. Through a simple energy balance model applied to atmospheric evolution simulations with stochastic impacts, we assess the viability and importance of this mechanism for CO$_2$ atmospheres. We find that moderate-sized impactors ($5-10 \rm{km}$ diameter) occurring at a frequency of $1-100 \rm{Gyr}^{-1}$ can regenerate observable transient atmospheres on previously airless planets. We focus on specific targets from the JWST DDT Rocky Worlds programme, and compute the fraction of their evolution spent with a transient CO$_2$ atmosphere generated through this mechanism. We find this fraction can reach $70\%$ for GJ 3929 b, $50\%$ for LTT 1445 Ac, $80\%$ for LTT 1445 Ab, at high impact rates and strong CO$_2$ outgassing over the planet's lifetime. We also show that atmospheric collapse can shield volatiles from escape, particularly in the early, high-XUV phase of M-dwarf evolution. Overall, our work suggests that terrestrial planet atmospheres may not evolve monotonically but instead may be shaped by episodic external forcings.</description>

      <title>NEOForCE: Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust impact monitoring of near-Earth objects is an essential task of planetary defense. Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of Pisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent approaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate predictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for asteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at Paris Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty propagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact assessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As other monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids from the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into the future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids with the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the realistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along their osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and only if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this second step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so that the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm the possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE against NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344, 2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2025 JU. NEOForCE successfully recovered nearly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities above e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE identified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did not report.</description>

      <title>Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.</description>

      <title>How does ice shell geometry shape ocean dynamics on icy moons?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poleward-thinning ice shell can drive circulation in the subsurface oceans of icy moons by imposing a meridional temperature gradient--colder at the equator than the pole--through the freezing point suppression due to pressure. This temperature gradient sets a buoyancy gradient, whose sign depends on the thermal expansion coefficient determined by ocean salinity. Together with vertical mixing, this buoyancy forcing shapes key oceanic features, including zonal currents in thermal wind balance, baroclinic instability of those currents, meridional heat transport by eddies, and vertical stratification. We use high-resolution numerical simulations to explore how variations in ice shell thickness affect these processes. Our simulations span a wide range of topographic slopes, pole-to-equator temperature differences, and vertical mixing strengths, for both fresh and salty oceans. We find that baroclinic eddies dominate large-scale circulation and meridional heat transport, consistent with studies assuming a flat ice-ocean interface. However, sloped topography introduces new effects: when lighter water overlies denser water along the slope, circulation weakens as a stratified layer thickens beneath the poles. Conversely, when denser water lies beneath the poles, circulation strengthens as topography increases the available potential energy. We develop a scaling framework that predicts heat transport and stratification across all simulations. Applying this framework to Enceladus, Europa, and Titan, we infer ocean heat fluxes, stratification, and tidal energy dissipation and showing large-scale circulation constrains tidal heating and links future observations of ice thickness and rotation to subsurface ocean dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter Origin and Tidal Evolution Constrained by a Broken Age-Frequency Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral observations of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) with JWST/NIRSpec and SPHEREx reveal an extreme CO2 enrichment (CO2/H2O = 7.6+-0.3) that is 4.5 sigma above solar system comet trends and among the highest ever recorded. This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>In space there will be no need to scream - Limits to the presence of giant planets in the $\zeta^2$ Ret system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for life beyond our Solar system has been a long and difficult endeavour. The majority of current efforts are focused on the potential detection of biosignatures. However, their detection and interpretation are extremely challenging. Technosignatures appear as an attractive alternative, given their expected univocal interpretation. In recent years, the number of publications discussing them have skyrocketted, both in their more rigurous and speculative sides. In this article, we explore the 28.8 years of archival radial velocity data of $\zeta^2$ Ret with the aim of detecting the proposed giant planet Calpamos, suspected source of a signal of technological origin. We performed a global model fitting the radial velocity data along with activity indicators and modelled the stellar magnetic cycle and rotation. The analysis rules out the presence of the proposed planet, as well as of any other planets more massive than 2-20 $\mathrm{M}_\oplus$ $m_{p}$ sin $i$, depending on orbital period. We show that the previously identified long-period RV signal is definitively caused by the magnetic cycle of the star.</description>

      <title>Combined Orbital and Thermal Evolution of Oort Cloud Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully integrated model of comet evolution that couples thermal and compositional processes with dynamical processes continuously, from formation to present-day activity. The combined code takes into account changes in orbital parameters that define the heliocentric distance as a function of time, which is fed into the thermal/compositional evolution code. The latter includes a set of volatile species, gas flow through the porous interior, crystallization of amorphous ice, sublimation and refreezing of volatiles in the pores. We follow the evolution of three models, with radii of 2, 10 and 50 km for 4.6 Gyr, through different dynamical epochs, starting in the vicinity of Neptune, moving to the Oort Cloud and after a long sojourn there, back inward to the planetary region. The initial composition includes a mixture of CO, CO2 ices, amorphous water ice with trapped CO and CO2, and dust.We find that the CO ice is completely depleted in the small object, but preserved in the larger ones from a depth of 500 m to the center, while the CO2 and the amorphous ice are entirely preserved. Of crucial importance is the change in CO abundance profiles during the cooling phase, as the objects migrate to the OC. Upon return from the Oort Cloud, the activity is driven by CO sublimation at large heliocentric distances (up to 50 au), by CO2 inward of 13 au and by gas released from crystallizing amorphous ice at about 7 au. We test the effect of radioactive heating by long-lived isotopes and find that it is negligible. Considering sub-solar temperatures and limited active areas, we show that CO2 production rates can exceed the detection limit as far out as 25 au.</description>

      <title>The Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements: Population Level Trends in Exoplanet Composition with ExoComp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present-day bulk elemental composition of an exoplanet can provide insight into a planet's formation and evolutionary history. Such information is now being measured for dozens of planets with state-of-the-art facilities using Bayesian atmosphere retrievals. We collect measurements of exoplanet composition of gas giants into a Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements for comparison on a population level. We develop an open-source toolkit, ExoComp, to standardize between solar abundance, metallicity, and C/O ratio definitions. We find a systematic enhancement in the metallicity of exoplanets compared to T-dwarf and stellar populations, a strict bound in C/O between 0 and 1, and statistically significant differences between measurements from direct, eclipse, and transmission spectroscopy. In particular, the transit spectroscopy population exhibits a systematically lower C/O ratio compared to planets observed with eclipse and direct spectroscopy. While such differences may be astrophysical signals, we discuss many of the challenges and subtleties of such a comparison. We characterize the mass-metallicity trend, finding a slope consistent between planets measured in transit versus eclipse, but offset in metallicity. Compared to the Solar System and constraints from interior modeling, gas giant atmospheres appear to exhibit a steeper mass-metallicity trend. We hope that the tools available in ExoComp and the data in the Library of Exoplanet Atmospheric Composition Measurements can enhance the science return of the wide-array of space- and ground-based exoplanet science being undertaken by the community.</description>

      <title>Tidally driven inertial waves enhance eccentricity damping and spin evolution in planets and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.</description>

      <title>The ODYSSEUS Survey. Spatial correlation of magnetospheric inclinations points to parsec-scale star-cloud connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of stars and planets are shaped by the initial conditions of their natal clouds. However, the spatial scales over which the initial conditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We report the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar magnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass star forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.</description>

      <title>Planetary Obliquity Excitation Through Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A planet's axial tilt ("obliquity") substantially affects its atmosphere and habitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: Polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics II. A three-moment gamma distribution formulation for GCM applications</title>

Abstract: Context. Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions affects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to explore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where observations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore important to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence the size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed atmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our sub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to include effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution, requiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a three-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical nucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma distribution. As in the previous paper, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using a simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the results with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a generalised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment generation expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution evolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower pressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud structures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the atmosphere. Conclusions. We present a self-consistent framework for including the effects of polydispersity for sub-stellar microphysical cloud studies using the moment method.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since. Formation is thought to proceed by clumping of dust particles in protoplanetary disk gas by the streaming instability, followed by gravitational collapse. Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the &gt;99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of ~100 km, and the relative proportion of prograde to retrograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB. Outstanding problems are identified.</description>

      <title>Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Origins of Super-Puff Planets: A New Mass-Loss Regime Coupled to Planetary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-puffs are a class of low-mass, large-radius planets that have challenged planet formation and evolution models. Their high inferred H/He mass fractions, required to explain their physical sizes, would lead to rapid atmospheric escape, raising questions about their long-term retention. Recent modeling work indicates that low-mass planets typically require 50\% less H/He mass to match their observed radius, due to significant roles of the radiative atmosphere and interior heating from the rock/iron core. Here, through a new quantitative analysis of XUV-driven escape in sub-Neptunes, we find that previous studies overestimated mass loss, as scaling laws in low-gravity regimes deviate greatly from the widely used energy-limited regime. We define a new regime, thermal-energy-mediated photoevaporation (TEMP), in which thermal energy conversion critically sets the mass-loss rate. These effects make super-puffs more resilient to mass loss than previously thought. We develop a coupled evolution model integrating this updated thermal evolution framework with a 1D hydrodynamic photoevaporation model. Applying this novel, joint model to observed super-puffs and young low-density planets, we find that their masses, radii and transit pressures align with predictions assuming either a clear or hazy atmosphere. This indicates that super-puffs have undergone a combination of boil-off and photoevaporative mass loss, with boil-off dominating the process. Our results indicate that low-density planets typically possess both a thick convective envelope and substantial radiative atmosphere, which contribute to their large radii. For this to occur, these planets must have intermediate masses of 5-10$M_\oplus$ and receive stellar insolation $\lesssim 30F_\oplus$, favoring FG-type stars over M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Magrathea v2: A planetary interior modeling platform in C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magrathea is an open-source C++ code for modeling the internal structure of differentiated planets. The initial release, Huang et al. (2022), introduced the base solver, a modular framework for defining equations of state (EOSs) used within phase diagrams for each differentiated layer, and outlined a series of planned extensions. Many of those updates are now implemented. Magrathea v2 is a more versatile platform that supports a wider range of compositions, adds new tools for composition retrieval, and makes it easier for users to adapt the code to their own models.</description>
