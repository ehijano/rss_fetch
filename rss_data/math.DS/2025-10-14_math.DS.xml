      <title>Learning interpretable closures for thermal radiation transport in optically-thin media using WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an equation learning framework to identify a closed set of equations for moment quantities in 1D thermal radiation transport (TRT) in optically thin media. While optically thick media admits a well-known diffusive closure, the utility of moment closures in providing accurate low-dimensional surrogates for TRT in optically thin media is unclear, as the mean-free path of photons is large and the radiation flux is far from its Fickean limit. Here, we demonstrate the viability of using weak-form equation learning to close the system of equations for the energy density, radiation flux, and temperature in optically thin TRT. We show that the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), together with an advantageous change of variables and an auxiliary equation for the radiation-energy-weighted opacity, enables robust and efficient identification of closures that preserve many desired physical properties from the high fidelity system, including hyperbolicity, rotational symmetry, black-body equilibria, and linear stability of black-body equilibria, all of which manifest as library constraints or convex constraints on the closure coefficients. Crucially, the weak form enables closures to be learned from simulation data with ray effects and particle noise, which then do not appear in simulations of the resulting closed moment system. Finally, we demonstrate that our closure models can be extrapolated in the key system parameters of drive temperature $T_{in}$ and scalar opacity $\gamma$, and this extrapolation is to an extent quantifiable by a Knudsen-like dimensionless parameter.</description>

      <title>Outer length billiards on polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical inner and outer billiards can be formulated in variational terms, with length and area as the respective generating functions. The other two combinations, ``inner with area'' and ``outer with length,'' are more recently described. Here, we consider the latter system in the special case of polygonal tables. We describe the behavior of orbits far away from the table and pose conjectures regarding an escaping orbit when the table is a square. This paper is meant to complement arXiv:2510.08370 which handles smooth tables with positive curvature.</description>

      <title>Furstenberg systems of certain sequences of superpolynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give examples of sequences defined by smooth functions of intermediate growth, and we study the Furstenberg systems that model their statistical behavior. In particular, we show that the systems are Bernoulli. We do so by studying exponential sums that reflect the strong equidistribution properties of said sequences. As a by-product of our approach, we also get some convergence results.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of symbolic dynamical systems called homshifts: they are the nearest-neighbour $\mathbb{Z}^d$ shifts of finite type whose adjacency rules are the same in every direction. Building on the work of Klaus Schmidt (Pacific J. Math. 170 (1995), no.1, 237-269) we give a necessary and sufficient condition for their cohomological triviality. This condition is expressed in terms of the topology of a natural simplicial complex arising from the shift space which can be analyzed in many natural cases. However, we preove that in general, cohomological triviality is algorithmically undecidable for homshifts.</description>

      <title>Rotation sets for random compositions of $\T$ homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cocycles of homeomorphisms of $\T$ in the isotopy class of the identity over shift spaces, using as a tool a novel definition of rotation sets inspired in the classical work of Miziurewicz and Zieman. We discuss different notions of rotation sets, for the full cocyle as well as for measures invariant by the shift dynamics on the base. We present some initial results on the shape of rotation sets, continuity of rotation sets for shift-invariant measures, and bounded displacements for irrotational cocyles, as well as a few interesting examples in an attempt to motive the development of the topic.</description>

      <title>An elementary derivation of 3-cycles for a quadratic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an elementary derivation of the period-three cycles for the real quadratic map $x\mapsto x^2+c$, a fundamental model in one-dimensional discrete dynamics. Using symmetric polynomials, we obtain a complete algebraic characterization of 3-cycles and determine explicit conditions for their existence and stability, without reliance on computer algebra. Through conjugacy with the logistic map, we recover the classical threshold values of the logistic parameter corresponding to the emergence and loss of stability of the 3-cycle. Our methodology outlines a transparent and algebraically grounded route to understanding the onset of chaos in quadratic and logistic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Limit Laws for Poincar\'e Recurrence and the Shrinking Target Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,T,\mu,d)$ be a metric measure-preserving system. If $B(x,r_n(x))$ is a sequence of balls such that, for each $n$, the measure of $B(x,r_n(x))$ is constant, then we obtain a self-norming CLT for recurrence for systems satisfying a multiple decorrelation property. When $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, we obtain a distributional limit law for recurrence for the sequence of balls $B(x,r_n)$. In the latter case, the density of the limiting distribution is an average over Gaussian densities. An important assumption in the CLT for recurrence is that the CLT holds for the shrinking target problem. Because of this, we also prove an ASIP for expanding and Axiom A systems for non-autonomous H\"older observables and apply it to the shrinking target problem, thereby obtaining a CLT.</description>

      <title>On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the density of coadjoint orbits, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

      <title>Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systems of coupled units in a general network configuration with a coupling delay. We show that the destabilizing bifurcations from an equilibrium are governed by the extreme eigenvalues of the coupling matrix of the network. Based on the equivariant degree method and its computational packages, we perform a symmetry classification of destabilizing bifurcations in bidirectional rings of coupled units. Both stationary and oscillatory bifurcations are discussed. We also introduce the concept of secondary dominating orbit types to capture bifurcating solutions of submaximal nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of political opinion are a critical component of modern society with large-scale implications for the evolution of intra- and international political discourse and policy. Here we utilize recent high-resolution survey data to quantitatively capture leading-order psychological and information-environmental patterns. We then inform simulations of a theoretical dynamical framework with several different models for how populations' ideology evolves over time, including a model which reproduces current macro-scale ideological distributions given the empirical micro-scale data gathered. This effort represents an attempt to discover true underlying trends of political reasoning in general audiences, and to extrapolate the long-term implications of those trends as they interact with the political exposure landscape. Accurate modeling of this ecosystem has the potential to predict catastrophic outcomes such as hyperpolarization, and to inform effective intervention strategies aimed at preserving and rebuilding constructive political communication.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Small Points for Rational Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $f: \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ with at most $s$ places of bad reduction, where we include all archimedean places. We prove that there exists constants $c_1,c_2 &gt; 0$, depending only on $d$ and not on $f$ or $K$, such that $$ \# \left\{ x \in \mathbb{P}^1(K) \mid \widehat{h}_f(x) \leq \frac{c_1}{s} h_{\operatorname{rat}_d}(\langle f \rangle) \right\} \leq c_2 s \log(s). $$ Here, $\operatorname{rat}_d$ is the moduli space of rational maps up to conjugacy, $h_{\operatorname{rat}_d}$ is an ample height and $\langle f \rangle$ is the equivalence class associated to $f$. This gives a uniform version of a theorem of Baker as well as generalizing the results of Benedetto and Looper from polynomials to rational maps. The main tool used is the degeneration of sequences of rational maps by Luo which has been recently formalized by Favre-Gong via Berkovich spaces.</description>

      <title>Finte-size induced random switching of chimeras in a deterministic two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for interacting populations of phase oscillators exhibits chimera states whereby one population is synchronised and the other is desynchronised. Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saturn's moon Enceladus is an exciting destination for future exploration missions due to the scientifically interesting geyser region located on its South pole. In this work, we compile the different types of science orbit configurations that have been proposed in the literature and present numerical methods to compute each of them in the Saturn-Enceladus circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). In addition, we explore the utility of the higher period dynamical structures found in the CR3BP. Figures of merit such as the observational properties and geometries for each family of orbits are presented. By providing a consistent analysis of potential Enceladus science orbits, this work can serve as a baseline for future mission designs.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behaviour of holomorphic self-maps of the upper half-plane. More precisely, we focus on the hyperbolic and parabolic self-maps whose orbits approach the Denjoy--Wolff point with the slowest possible rate. We characterize self-maps of such extremal rate using various tools, like the Herglotz representation, the conformality of the Koenigs function at the Denjoy--Wolff point and the hyperbolic distance.</description>

      <title>Frequency conditions for the global stability of nonlinear delay equations with several equilibria</title>

Abstract: In our adjacent work, we developed a spectral comparison principle for compound cocycles generated by delay equations. It allows to derive frequency inequalities for the uniform exponential stability of such cocycles by means of their comparison with stationary problems. Such inequalities are hard to verify purely analytically, and in this work we develop approximation schemes to verify some of the arising frequency inequalities. Besides some general theoretical results, in applications we stick to the case of scalar equations. By means of the Suarez--Schopf delayed oscillator and the Mackey--Glass equations, we demonstrate applications of the theory to reveal regions in the space of parameters where the absence of closed invariant contours can be guaranteed. Since the frequency inequalities are robust, so close systems also satisfy them, we expect the method to actually imply the global stability, as in known finite-dimensional results utilizing variants of the closing lemma, which is still awaiting developments in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Mean dimension explosion of induced homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $X$ a compact metric space and $T: X \to X$ a continuous map, the induced hyperspace map $T_\mathcal{K}$ acts on the hyperspace $\mathcal{K}(X)$ of closed and nonempty subsets of $X$, and on the continuum hyperspace $\mathcal{C}(X) \subset \mathcal{K}(X)$ of connected sets. This work studies the mean dimension explosion phenomenon: when the base system $T$ has zero topological entropy, but the mean dimension of the induced map $T_\mathcal{K}$ is infinite. In particular, this phenomenon occurs for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, for a circle homeomorphism $H$, the mean dimension explosion does not occur if and only if $H$ is conjugate to a rotation. For the metric mean dimension, a different result is obtained: we establish sufficient conditions for the induced hyperspace map to have zero or infinite metric mean dimension.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>An "adaptive" approach to control explosive aphid populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical models of aphid population dynamics are unable to explain multi-peak patterns in field populations. We consider the variable carrying capacity model (VCM), which can generate such complex multi-peak dynamics, but is also demonstrated to show finite-time blow-up behavior via a sign switching structural instability. We build an adaptive behavioral model with a density-dependent switch to stabilize growth, effectively eliminating blow-up, and also capable of generating multiple peaks. Furthermore, guided by empirical work on environment drivers for pests, we devise a non-autonomous model with time-dependent host plant fitness, successfully connecting transient population dynamics with abiotic drivers such as flooding. Finally, we discuss the practical significance of the results through the Economic Threshold (ET) and Economic Injury Level (EIL) calculation for all models. Our simulations all clearly show that aphid abundances exceed these threshold levels, and control is required. Our work provides a stable and biologically relevant prediction scheme for pest outbreaks and their management strategy.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>
