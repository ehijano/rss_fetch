      <title>Hydrodynamic interaction leads to the accumulation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii near a solid-liquid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanism of microbial motion near solid-liquid interfaces is crucial for understanding various biological phenomena and developing ecological applications. However, limited works have been conducted on the swimming behavior of C. reinhardtii, a typical "puller" type cell, near solid surfaces, particularly with varying and conflicting experimental observations. Here, we investigate the swimming behavior of C.reinhardtii using a three-dimensional real-time tracking microscopy system both near a solid-liquid interface and in the fluid bulk region. We explore the relationships between the cell density, swimming speed and orientation with respect to the distance from the solid-liquid interface, confirming the phenomenon of C. reinhardtii accumulation near the solid-liquid interface. Based on the traditional definitions of "pusher" and "puller" cells, we propose a simplified model consisting of two pairs of mutually perpendicular force dipoles for C. reinhardtii. This model is employed to analyze the complex hydrodynamic interactions between C. reinhardtii and the solid surface, providing a potential theoretical explanation for the observed accumulation phenomenon at the solid-liquid interface.</description>

      <title>From noisy cell size control to population growth: when variability can be beneficial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell experiments revealed substantial variability in generation times, growth rates but also in birth and division sizes between genetically identical cells. Understanding how these fluctuations determine the fitness of the population, i.e. its growth rate, is necessary in any quantitative theory of evolution. Here, we develop a biologically-relevant model which accounts for the stochasticity in single-cell growth rates, birth sizes and division sizes. We derive expressions for the population growth rate and for the mean birth size in the population in terms of the single-cell fluctuations. Allowing division sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control (timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth. Surprisingly, we find that fluctuations in single-cell growth rates can be beneficial for population growth when slow-growing cells tend to divide at smaller sizes than fast-growing cells. Our framework is not limited to exponentially-growing cells like $\textit{Escherichia coli}$, and we derive similar expressions for cells with linear and bi-linear growth laws, such as $\textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}$ and fission yeast $\textit{Schizosaccharomyces pombe}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Theory of epigenetic switching due to stochastic histone mark loss during DNA replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much information does a cell inherit from its ancestors beyond its genetic sequence? What are the epigenetic mechanisms that allow this? Despite the rise in available epigenetic data, how such information is inherited through the cell cycle is still not fully understood. Often, epigenetic marks can display bistable behaviour and their bistable state is transmitted to daughter cells through the cell cycle, providing the cell with a form of memory. However, loss-of-memory events also take place, where a daughter cell switches epigenetic state (with respect to the mother cell). Here, we develop a framework to compute these epigenetic switching rates, for the case when they are driven by DNA replication, i.e., the frequency of loss-of-memory events due to replication. We consider the dynamics of histone modifications during the cell cycle deterministically, except at DNA replication, where nucleosomes are randomly distributed between the two daughter DNA strands, which is therefore implemented stochastically. This hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach enables an analytic derivation of the replication-driven switching rate. While retaining great simplicity, this framework can explain experimental switching rate data, establishing its biological importance as a framework to quantitatively study epigenetic inheritance.</description>

      <title>Optimal weights and priors in simultaneous fitting of multiple small-angle scattering datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) are powerful techniques in material science and soft matter. In this study, it was addressed how multiple SAXS or SANS datasets are best weighted when doing simultaneous fitting. Three weighting schemes were tested: (1) equal weighting of all datapoints, (2) equal weighting of each dataset through normalization with the number of datapoints, (3) weighting proportional to the information content. The weighing schemes were assessed by model refinement against synthetic data under numerous conditions. The first weighting scheme led to the most accurate parameter estimation, especially when one dataset substantially outnumbered the other(s). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that inclusion of Gaussian priors significantly improved the accuracy of the refined parameters, as compared to common practice, where each parameter is constrained uniformly within an allowed interval.</description>

      <title>Passive defect driven morphogenesis in nematic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are ubiquitous on surfaces with orientational order fields. Here, we study equilibrium states generated by the feedback between geometry and nematic order on fluid membranes with an integer topological defect. When the Frank elastic constants associated with the orientational field dominate, the surfaces spontaneously deform toward an conical shape featuring an aster topological defect at its apex. In the case of vanishing tension this is a solution to the normal force balance. We show that the stability of the surface depends on the balance of the elastic parameters and the phase of the defect. When boundary constraints are introduced, we observe three distinct modes of deformation. These deformation modes take advantage of the way in which splay, twist and bend distortions of the director field can be exchanged on a curved surface. We discuss how these deformation modes are distinguished by their response to the cost of twist distortions and the existence of inverted solutions. Our findings show that fusion of +1/2 topological defect pairs can reduce the total energy of deformable surfaces. Finally, we argue how these results can be relevant for biological systems.</description>

      <title>Effective extensional-torsional elasticity and dynamics of helical filaments under distributed loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study slender, helical elastic rods subject to distributed forces and moments. Focussing on the case when the helix axis remains straight, we employ the method of multiple scales to systematically derive an 'equivalent-rod' theory from the Kirchhoff rod equations: the helical filament is described as a naturally-straight rod (aligned with the helix axis) for which the extensional and torsional deformations are coupled. Importantly, our analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a 'highly-coiled' filament (when the helical wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic lengthscale over which the filament bends due to external loading) and is able to account for large, unsteady displacements. In addition, our analysis yields explicit conditions on the external loading that must be satisfied for a straight helix axis. In the small-deformation limit, we exactly recover the coupled wave equations used to describe the free vibrations of helical coil springs, thereby justifying previous equivalent-rod approximations in which linearised stiffness coefficients are assumed to apply locally and dynamically. We then illustrate our theory with two loading scenarios: (I) a heavy helical rod deforming under its own weight; and (II) the dynamics of axial rotation (twirling) in viscous fluid, which may be considered as a simple model for a bacteria flagellar filament. In both scenarios, we demonstrate excellent agreement with solutions of the full Kirchhoff rod equations, even beyond the formal limit of validity of the highly-coiled assumption. More broadly, our analysis provides a framework to develop reduced models of helical rods in a wide variety of physical and biological settings, and yields analytical insight into their elastic instabilities. In particular, our analysis indicates that tensile instabilities are a generic phenomenon when both distributed forces and moments are present.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in filamentous cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient and important phyla of organisms that has allowed the evolution of more complex life forms. Despite its importance, the role of motility on the pattern formation of their colonies is not understood. Here, we investigate the large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of gliding filamentous cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We investigate both the colony's transient and steady-state dynamics and find good agreement with experiments. We furthermore show that the Peclet number and aligning interaction strength govern the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns. Although the system is topologically non-trivial, the parallel and perpendicular pair correlation functions provide structural information about the colony, and thus can be used to extract information about the early stages of biofilm formation. Finally, we find that the effects of the filaments' length cannot be reduced to a system of interacting points. Our model proves to reproduce both cyanobacteria colonies and systems of biofilaments where curvature is transported by motility.</description>

      <title>Circuit design in biology and machine learning. I. Random networks and dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A biological circuit is a neural or biochemical cascade, taking inputs and producing outputs. How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction. Overall, many challenges in biology have machine learning analogs, suggesting hypotheses about how biology's circuits are designed.</description>
