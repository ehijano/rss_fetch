      <title>Audio2Rig: Artist-oriented deep learning tool for facial animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating realistic or stylized facial and lip sync animation is a tedious task. It requires lot of time and skills to sync the lips with audio and convey the right emotion to the character's face. To allow animators to spend more time on the artistic and creative part of the animation, we present Audio2Rig: a new deep learning based tool leveraging previously animated sequences of a show, to generate facial and lip sync rig animation from an audio file. Based in Maya, it learns from any production rig without any adjustment and generates high quality and stylized animations which mimic the style of the show. Audio2Rig fits in the animator workflow: since it generates keys on the rig controllers, the animation can be easily retaken. The method is based on 3 neural network modules which can learn an arbitrary number of controllers. Hence, different configurations can be created for specific parts of the face (such as the tongue, lips or eyes). With Audio2Rig, animators can also pick different emotions and adjust their intensities to experiment or customize the output, and have high level controls on the keyframes setting. Our method shows excellent results, generating fine animation details while respecting the show style. Finally, as the training relies on the studio data and is done internally, it ensures data privacy and prevents from copyright infringement.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Blending Method for Implicit Heterogeneous Porous Model Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous structures are materials consisting of minuscule pores, where the microstructure morphology significantly impacts their macroscopic properties.
  Integrating different porous structures through a blending method is indispensable to cater to diverse functional regions in heterogeneous models.
  Previous studies on blending methods for porous structures have mainly focused on controlling the shape of blending regions, yet they have fallen short in effectively addressing topological errors in blended structures.
  This paper introduces a new blending method that successfully addresses this issue.
  Initially, a novel initialization method is proposed, which includes distinct strategies for blending regions of varying complexities.
  Subsequently, we formulate the challenge of eliminating topological errors as an optimization problem based on persistent homology.
  Through iterative updates of control coefficients, this optimization problem is solved to generate a blended porous structure.
  Our approach not only avoids topological errors but also governs the shape and positioning of the blending region while remaining unchanged in the structure outside blending region.
  The experimental outcomes validate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality blended porous structures.
  Furthermore, these results highlight potential applications of our blending method in biomimetics and the design of high-stiffness mechanical heterogeneous models.</description>

      <title>Neural Gaussian Scale-Space Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian scale spaces are a cornerstone of signal representation and processing, with applications in filtering, multiscale analysis, anti-aliasing, and many more. However, obtaining such a scale space is costly and cumbersome, in particular for continuous representations such as neural fields. We present an efficient and lightweight method to learn the fully continuous, anisotropic Gaussian scale space of an arbitrary signal. Based on Fourier feature modulation and Lipschitz bounding, our approach is trained self-supervised, i.e., training does not require any manual filtering. Our neural Gaussian scale-space fields faithfully capture multiscale representations across a broad range of modalities, and support a diverse set of applications. These include images, geometry, light-stage data, texture anti-aliasing, and multiscale optimization.</description>

      <title>Shadows Don't Lie and Lines Can't Bend! Generative Models don't know Projective Geometry...for now</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models can produce impressively realistic images. This paper demonstrates that generated images have geometric features different from those of real images. We build a set of collections of generated images, prequalified to fool simple, signal-based classifiers into believing they are real. We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels, and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image, the second looks at lines detected in the image, and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors, for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images.</description>

      <title>N-Dimensional Gaussians for Fitting of High Dimensional Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the wake of many new ML-inspired approaches for reconstructing and representing high-quality 3D content, recent hybrid and explicitly learned representations exhibit promising performance and quality characteristics. However, their scaling to higher dimensions is challenging, e.g. when accounting for dynamic content with respect to additional parameters such as material properties, illumination, or time. In this paper, we tackle these challenges for an explicit representations based on Gaussian mixture models. With our solutions, we arrive at efficient fitting of compact N-dimensional Gaussian mixtures and enable efficient evaluation at render time: For fast fitting and evaluation, we introduce a high-dimensional culling scheme that efficiently bounds N-D Gaussians, inspired by Locality Sensitive Hashing. For adaptive refinement yet compact representation, we introduce a loss-adaptive density control scheme that incrementally guides the use of additional capacity towards missing details. With these tools we can for the first time represent complex appearance that depends on many input dimensions beyond position or viewing angle within a compact, explicit representation optimized in minutes and rendered in milliseconds.</description>

      <title>ParSEL: Parameterized Shape Editing with Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to edit 3D assets from natural language presents a compelling paradigm to aid in the democratization of 3D content creation. However, while natural language is often effective at communicating general intent, it is poorly suited for specifying precise manipulation. To address this gap, we introduce ParSEL, a system that enables controllable editing of high-quality 3D assets from natural language. Given a segmented 3D mesh and an editing request, ParSEL produces a parameterized editing program. Adjusting the program parameters allows users to explore shape variations with a precise control over the magnitudes of edits. To infer editing programs which align with an input edit request, we leverage the abilities of large-language models (LLMs). However, while we find that LLMs excel at identifying initial edit operations, they often fail to infer complete editing programs, and produce outputs that violate shape semantics. To overcome this issue, we introduce Analytical Edit Propagation (AEP), an algorithm which extends a seed edit with additional operations until a complete editing program has been formed. Unlike prior methods, AEP searches for analytical editing operations compatible with a range of possible user edits through the integration of computer algebra systems for geometric analysis. Experimentally we demonstrate ParSEL's effectiveness in enabling controllable editing of 3D objects through natural language requests over alternative system designs.</description>

      <title>4DHands: Reconstructing Interactive Hands in 4D with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce 4DHands, a robust approach to recovering interactive hand meshes and their relative movement from monocular inputs. Our approach addresses two major limitations of previous methods: lacking a unified solution for handling various hand image inputs and neglecting the positional relationship of two hands within images. To overcome these challenges, we develop a transformer-based architecture with novel tokenization and feature fusion strategies. Specifically, we propose a Relation-aware Two-Hand Tokenization (RAT) method to embed positional relation information into the hand tokens. In this way, our network can handle both single-hand and two-hand inputs and explicitly leverage relative hand positions, facilitating the reconstruction of intricate hand interactions in real-world scenarios. As such tokenization indicates the relative relationship of two hands, it also supports more effective feature fusion. To this end, we further develop a Spatio-temporal Interaction Reasoning (SIR) module to fuse hand tokens in 4D with attention and decode them into 3D hand meshes and relative temporal movements. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmark datasets. The results on in-the-wild videos and real-world scenarios demonstrate the superior performances of our approach for interactive hand reconstruction. More video results can be found on the project page: https://4dhands.github.io.</description>
