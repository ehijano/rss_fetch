      <title>Oscillons and bubbles in $Q$-ball dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in the thin-wall regime, $Q$-ball--anti-$Q$-ball collisions reveal chaotic behaviour. This is explained by the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the internal modes hosted by the $Q$-balls and by the existence of {\it ephemeral} states, that is unstable, sometimes even short-lived, field configurations that appear as intermediate states. The most important examples of such states are the {\it bubble} of the false broken vacuum, which as intermediate states govern the $QQ^*$ annihilation, and the {\it charged oscillons}.
  The usually short-lived bubble can be dynamically temporarily stabilized, which explains their importance in the dynamics of $Q$-balls. This happens due to the excitation of massless Goldstone modes, which, exerting pressure on the bubble boundaries or being trapped as bound modes, prevent the bubble from collapsing.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.</description>
