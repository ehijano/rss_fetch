      <title>Molecular Hydrogen Line Identifications in Solar Flares Observed by IRIS: Lower Atmospheric Structure from Radiometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich spectrum of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission lines is seen in sensitive observations from the far ultraviolet (FUV) channels of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) during flare activity in solar active region NOAA 11861. Based on this observation we have determined 37 new line identifications by comparing synthetic spectra produced using 1D modeling of H$_2$ fluorescence. To avoid misidentification of the H$_2$ lines, we have also compiled a complete list of atomic line identifications for the IRIS FUV bandpasses from previous work. We carry out analysis of the spatially resolved H$_2$ emission that occurs during the flares and find that: (1) in spatially resolved observations the H$_2$ line ratios may show optically thick line formation, contrary to previous results; (2) comparison of the spatial distribution of H$_2$ Doppler velocities with those measured from other species reveals that H$_2$ remote sensing probes an intermediate depth in the atmosphere between the photosphere and chromosphere, consistent with expectations from modeling; (3) the relationship between H$_2$ line intensity and the observed intensity of its exciter is related to the atmospheric stratification; however, (4) H$_2$ fluorescence can sometimes occur in response to radiation from distant sources many Mm away across the solar surface.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulent Kinetic Helicity on Diffusive \b{eta} effect for Large Scale Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a plasma system with kinematic viscosity \(\nu = 0.006\) and magnetic diffusivity \(\eta = 0.006\), driven by helical kinetic energy, to study the dynamics of energy and helicity in magnetic diffusion. Using the numerical data obtained, we explored methods to determine the \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) coefficients that linearize the nonlinear electromotive force (EMF) and the dynamo process. Initially, we applied conventional statistical approaches such as mean-field theory (MFT), direct interaction approximation (DIA), and eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. We then proposed a simpler alternative method using large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data to calculate \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Our findings show that while \(\alpha\) qualitatively aligns with theoretical predictions, \(\beta\) remains negative, indicating an inverse cascade of energy through magnetic diffusion. This deviated from conventional models and was further analyzed using a recursive method in the second moment identity, revealing that small-scale kinetic helicity couples with large-scale current density to transport energy inversely. We validated our method by reproducing the numerically calculated data. The consistency between our method and direct numerical simulations (DNS) suggests that the negative diffusion process in plasma has a physical basis.</description>

      <title>Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars comprise a spectroscopic class characterized by high temperatures (Teff &gt; ~30 kK) and powerful and rapid stellar winds. Hydrogen-rich WR stars represent the most massive stars in existence (M &gt; ~100 Msun), while classical WR stars are hydrogen-depleted, evolved massive stars which probe the final evolutionary stages of massive stars prior to core collapse. They dominate entire stellar populations in terms of radiative and mechanical feedback, and are thought to give rise to powerful transients such as hydrogen-stripped supernovae (type Ibc SNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). In this chapter, we summarize the main observed properties of WR populations in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, and discuss open problems in our understanding of their structure and formation</description>

      <title>Finite-Lens Effect on Self-Lensing in detached White Dwarfs-Main Sequence Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an edge-on and detached binary system, including a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence star (WDMS), when the source star is passing behind the compact companion its light is bent and magnified. Meanwhile, some part of its images' area is obscured by the WD's disk. These two effects occur simultaneously, and the observer receives the stellar light magnified and partially obscured due to the finite-lens size. We study these effects in different WDMS binary systems numerically using inverse-ray-shooting (IRS) and analytically using approximate relations close to reality. For WDMS systems with long orbital periods $\gtrsim 300$ days and $M_{\rm{WD}}\gtrsim 0.2 M_{\sun}$ ($M_{\rm{WD}}$ is the mass of WD), lensing effects dominate the occultations due to finite-lens effects, and for massive WDs with masses higher than solar mass no occultation happens. The occultations dominate self-lensing signals in systems with low-mass WDs($M_{\rm WD}\lesssim 0.2 M_{\sun}$) in close orbits with short orbital periods $T\lesssim 50$ days. The occultation and self-lensing cancel each other out when the WD's radius equals $\sqrt{2}$ times the Einstein radius, regardless of the source radius, which offers a decreasing relation between the orbital periods and WDs' mass. We evaluate the errors in maximum deviations in self-lensing/occultation normalized flux which are made by using its known analytical relation and conclude that these errors could be up to $0.002,~0.08,~0.03$ when the orbital period is $T=30,~100,~300$ days, respectively. The size of stellar companions in WDMSs has a twofold manner as it decreases the depth of self-lensing/occultation signals but enlarges their width.</description>

      <title>Frequency Comb Calibrated Laser Heterodyne Radiometry for Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk-integrated observations of the Sun provide a unique vantage point to explore stellar activity and its effect on measured radial velocities. Here, we report a new approach for disk-integrated solar spectroscopy and evaluate its capabilities for solar radial velocity measurements. Our approach is based on a near-infrared laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) combined with an optical frequency comb calibration, and we show that this combination enables precision, disk-integrated solar spectroscopy with high spectral resolution (~800,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (~2,600), and absolute frequency accuracy. We use the comb-calibrated LHR to record spectra of the solar Fe I 1565 nm transition over a six-week period. We show that our measurements reach sub-meter-per-second radial velocity precision over a single day, and we use daily measurements of the absolute line center to assess the long-term stability of the comb-calibrated LHR approach. We use this long-duration dataset to quantify the principal uncertainty sources that impact the measured radial velocities, and we discuss future modifications that can further improve this approach in studies of stellar variability and its impact on radial velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>Mg ii h&amp;k spectra of an enhanced network region simulated with the MURaM-ChE code. Results using 1.5D synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mg ii h&amp;k lines are key diagnostics of the solar chromosphere. They are sensitive to the temperature, density, and non-thermal velocities in the chromosphere. The average Mg ii h&amp;k line profiles arising from previous 3D chromospheric simulations are too narrow. We study the formation and properties of the Mg ii h&amp;k lines in a model atmosphere. We also compare the average spectrum, peak intensity, and peak separation of Mg ii k with a representative observation taken by IRIS. We use a model based on the recently developed non-equilibrium version of the radiative magneto-hydrodynamics code MURaM, in combination with forward modeling using the radiative transfer code RH1.5D to obtain synthetic spectra. Our model resembles an enhanced network region created by using an evolved MURaM quiet sun simulation and adding a similar imposed large-scale bipolar magnetic field as in the public Bifrost snapshot of a bipolar magnetic feature. The line width and the peak separation of the spatially averaged spectrum of the Mg ii h&amp;k lines from the MURaM simulation are close to a representative observation from the quiet sun which also includes network fields. However, we find the synthesized line width to be still slightly narrower than in the observation. We find that velocities in the chromosphere play a dominant role in the broadening of the spectral lines. While the average synthetic spectrum also shows a good match with the observations in the pseudo continuum between the two emission lines, the peak intensities are higher in the modeled spectrum. This discrepancy may partly be due to the larger magnetic flux density in the simulation than in the considered observations but also due to the 1.5D radiative transfer approximation. Our findings show that strong maximum velocity differences or turbulent velocities in the chromosphere are necessary to reproduce the observed line widths.</description>

      <title>Origins of Very Low Helium Abundance Streams Detected in the Solar Wind Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of helium ($A_{He}$) in the solar wind exhibits variations typically in the range from 2-5% with respect to solar cycle activity and solar wind velocity. However, there are instances where the observed $A_{He}$ is exceptionally low ($&lt;$ 1%). These low-$A_{He}$ occurrences are detected both near the Sun and at 1 AU. The low $A_{He}$ events are generally observed near the heliospheric current sheet. We analyzed 28 low-$A_{He}$ events observed by the Wind spacecraft and 4 by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to understand their origin. In this work, we make use of the ADAPT-WSA model to derive the sources of our events at the base of the solar corona. The modeling suggests that the low-$A_{He}$ events originated from the boundaries of coronal holes, primarily from large quiescent helmet streamers. We argue that the cusp above the core of the streamer can produce such very low helium abundance events. The streamer core serves as an ideal location for gravitational settling to occur as demonstrated by previous models, leading to the release of this plasma through reconnection near the cusp, resulting in low $A_{He}$ events. Furthermore, observations from Ulysses provide direct evidence that these events originated from coronal streamers.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LII: M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- Presumed Identical Twins Appear Fraternal in Variability, Rotation, H$\alpha$, and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the rotation and stellar activity of four fully convective M dwarf `twin' wide binaries. Components in each pair have (1) astrometry confirming they are common-proper-motion binaries, (2) Gaia $BP$, $RP$, and 2MASS $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ magnitudes matching within 0.10 mag, and (3) presumably the same age and composition. We report long-term photometry, rotation periods, multi-epoch H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, X-ray luminosities, time series radial velocities, and speckle observations for all components. Although it might be expected for the twin components to have matching magnetic attributes, this is not the case. Decade-long photometry of GJ 1183 AB indicates consistently higher spot activity on A than B, a trend matched by A appearing 58$\pm$9% stronger in $L_X$ and 26$\pm$9% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average -- this is despite similar rotation periods of A=0.86d and B=0.68d, thereby informing the range in activity for otherwise identical and similarly-rotating M dwarfs. The young $\beta$ Pic Moving Group member 2MA 0201+0117 AB displays a consistently more active B component that is 3.6$\pm$0.5 times stronger in $L_X$ and 52$\pm$19% stronger in H$\alpha$ on average, with distinct rotation at A=6.01d and B=3.30d. Finally, NLTT 44989 AB displays remarkable differences with implications for spindown evolution -- B has sustained H$\alpha$ emission while A shows absorption, and B is $\geq$39$\pm$4 times stronger in $L_X$, presumably stemming from the surprisingly different rotation periods of A=38d and B=6.55d. The last system, KX Com, has an unresolved radial velocity companion, and is therefore not a twin system.</description>

      <title>4D Grid-fitting of UV-optical spectra of massive stars. I. Numerical technique and its associated uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best way to check the validity of our theories (models) is by direct comparison with the experiment (observations). In this study, we address the numerical inaccuracies intrinsic to the process of comparing theory and observations. To achieve this goal, we built 4D spectra grids for Wolf-Rayet stars (WC and WN spectral classes) and Blue Supergiants (BSGs) characterized by low metallicity similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Through rigorous testing on designated `test' models, we demonstrated that the numerical precision of derived stellar parameters (effective temperature, mass-loss rate, luminosity, and wind velocity) is not exceeding 0.05 dex. Moreover, the mean absolute deviation of the numerically derived stellar parameters is consistently below this threshold for objects with both weak (SMC grid) and strong winds (WC and WN grids), even in the presence of Gaussian noise. Furthermore, we explored the influence of unaccounted factors, including variations in the metal abundances, wind acceleration laws, and clumping, on the precision of the derived parameters. We found that the first two factors have the strongest influence on the numerical accuracy of the derived stellar parameters. Variations in abundances predominantly influenced the mass-loss rate for weak-wind scenarios, while effective temperature and luminosity remained robust. We found that the wind acceleration law influence the numerical uncertainty of the derived wind parameters mostly for models with weak winds. Interestingly, different degrees of clumping demonstrated good precision for spectra with strong winds, contrasting with a decrease in the precision for weak-wind cases. We found also that the accuracy of our approach depends on spectral range and the inclusion of ultraviolet spectral range improves the precision of derived parameters, especially for object with weak winds.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts. In this work, we present a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth, focusing on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input features, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for the period 2010 to 2019. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple but robust machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities and effectively aggravates the space weather forecasts in operational settings. We show how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Constraining the overcontact phase in massive binary evolution -- III. Period stability of known B+B and O+B overcontact systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary systems play a crucial role in massive star evolution. Systems composed of B-type and O-type stars are of particular interest due to their potential to lead to very energetic phenomena or the merging of exotic compact objects. We aim to determine the orbital period variations of a sample of B+B and O+B massive overcontact binaries, with the primary objectives of characterizing the evolutionary timescales of these systems and addressing the existing discrepancy between observational data and theoretical predictions derived from population synthesis models. We used Period04 to analyze archival photometric data going back a century for a sample of seven binary systems to measure their orbital periods. We then determine the period variations using a linear fit. We find that the period variation timescales of five truly overcontact binary systems align with the nuclear timescale, in agreement with previous findings for more massive overcontact binaries. Additionally, we noticed a clear distinction between the five systems that had been unambiguously classified as overcontact systems and both SV Cen and VFTS 066, which seem to be evolving on thermal timescales and might be misclassified as overcontact systems. In the case of the five overcontact binaries, our results indicate a noticeable mismatch between the observational data and the theoretical predictions derived from population synthesis models. Furthermore, our results suggest that additional physical mechanisms must be investigated to compare the observed variations more thoroughly with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Observatory Research of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): X-ray Flare Related Phenomena and Multi-epoch Behavior</title>

Abstract: The most powerful stellar flares driven by magnetic energy occur during the early pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. The Orion Nebula represents the nearest region populated by young stars, showing the greatest number of flares accessible to a single pointing of Chandra. This study is part of a multi-observatory project to explore stellar surface magnetic fields (with HET-HPF), particle ejections (VLBA), and disk ionization (ALMA) immediately following the detection of PMS super-flares with Chandra. In December 2023, we successfully conducted such a multi-telescope campaign. Additionally, by analyzing Chandra data from 2003, 2012, and 2016, we examine the multi-epoch behavior of PMS X-ray emission related to PMS magnetic cyclic activity and ubiquitous versus sample-confined mega-flaring. Our findings follow. 1) We report detailed stellar quiescent and flare X-ray properties for numerous HET/ALMA/VLBA targets, facilitating ongoing multi-wavelength analyses. 2) For numerous moderately energetic flares, we report correlations (or lack thereof) between flare energies and stellar mass/size (presence/absence of disks) for the first time. The former is attributed to the correlation between convection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the operation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. 3) We find that most PMS stars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of intrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by saturated PMS X-rays. 4) We conclude that X-ray mega-flares are ubiquitous phenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and nascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle irradiation events.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux of MHD modes in magnetic solar vortex tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows, known as solar vortex tubes, are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport magnetic energy to the upper solar atmosphere. We aim to investigate the Poynting flux associated with these waves within solar vortex tubes. We model a solar vortex tube as a straight magnetic flux tube with a background azimuthal velocity component. The MHD wave solutions in the equilibrium configuration of a vortex tube are obtained using the SESAME code and we derive an expression for the vertical component of the Poynting flux, $S_z$, associated with MHD modes. In addition, we present 2D visualisations of the spatial structure of $S_z$ for different MHD modes under different background flow strengths. We show that $S_z$ increases in the presence of a background rotational flow when compared to a flux tube with no rotational flow. When the strength of the background flow is greater than $100$ times the strength of the perturbation, the $S_z$ associated with non-axisymmetric ($|m|&gt;0$) modes increases by over $1000\%$ when compared to a magnetic flux tube in the absence of a background rotational flow. Furthermore, we present a fundamental property of solar vortices that they cannot solely produce an upwards Poynting flux in an untwisted tube, meaning that any observed $S_z$ in straight flux tubes must arise from perturbations, such as MHD waves.</description>

      <title>High Resolution ALMA Observations of Richly Structured Protoplanetary Disks in $\sigma$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ALMA has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over a hundred au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or arising as a consequence of planet-disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high resolution ($\sim8$ au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in $\sigma$ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semi-major axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in $\sigma$ Orionis are mostly small and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation~($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity~($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>A differentiable N-body code for transit timing and dynamical modelling -- II. Photodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet transits contain substantial information about the architecture of a system. By fitting transit lightcurves we can extract dynamical parameters and place constraints on the properties of the planets and their host star. Having a well-defined probabilistic model plays a crucial role in making robust measurements of these parameters, and the ability to differentiate the model provides access to more robust inference tools. Gradient-based inference methods can allow for more rapid and accurate sampling of high-dimensional parameters spaces. We present a fully differentiable photodynamical model for multi-planet transit lightcurves that display transit-timing variations. We model time-integrated exposures, compute the dynamics of a system over the full length of observations, and provide analytic expressions for derivatives of the flux with respect to the dynamical and photometric model parameters. The model has been implemented in the Julia language and is available open-source on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular cloudS (GEMS). X. Observational effects of turbulence on the chemistry of molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) We explore the chemistry of the most abundant C, O, S, and N bearing species in molecular clouds, in the context of the IRAM 30 m Large Programme Gas phase Elemental abundances in Molecular Clouds (GEMS). In this work, we aim to assess the limitations introduced in the observational works when a uniform density is assumed along the line of sight for fitting the observations, developing a very simple numerical model of a turbulent box. We perform a MHD simulation in order to reproduce the turbulent steady-state of a turbulent box with properties typical of a molecular filament before collapse. We post-process the results of the MHD simulation with a chemical code to predict molecular abundances, and then post-process this cube with a radiative transfer code to create synthetic emission maps for a series of rotational transitions observed during the GEMS project. From the chemical point of view, we find that turbulence produces variations on the predicted abundances, but they are more or less critical depending on the chosen transition and the chemical age. When compared to real observations, the results from the turbulent simulation provides a better fit than when assuming a uniform gas distribution along the line of sight. In the view of our results, we conclude that taking into account turbulence when fitting observations might significantly improve the agreement with model predictions. This is especially important for sulfur bearing species that are very sensitive to the variations of density produced by turbulence at early times (0.1 Myr). The abundance of CO is also quite sensitive to turbulence when considering the evolution beyond a few 0.1 Myr.</description>

      <title>Long-Time 2D Simulations of Fallback Supernovae: A Systematic Investigation of Explosions Dynamics and Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of eight fallback simulations of zero-metallicity progenitors with masses between $60 M_\odot$ and $95 M_\odot$. The simulations are computed in 2D with the general relativistic CoCoNuT-FMT code for the first few seconds after black hole formation, and then mapped to the Newtonian code Prometheus for long-duration simulations beyond shock breakout. All simulations produce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \times 10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7 M_\odot$ to $34.4 M_\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary monotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer edge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating provides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to reach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole formation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately captured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to extrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We also discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback explosions. The enrichment of the ejecta in intermediate mass and iron-group elements varies considerably and is non-neligible for the more powerful explosions. Low-level neutrino emission after black hole formation from these very massive progenitors may be detectable in the case of a Galactic event.</description>

      <title>Dominance of 2-Minute Oscillations near the Alfv\'en Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves, considered one of the primary candidates for heating and accelerating the fast solar wind, are ubiquitous in spacecraft observations, yet their origin remains elusive. In this study, we analyze data from the first 19 encounters of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and report dominance of 2-minute oscillations near the Alfv\'en surface. The frequency-rectified trace magnetic power spectral density (PSD) of these oscillations indicates that the fluctuation energy is concentrated around 2 minutes for the ``youngest'' solar wind. Further analysis using wavelet spectrograms reveals that these oscillations primarily consist of outward-propagating, spherically polarized Alfv\'en wave bursts. Through Doppler analysis, we show that the wave frequency observed in the spacecraft frame can be mapped directly to the launch frequency at the base of the corona, where previous studies have identified a distinct peak around 2 minutes ($\sim 8$ mHz) in the spectrum of swaying motions of coronal structures observed by SDO AIA. These findings strongly suggest that the Alfv\'en waves originate from the solar atmosphere. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the PSD deformation beyond the Alfv\'en surface supports the idea of dynamic formation of the otherwise absent $1/f$ range in the solar wind turbulence spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.</description>

      <title>Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.</description>

      <title>Heavy Elements Abundances Inferred from the First Adiabatic Exponent in the Solar Envelope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first adiabatic exponent profile, noted $\Gamma_1$, computed along adiabatic coordinates $(T, \rho)$ is in the focus of our study. Under conditions of almost fully ionized hydrogen and helium, the $\Gamma_1$ profile is quite sensitive to heavy elements ionization. $\Gamma_1$ decreases in regions where an element is partially ionized. The recent helioseismic structural inversion is obtained with an accuracy better than $10^{-4}$ in the most of the adiabatic convective zone that allows to study ionization variations. The aim is to determine the major heavy elements content in the solar convective zone. The method of our research is synthesis of the $\Gamma_1$ profile which is based on a linear combination of the contributions of individual heavy elements. The idea of the approach was proposed and justified by Baturin et al. (Astron. Astrophys., 660, A125, 2022). We find the best approximation of the inverted profile $\Gamma_1$ adjusting the abundances of major elements (C, N, O, Ne), meanwhile the abundances of elements heavier than neon are fixed. We synthesize the theoretical $\Gamma_1$ profile using the SAHA-S equation of state, and are able to reproduce the inverted profiles with an accuracy of $(1-2)\cdot 10^{-5}$. Total mass fraction of heavy elements found by this method is $Z=0.0148\pm 0.0004$. The oxygen logarithmic abundance is $8.70\pm 0.03$, carbon $8.44\pm 0.04$, nitrogen $8.12\pm 0.08$, and neon $8.17\pm 0.09$.

      <title>Novel scaling laws to derive spatially resolved flare and CME parameters from sun-as-a-star observables</title>

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are often associated with X-ray (SXR) flares powered by magnetic reconnection in the low-corona, while the CME shocks in the upper corona and interplanetary (IP) space accelerate electrons often producing the type-II radio bursts. The CME and the reconnection event are part of the same energy release process as highlighted by the correlation between reconnection flux ($\phi_{rec}$) that quantifies the strength of the released magnetic free energy during SXR flare, and the CME kinetic energy that drives the IP shocks leading to type-II bursts. Unlike the sun, these physical parameters cannot be directly inferred in stellar observations. Hence, scaling laws between unresolved sun-as-a-star observables, namely SXR luminosity ($L_X$) and type-II luminosity ($L_R$), and the physical properties of the associated dynamical events are crucial. Such scaling laws also provide insights into the interconnections between the particle acceleration processes across low-corona to IP space during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II' events. Using long-term solar data in SXR to radio waveband, we derive a scaling law between two novel power metrics for the flare and CME-associated processes. The metrics of 'flare power' ($P_{flare}=\sqrt{L_X\phi_{rec}}$) and 'CME power' ($P_{CME}= \sqrt{L_R {V_{CME}}^2}$), where $V_{CME}$ is the CME speed, scale as $P_{flare}\propto P_{CME}^{0.76 \pm 0.04}$. Besides, $L_X$ and $\phi_{rec}$ show power-law trends with $P_{CME}$ with indices of 1.12$\pm$0.05 and 0.61$\pm$0.05 respectively. These power-laws help infer the spatially resolved physical parameters, $V_{CME}$ and $\phi_{rec}$, from disk-averaged observables, $L_X$ and $L_R$ during solar-stellar 'flare- CME- type-II' events.</description>

      <title>Dust-Evacuated Zones Near Massive Stars: Consequences of Dust Dynamics on Star-forming Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars form within dense cores composed of both gas and dust within molecular clouds. However, despite the crucial role that dust plays in the star formation process, its dynamics is frequently overlooked, with the common assumption being a constant, spatially uniform dust-to-gas ratio and grain size spectrum. In this study, we introduce a set of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star forming molecular clouds from the {\small STARFORGE} project. These simulations expand upon the earlier radiation MHD models, which included cooling, individual star formation, and feedback. Notably, they explicitly address the dynamics of dust grains, considering radiation, drag, and Lorentz forces acting on a diverse size spectrum of live dust grains. We find that once stars exceed a certain mass threshold ($\sim 2 M_{\odot}$), their emitted radiation can evacuate dust grains from their vicinity, giving rise to a dust-suppressed zone of size $\sim 100$ AU. This removal of dust, which interacts with gas through cooling, chemistry, drag, and radiative transfer, alters the gas properties in the region. Commencing during the early accretion stages and preceding the Main-sequence phase, this process results in a mass-dependent depletion in the accreted dust-to-gas (ADG) mass ratio within both the circumstellar disc and the star. We predict massive stars ($\gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$) would exhibit ADG ratios that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of their parent clouds. Consequently, stars, their discs, and circumstellar environments would display notable deviations in the abundances of elements commonly associated with dust grains, such as carbon and oxygen.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. Critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. The critical flyby criterion we derived offers an improvement over the commonly used tidal radius criterion, particularly in high-speed stellar encounters. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 \sim$ 10-20 au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$ Myr pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>The accretion history of the Milky Way IV. Hints of recent star formation in Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15414</link>

Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are known to be dominated by old stellar populations. This has led to the assumption that their gas-rich progenitors lost their gas during their infall in the Milky Way (MW) halo at distant look-back times. Here, we report a discovery of a tiny but robustly detected population of possibly young ($\sim$ 1 Gyr old) and intermediate-mass ($\rm 1.8 M_{\odot} \le M &lt; 3 M_{\odot}$) stars in MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This was established on the basis of their positions in color-magnitude diagrams, after filtering out the bulk of the foreground MW using Gaia DR3 proper motions. We have considered the possibility that this population is made of evolved blue stragglers. For Sculptor, it seems unlikely, because 95.5% of its stars are older than 8 Gyr, leading to masses smaller than 0.9 M$_{\odot}$. This would only allow blue straggler masses of less than 1.8 M$_{\odot}$, which is much lower than what we observed. Alternatively, it would require the merger of three turnoff stars, which appears even more unlikely. On the other hand, the recent Gaia proper motion measurements of MW dwarf galaxies infer their low binding energies and large angular momenta, pointing to a more recent, $\le$ 3 Gyr, infall. Although the nature of the newly discovered stars still needs further confirmation, we find that they are consistent with the recent infall of the dwarf galaxies into the MW halo, when star formation occurred from the ram pressurization of their gas content before its removal by the hot Galactic corona. The abundance of this plausibly young population of stars is similar to the expectations drawn from hydrodynamical simulations. These results point to a novel origin for MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material are potential ways to further test this finding.</description>
