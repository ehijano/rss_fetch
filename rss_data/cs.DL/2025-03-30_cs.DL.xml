      <title>On the Alignment of Post-Publication Reviews &amp; Bibliometric and Altmetric Impact -- A Case Study on Expert Statements from the Science Media Center Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of academic publishing and peer review, this study investigates the relationship between post-publication expert evaluations, their agreement levels, and the subsequent scientific and public recognition of the reviewed research. Using expert statements from the Science Media Center Germany as a dataset, we analyze Research in Context reviews to examine the alignment between qualitative post-publication assessments and bibliometric as well as altmetric indicators. We employ a Large Language Model to translate unstructured expert reviews into a structured rating scheme. Furthermore, we correlate these evaluations with citation counts from the Web of Science and alternative impact metrics such as the Altmetric Attention Score, news mentions, and Mendeley readership statistics from the Altmetric Explorer. We investigate the alignment of positive or critical post-publication reviews and high or low citation or altmetric counts.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary PhDs face barriers to top university placement within their disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research has gained prominence in addressing complex challenges, yet its impact on early academic careers remains unclear. This study examines how interdisciplinarity during doctoral training influences faculty placement at top universities across diverse fields. Analyzing the career trajectories of 32,977 tenure-track faculty members who earned their Ph.D. degrees after 2005 and their initial faculty placement at 355 U.S. universities, we find that faculty newly hired by top-ranked universities tend to be less interdisciplinary in their Ph.D. research, particularly when they obtained Ph.D. from top universities and remain in their Ph.D. research field. Exploring the underlying reasons, we find that at top universities, the existing faculty's research is generally less interdisciplinary, and their academic priorities are more aligned with the Ph.D. research of less interdisciplinary new hires. This preference may disadvantage women Ph.D. graduates' faculty placement, who exhibit higher interdisciplinarity on average. Furthermore, we show that newly hired faculty with greater interdisciplinarity, when placed at top universities, tend to achieve higher long-term research productivity. This suggests a potential loss in knowledge production and innovation if top institutions continue to undervalue interdisciplinary new hires. These findings highlight structural barriers in faculty hiring and raise concerns about the long-term consequences of prioritizing disciplinary specialization over interdisciplinary expertise.</description>

      <title>Historical Ink: Exploring Large Language Models for Irony Detection in 19th-Century Spanish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to enhance datasets and improve irony detection in 19th-century Latin American newspapers. Two strategies were employed to evaluate the efficacy of BERT and GPT-4o models in capturing the subtle nuances nature of irony, through both multi-class and binary classification tasks. First, we implemented dataset enhancements focused on enriching emotional and contextual cues; however, these showed limited impact on historical language analysis. The second strategy, a semi-automated annotation process, effectively addressed class imbalance and augmented the dataset with high-quality annotations. Despite the challenges posed by the complexity of irony, this work contributes to the advancement of sentiment analysis through two key contributions: introducing a new historical Spanish dataset tagged for sentiment analysis and irony detection, and proposing a semi-automated annotation methodology where human expertise is crucial for refining LLMs results, enriched by incorporating historical and cultural contexts as core features.</description>

      <title>Tackling paper mills requires us to prevent future contamination and clean up the past -- the case of the journal Bioengineered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Taylor &amp; Francis journal Bioengineered has been targeted by paper mills. The goal of this study is to identify problematic articles published in Bioengineered during the period 2010 to 2024.
  Methods: Dimensions was used to search for articles that contained the terms mouse OR mice OR rat OR rats in title or abstract, published in Bioengineered between January 1st 2010 to December 31st 2024. All articles were assessed by eye and by using software to detect inappropriate image duplication and manipulation. An article was classified as problematic if it contained inappropriate image duplication or manipulation or had been previously retracted. Problematic articles were reported on PubPeer by the authors, if they had not been reported previously. All included articles were assessed for post-publication editorial decisions.
  Results: We have excluded all articles published in 2024 from further analysis, as these were all retraction notices. We assessed the remaining 878 articles, of which 226 (25.7%) were identified as problematic, of which 35 had been previously retracted. One retracted article was later de-retracted. One article received a correction. None of the included articles received an expression of concern or the Taylor &amp; Francis under investigation pop-up.
  Conclusions: Taylor &amp; Francis lack of editorial action has left the scientific community vulnerable to reading and citing hundreds of problematic articles published in Bioengineered. To uphold scientific integrity, Taylor &amp; Francis should use the findings of this study as a starting point to systematically identify all compromised articles in Bioengineered and take appropriate editorial action.</description>

      <title>DeepInnovation AI: A Global Dataset Mapping the AI innovation from Academic Research to Industrial Patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), mapping innovation patterns and understanding effective technology transfer from research to applications are essential for economic growth. However, existing data infrastructures suffer from fragmentation, incomplete coverage, and insufficient evaluative capacity. Here, we present DeepInnovationAI, a comprehensive global dataset containing three structured files. DeepPatentAI.csv: Contains 2,356,204 patent records with 8 field-specific attributes. DeepDiveAI.csv: Encompasses 3,511,929 academic publications with 13 metadata fields. These two datasets leverage large language models, multilingual text analysis and dual-layer BERT classifiers to accurately identify AI-related content, while utilizing hypergraph analysis to create robust innovation metrics. Additionally, DeepCosineAI.csv: By applying semantic vector proximity analysis, this file presents approximately one hundred million calculated paper-patent similarity pairs to enhance understanding of how theoretical advancements translate into commercial technologies. DeepInnovationAI enables researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to anticipate trends and identify collaboration opportunities. With extensive temporal and geographical scope, it supports detailed analysis of technological development patterns and international competition dynamics, establishing a foundation for modeling AI innovation and technology transfer processes.</description>
