      <title>Enhancing Acoustic-to-Articulatory Speech Inversion by Incorporating Nasality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is produced through the coordination of vocal tract constricting organs: lips, tongue, velum, and glottis. Previous works developed Speech Inversion (SI) systems to recover acoustic-to-articulatory mappings for lip and tongue constrictions, called oral tract variables (TVs), which were later enhanced by including source information (periodic and aperiodic energies, and F0 frequency) as proxies for glottal control. Comparison of the nasometric measures with high-speed nasopharyngoscopy showed that nasalance can serve as ground truth, and that an SI system trained with it reliably recovers velum movement patterns for American English speakers. Here, two SI training approaches are compared: baseline models that estimate oral TVs and nasalance independently, and a synergistic model that combines oral TVs and source features with nasalance. The synergistic model shows relative improvements of 5% in oral TVs estimation and 9% in nasalance estimation compared to the baseline models.</description>

      <title>You Are What You Say: Exploiting Linguistic Content for VoicePrivacy Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets, by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER) of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances, stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Study on Speech Assessment with Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-intrusive assessment of speech quality and intelligibility is essential when clean reference signals are unavailable. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates audio features and visual cues to predict PESQ and STOI scores. It employs a dual-branch architecture, where spectral features are extracted using STFT, and visual embeddings are obtained via a visual encoder. These features are then fused and processed by a CNN-BLSTM with attention, followed by multi-task learning to simultaneously predict PESQ and STOI. Evaluations on the LRS3-TED dataset, augmented with noise from the DEMAND corpus, show that our model outperforms the audio-only baseline. Under seen noise conditions, it improves LCC by 9.61% (0.8397-&gt;0.9205) for PESQ and 11.47% (0.7403-&gt;0.8253) for STOI. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating visual cues in enhancing the accuracy of non-intrusive speech assessment.</description>

      <title>Unmasking real-world audio deepfakes: A data-centric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of real-world deepfakes presents a critical challenge for existing detection systems, which are often evaluated on datasets collected just for scientific purposes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset of real-world audio deepfakes. Our analysis reveals that these real-world examples pose significant challenges, even for the most performant detection models. Rather than increasing model complexity or exhaustively search for a better alternative, in this work we focus on a data-centric paradigm, employing strategies like dataset curation, pruning, and augmentation to improve model robustness and generalization.
  Through these methods, we achieve a 55% relative reduction in EER on the In-the-Wild dataset, reaching an absolute EER of 1.7%, and a 63% reduction on our newly proposed real-world deepfakes dataset, AI4T. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-centric approaches in enhancing deepfake detection for real-world applications.

      <title>Recognizing Every Voice: Towards Inclusive ASR for Rural Bhojpuri Women</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital inclusion remains a challenge for marginalized communities, especially rural women in low-resource language regions like Bhojpuri. Voice-based access to agricultural services, financial transactions, government schemes, and healthcare is vital for their empowerment, yet existing ASR systems for this group remain largely untested. To address this gap, we create SRUTI ,a benchmark consisting of rural Bhojpuri women speakers. Evaluation of current ASR models on SRUTI shows poor performance due to data scarcity, which is difficult to overcome due to social and cultural barriers that hinder large-scale data collection. To overcome this, we propose generating synthetic speech using just 25-30 seconds of audio per speaker from approximately 100 rural women. Augmenting existing datasets with this synthetic data achieves an improvement of 4.7 WER, providing a scalable, minimally intrusive solution to enhance ASR and promote digital inclusion in low-resource language.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Audio-Language Models with LoRA for Precise Temporal Localization of Prolonged Exposure Therapy Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.</description>

      <title>Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.</description>

      <title>PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations. However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase recall.</description>

      <title>Fractional Fourier Sound Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the innovative application of the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) in sound synthesis, highlighting its potential to redefine time-frequency analysis in audio processing. As an extension of the classical Fourier Transform, the FrFT introduces fractional order parameters, enabling a continuous interpolation between time and frequency domains and unlocking unprecedented flexibility in signal manipulation. Crucially, the FrFT also opens the possibility of directly synthesizing sounds in the alpha-domain, providing a unique framework for creating timbral and dynamic characteristics unattainable through conventional methods. This work delves into the mathematical principles of the FrFT, its historical evolution, and its capabilities for synthesizing complex audio textures. Through experimental analyses, we showcase novel sound design techniques, such as alpha-synthesis and alpha-filtering, which leverage the FrFT's time-frequency rotation properties to produce innovative sonic results. The findings affirm the FrFT's value as a transformative tool for composers, sound designers, and researchers seeking to push the boundaries of auditory creativity.</description>

      <title>SimClass: A Classroom Speech Dataset Generated via Game Engine Simulation For Automatic Speech Recognition Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.</description>

      <title>A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training. Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck: generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.</description>

      <title>Ming-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Model for Perception and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</description>

      <title>CoLMbo: Speaker Language Model for Descriptive Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect, gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets, marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.</description>

      <title>OWSM-Biasing: Contextualizing Open Whisper-Style Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition with Dynamic Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models (OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs, even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9 point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by 7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean set.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD + MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Voice Conversion with Factorized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Factorized MKL-VC, a training-free modification for kNN-VC pipeline. In contrast with original pipeline, our algorithm performs high quality any-to-any cross-lingual voice conversion with only 5 second of reference audio. MKL-VC replaces kNN regression with a factorized optimal transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across dimensions, ensuring effective feature transformation. Experiments on LibriSpeech and FLEURS datasets show MKL-VC significantly improves content preservation and robustness with short reference audio, outperforming kNN-VC. MKL-VC achieves performance comparable to FACodec, especially in cross-lingual voice conversion domain.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Linguistic Constraints from External Knowledge Source for Audio-Visual Target Speech Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models (PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show robust performance gains.</description>

      <title>UmbraTTS: Adapting Text-to-Speech to Environmental Contexts with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural, high-quality, environmentally aware audios.</description>

      <title>Listen, Chat, and Remix: Text-Guided Soundscape Remixing for Enhanced Auditory Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In daily life, we encounter a variety of sounds, both desirable and undesirable, with limited control over their presence and volume. Our work introduces "Listen, Chat, and Remix" (LCR), a novel multimodal sound remixer that controls each sound source in a mixture based on user-provided text instructions. LCR distinguishes itself with a user-friendly text interface and its unique ability to remix multiple sound sources simultaneously within a mixture, without needing to separate them. Users input open-vocabulary text prompts, which are interpreted by a large language model to create a semantic filter for remixing the sound mixture. The system then decomposes the mixture into its components, applies the semantic filter, and reassembles filtered components back to the desired output. We developed a 160-hour dataset with over 100k mixtures, including speech and various audio sources, along with text prompts for diverse remixing tasks including extraction, removal, and volume control of single or multiple sources. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in signal quality across all remixing tasks and robust performance in zero-shot scenarios with varying numbers and types of sound sources.

      <title>Channel Adaptation for Speaker Verification Using Optimal Transport with Pseudo Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain gap often degrades the performance of speaker verification (SV) systems when the statistical distributions of training data and real-world test speech are mismatched. Channel variation, a primary factor causing this gap, is less addressed than other issues (e.g., noise). Although various domain adaptation algorithms could be applied to handle this domain gap problem, most algorithms could not take the complex distribution structure in domain alignment with discriminative learning. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, i.e., Joint Partial Optimal Transport with Pseudo Label (JPOT-PL), to alleviate the channel mismatch problem. Leveraging the geometric-aware distance metric of optimal transport in distribution alignment, we further design a pseudo label-based discriminative learning where the pseudo label can be regarded as a new type of soft speaker label derived from the optimal coupling. With the JPOT-PL, we carry out experiments on the SV channel adaptation task with VoxCeleb as the basis corpus. Experiments show our method reduces EER by over 10% compared with several state-of-the-art channel adaptation algorithms.</description>

      <title>ERVQ: Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization with Intra-and-Inter-Codebook Optimization for Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current neural audio codecs typically use residual vector quantization (RVQ) to discretize speech signals. However, they often experience codebook collapse, which reduces the effective codebook size and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce ERVQ, Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization, a novel enhancement strategy for the RVQ framework in neural audio codecs. ERVQ mitigates codebook collapse and boosts codec performance through both intra- and inter-codebook optimization. Intra-codebook optimization incorporates an online clustering strategy and a code balancing loss to ensure balanced and efficient codebook utilization. Inter-codebook optimization improves the diversity of quantized features by minimizing the similarity between successive quantizations. Our experiments show that ERVQ significantly enhances audio codec performance across different models, sampling rates, and bitrates, achieving superior quality and generalization capabilities. It also achieves 100% codebook utilization on one of the most advanced neural audio codecs. Further experiments indicate that audio codecs improved by the ERVQ strategy can improve unified speech-and-text large language models (LLMs). Specifically, there is a notable improvement in the naturalness of generated speech in downstream zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Audio samples are available here.</description>

      <title>Phonology-Guided Speech-to-Speech Translation for African Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.</description>

      <title>Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Vocoder Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, so do the potential threats of misusing synthetic speech signals. This work tackles three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting corresponding to the task of identifying whether synthetic speech signals originate from a specific vocoder (which requires only target vocoder data), (2) model attribution in a closed-world setting that corresponds to selecting the specific model that generated a sample from a given set of models, and (3) distinguishing synthetic from real speech. We show that standardized average residuals between audio signals and their low-pass or EnCodec filtered versions serve as powerful vocoder fingerprints that can be leveraged for all tasks achieving an average AUROC of over 99% on LJSpeech and JSUT in most settings. The accompanying robustness study shows that it is also resilient to noise levels up to a certain degree.</description>

      <title>The trajectoRIR Database: Room Acoustic Recordings Along a Trajectory of Moving Microphones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data availability is essential to develop acoustic signal processing algorithms, especially when it comes to data-driven approaches that demand large and diverse training datasets. For this reason, an increasing number of databases have been published in recent years, including either room impulse responses (RIRs) or audio recordings during motion. In this paper we introduce the trajectoRIR database, an extensive, multi-array collection of both dynamic and stationary acoustic recordings along a controlled trajectory in a room. Specifically, the database features recordings using moving microphones and stationary RIRs spatially sampling the room acoustics along an L-shaped trajectory. This combination makes trajectoRIR unique and applicable in various tasks ranging from sound source localization and tracking to spatially dynamic sound field reconstruction, auralization and system identification. The recording room has a reverberation time of 0.5 seconds, and the three different microphone configurations employed include a dummy head, with additional reference microphones located next to the ears, 3 first-order Ambisonics microphones, two circular arrays of 16 and 4 channels, and a 12-channel linear array. The motion of the microphones was achieved using a robotic cart traversing a 4.62 meter-long rail at three speeds: [0.2, 0.4, 0.8] m/s. Audio signals were reproduced using two stationary loudspeakers. The collected database features 8648 stationary RIRs, as well as perfect sweeps, speech, music, and stationary noise recorded during motion. Python functions are included to access the recorded audio as well as to retrieve geometrical information.</description>

      <title>The Search for Squawk: Agile Modeling in Bioacoustics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03071v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has shown great promise in helping ecologists understand the health of animal populations and ecosystems. However, extracting insights from millions of hours of audio recordings requires the development of specialized recognizers. This is typically a challenging task, necessitating large amounts of training data and machine learning expertise. In this work, we introduce a general, scalable and data-efficient system for developing recognizers for novel bioacoustic problems in under an hour. Our system consists of several key components that tackle problems in previous bioacoustic workflows: 1) highly generalizable acoustic embeddings pre-trained for birdsong classification minimize data hunger; 2) indexed audio search allows the efficient creation of classifier training datasets, and 3) precomputation of embeddings enables an efficient active learning loop, improving classifier quality iteratively with minimal wait time. Ecologists employed our system in three novel case studies: analyzing coral reef health through unidentified sounds; identifying juvenile Hawaiian bird calls to quantify breeding success and improve endangered species monitoring; and Christmas Island bird occupancy modeling. We augment the case studies with simulated experiments which explore the range of design decisions in a structured way and help establish best practices. Altogether these experiments showcase our system's scalability, efficiency, and generalizability, enabling scientists to quickly address new bioacoustic challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deepfake detection has gained significant attention across audio, text, and image modalities, with high accuracy in distinguishing real from fake. However, identifying the exact source--such as the system or model behind a deepfake--remains a less studied problem. In this paper, we take a significant step forward in audio deepfake model attribution or source tracing by proposing a training-free, green AI approach based entirely on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). Leveraging a pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) model, we show that grouping samples from the same generator is straightforward--we obtain an 0.93 F1-score across five deepfake datasets. The method also demonstrates strong out-of-domain (OOD) detection, effectively identifying samples from unseen models at an F1-score of 0.84.
  We further analyse these results in a multi-dimensional approach and provide additional insights. All code and data protocols used in this work are available in our open repository: https://github.com/adrianastan/tada/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world audio often mixes speech and music, yet models typically handle only one domain. This paper introduces a multi-teacher distillation framework that unifies speech and music models into a single one while significantly reducing model size. Our approach leverages the strengths of domain-specific teacher models, such as HuBERT for speech and MERT for music, and explores various strategies to balance both domains. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that our model matches the performance of domain-specific models, showing the effectiveness of cross-domain distillation. Additionally, we conduct few-shot learning experiments, highlighting the need for general models in real-world scenarios where labeled data is limited. Our results show that our model not only performs on par with specialized models but also outperforms them in few-shot scenarios, proving that a cross-domain approach is essential and effective for diverse tasks with limited data.</description>

      <title>Speech Synthesis By Unrolling Diffusion Process using Neural Network Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces UDPNet, a novel architecture designed to accelerate the reverse diffusion process in speech synthesis. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on timestep embeddings and shared network parameters, UDPNet unrolls the reverse diffusion process directly into the network architecture, with successive layers corresponding to equally spaced steps in the diffusion schedule. Each layer progressively refines the noisy input, culminating in a high-fidelity estimation of the original data, \(x_0\). Additionally, we redefine the learning target by predicting latent variables instead of the conventional \(x_0\) or noise \(\epsilon_0\). This shift addresses the common issue of large prediction errors in early denoising stages, effectively reducing speech distortion. Extensive evaluations on single- and multi-speaker datasets demonstrate that UDPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and efficiency, while generalizing effectively to unseen speech. These results position UDPNet as a robust solution for real-time speech synthesis applications. Sample audio is available at https://onexpeters.github.io/UDPNet.</description>

      <title>Annotation-Free MIDI-to-Audio Synthesis via Concatenative Synthesis and Generative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent MIDI-to-audio synthesis methods using deep neural networks have successfully generated high-quality, expressive instrumental tracks. However, these methods require MIDI annotations for supervised training, limiting the diversity of instrument timbres and expression styles in the output. We propose CoSaRef, a MIDI-to-audio synthesis method that does not require MIDI-audio paired datasets. CoSaRef first generates a synthetic audio track using concatenative synthesis based on MIDI input, then refines it with a diffusion-based deep generative model trained on datasets without MIDI annotations. This approach improves the diversity of timbres and expression styles. Additionally, it allows detailed control over timbres and expression through audio sample selection and extra MIDI design, similar to traditional functions in digital audio workstations. Experiments showed that CoSaRef could generate realistic tracks while preserving fine-grained timbre control via one-shot samples. Moreover, despite not being supervised on MIDI annotation, CoSaRef outperformed the state-of-the-art timbre-controllable method based on MIDI supervision in both objective and subjective evaluation.</description>

      <title>AAD-LLM: Neural Attention-Driven Auditory Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

      <title>Weakly Supervised Multiple Instance Learning for Whale Call Detection and Temporal Localization in Long-Duration Passive Acoustic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marine ecosystem monitoring via Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) generates vast data, but deep learning often requires precise annotations and short segments. We introduce DSMIL-LocNet, a Multiple Instance Learning framework for whale call detection and localization using only bag-level labels. Our dual-stream model processes 2-30 minute audio segments, leveraging spectral and temporal features with attention-based instance selection. Tests on Antarctic whale data show longer contexts improve classification (F1: 0.8-0.9) while medium instances ensure localization precision (0.65-0.70). This suggests MIL can enhance scalable marine monitoring. Code: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/DSMIL-Loc</description>

      <title>CASPER: A Large Scale Spontaneous Speech Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our dataset with 100+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions, providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.</description>

      <title>LID Models are Actually Accent Classifiers: Implications and Solutions for LID on Accented Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking. (iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.</description>

      <title>NTPP: Generative Speech Language Modeling for Dual-Channel Spoken Dialogue via Next-Token-Pair Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00975v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>An introduction to pitch strength in contemporary popular music analysis and production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music information retrieval distinguishes between low- and high-level descriptions of music. Current generative AI models rely on text descriptions that are higher level than the controls familiar to studio musicians. Pitch strength, a low-level perceptual parameter of contemporary popular music, may be one feature that could make such AI models more suited to music production. Signal and perceptual analyses suggest that pitch strength (1) varies significantly across and inside songs; (2) contributes to both small- and large-scale structure; (3) contributes to the handling of polyphonic dissonance; and (4) may be a feature of upper harmonics made audible in a perspective of perceptual richness.</description>

      <title>Towards Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency Voice-Controlled Smart Homes: A Proposal for Offline Speech Recognition and IoT Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology, enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues, including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2) designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and energy sustainability.</description>

      <title>Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound, focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.</description>

      <title>Auto-Regressive vs Flow-Matching: a Comparative Study of Modeling Paradigms for Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.
