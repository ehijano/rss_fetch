      <title>Essential self-adjointness of the Laplacian on weighted graphs: harmonic functions, stability, characterizations and capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two characterizations for the essential self-adjointness of the weighted Laplacian on birth-death chains. The first involves the edge weights and vertex measure and is classically known; however, we give another proof using stability results, limit point-limit circle theory and the connection between essential self-adjointness and harmonic functions. The second characterization involves a new notion of capacity. Furthermore, we also analyze the essential self-adjointness of Schr\"odinger operators, use the characterizations for birth-death chains and stability results to characterize essential self-adjointness for star-like graphs, and give some connections to the $\ell^2$-Liouville property.</description>

      <title>Semi-harmonious and harmonious quasi-projection pairs on Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each adjointable idempotent $Q$ on a Hilbert $C^*$-module $H$, a specific projection $m(Q)$ called the matched projection of $Q$ was introduced recently due to the characterization of the minimum value among all the distances from projections to $Q$. Inspired by the relationship between $m(Q)$ and $Q$, another term called the quasi-projection pair $(P,Q)$ was also introduced recently, where $P$ is a projection on $H$ satisfying $Q^*=(2P-I)Q(2P-I)$, in which $Q^*$ is the adjoint operator of the idempotent $Q$ and $I$ is the identity operator on $H$. Some fundamental issues on quasi-projection pairs, such as the block matrix representations for quasi-projection pairs and the $C^*$-morphisms associated with quasi-projection pairs, are worthwhile to be investigated. This paper aims to make some detailed preparations. Two objects called the semi-harmonious quasi-projection pair and the harmonious quasi-projection pair are introduced and are systematically studied in the general setting of the adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules. Some applications concerning the common similarity of operators and a norm equation associated with the Friedrichs angle are also dealt with. Furthermore, many examples are provided to illustrate the non-triviality of the associated characterizations.</description>

      <title>On extremal points for some vectorial total variation seminorms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the set of extremal points of the generalized unit ball induced by gradient total variation seminorms for vector-valued functions on bounded Euclidean domains. These extremal points are central to the understanding of sparse solutions and sparse optimization algorithms for variational regularization problems posed among such functions. For not fully vectorial cases in which either the domain or the target are one dimensional, or the sum of the total variations of each component is used, we prove that these extremals are fully characterized as in the scalar-valued case, that is, they consist of piecewise constant functions with two regions. For definitions involving more involved matrix norms and in particular spectral norms, which are of interest in image processing, we produce families of examples to show that the resulting set of extremal points is larger and includes piecewise constant functions with more than two regions. We also consider the total deformation induced by the symmetrized gradient, for which minimization with linear constraints appears in problems of determination of limit loads in a number of continuum mechanical models involving plasticity, bringing relevance to the corresponding extremal points. For this case, we show piecewise infinitesimally rigid functions with two pieces to be extremal under mild assumptions. Finally, as an example of an extremal which is not piecewise constant, we prove that unit radial vector fields are extremal for the Frobenius total variation in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new condition is introduced by generalizing the Ritt and Kreiss operators named $(\alpha, \beta)$-RK condition. Geometrical properties of the spectrum for the case $\beta &lt; 1$ are studied, moreover it is shown that in that case if $\alpha + \beta = 1$ the operator is Ritt. Estimates for the power and power differences norms for this type of operators are also studied. Lastly we apply this theory to obtain and interpolation result over Ritt and Kreiss operator on $L^p$ spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Maximal Monotone Operators in Hadamard Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, some topics of monotone operator theory in the setting of Hadamard spaces are investigated. For a fixed element $p$ in a Hadamard space $X$, the notion of $p$-Fenchel conjugate is introduced and a type of the Fenchel-Young inequality is proved. Moreover, we examine the $p$-Fitzpatrick transform and its main properties for monotone set-valued operators in Hadamard spaces. Furthermore, some relations between maximal monotone operators and certain classes of proper, convex, l.s.c. extended real-valued functions on $X\times X^{\scalebox{0.7}{$^{\lozenge}$}}$, are given.</description>

Abstract: For a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$ including balls and polydisks we prove the density of their canonical image in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$. This Corona Theorem is proved first in its abstract version for certain uniform algebras. We use properties of bands of measures and idempotents corresponding to Gleason parts.
  The essential tools are properties of hyper-Stonean spaces, normal and Henkin measures, results on weak-star closures of reducing bands of measures and uniform bounds for operators used to solve the Gleason problem concerning generators of the ideal of analytic functions vanishing at a given point.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new variant of the weak optimal transport problem where mass is distributed from one space to the other through unnormalized kernels. We give sufficient conditions for primal attainment and prove a dual formula for this transport problem. We also obtain dual attainment conditions for some specific cost functions. As a byproduct we obtain a transport characterization of the stochastic order defined by convex positively 1-homogenous functions, in the spirit of Strassen theorem for convex domination.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of weighted backward shifts on certain analytic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Banach spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}$ and $c_{0,a,b}$, of analytic functions on the unit disc, having normalized Schauder bases consisting of polynomials of the form $f_n(z)=(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\geq0$, where $\{f_n\}$ is assumed to be equivalent to the standard basis in $\ell^p$ and $c_0$, respectively. We study the weighted backward shift operator $B_w$ on these spaces, and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $B_w$ to be bounded, and prove that, under some mild assumptions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, the operator $B_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a weighted backward shift on the sequence spaces $\ell^p$ or $c_0$. Further, we study the hypercyclicity, mixing, and chaos of $B_w$, and establish the existence of hypercyclic subspaces for $B_w$ by computing its essential spectrum. Similar results are obtained for a function of $B_w$ on $\ell^p_{a,b}$ and $c_{0,a,b}$.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for order continuous Banach lattices with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $X$ is a topological space and $S(X)$ is the vector lattice of all equivalence classes of real-valued continuous functions on open dense subsets of $X$. Although, $S(X)$ is not a normed lattice, we can have unbounded norm topology ($un$-topology) on it. On the other hand, the recent result, due to Wickstead, presents a representation approach for every Archimedean vector lattice $E$ in terms of $S(X)$-spaces. In this paper, we show that this representation is order continuous and when $E$ is order complete, it coincides with the known Maeda-Ogasawara representation. Moreover, we obtain a similar representation for an order continuous Banach lattice in terms of $S(X)$-spaces that is a $un$-homeomorphism. Furthermore, as an application, we establish a representation approach for the Fremlin projective tensor product between Banach lattices, in terms of $S(X)$-spaces, as well.</description>

      <title>Coupled Supersymmetry and Ladder Structures Beyond the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.02767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics has shown that some of the insights based on the algebraic properties of ladder operators related to the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator carry over to the study of more general systems. At this level of generality, pairs of eigenfunctions of so-called partner Hamiltonians are transformed into each other, but the entire spectrum of any one of them cannot be deduced from this intertwining relationship in general -- except in special cases. In this paper, we present a more general structure that provides all eigenvalues for a class of Hamiltonians that do not factor into a pair of operators satisfying canonical commutation relations. Instead of a pair of partner Hamiltonians, we consider two pairs that differ by an overall shift in their spectrum. This is called coupled supersymmetry. In that case, we also develop coherent states and present some uncertainty principles which generalize the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Coupled SUSY is explicitly realized by an infinite family of differential operators which admit orthonormal bases of eigenfunctions of generalized harmonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms of the lattice of slowly oscillating functions on the half-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the space $H(\SO)$ of all homomorphisms of the vector lattice of all slowly oscillating functions on the half-line $\HH=[0,\infty)$. In contrast to the case of homomorphisms of uniformly continuous functions, it is shown that a homomorphism in $H(\SO)$ which maps the unit to zero must be zero-homomorphism. Consequently, we show that the space $H(\SO)$ without zero-homomorphism is homeomorphic to $\HH\times (0, \infty)$. By describing a neighborhood base of zero-homomorphism, we show that $H(\SO)$ is homeomorphic to the space $\HH\times (0, \infty)$ with one point added.</description>

      <title>Sharp extension problem characterizations for higher fractional power operators in Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp characterizations of higher order fractional powers $(-L)^s$, where $s&gt;0$ is noninteger, ofgenerators $L$ of uniformly bounded $C_0$-semigroups on Banach spaces via extension problems, which in particular include results of Caffarelli-Silvestre, Stinga-Torrea and Gal\'e-Miana-Stinga when $0&lt;s&lt;1$. More precisely, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions $U(y)$, $y\geq0$, to initial value problems for both higher order and second order extension problems and characterizations of $(-L)^su$, $s&gt;0$, in terms of boundary derivatives of $U$ at $y=0$, under the sharp hypothesis that $u$ is in the domain of $(-L)^s$. Our results resolve the question of setting up the correct initial conditions that guarantee well-posedness of both extension problems. Furthermore, we discover new explicit subordination formulas for the solution $U$ in terms of the semigroup $\{e^{tL}\}_{t\geq0}$ generated by $L$.</description>

      <title>A unified Fourier slice method to derive ridgelet transform for a variety of depth-2 neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate neural network parameters, it is easier to study the distribution of parameters than to study the parameters in each neuron. The ridgelet transform is a pseudo-inverse operator that maps a given function $f$ to the parameter distribution $\gamma$ so that a network $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]$ reproduces $f$, i.e. $\mathtt{NN}[\gamma]=f$. For depth-2 fully-connected networks on a Euclidean space, the ridgelet transform has been discovered up to the closed-form expression, thus we could describe how the parameters are distributed. However, for a variety of modern neural network architectures, the closed-form expression has not been known. In this paper, we explain a systematic method using Fourier expressions to derive ridgelet transforms for a variety of modern networks such as networks on finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$, group convolutional networks on abstract Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, fully-connected networks on noncompact symmetric spaces $G/K$, and pooling layers, or the $d$-plane ridgelet transform.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analytic approach to exceptional set estimates for orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marstrand's celebrated projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. It is straightforward to see that sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide have no exceptional projections, that is, \emph{all} orthogonal projections satisfy the conclusion of Marstrand's theorem. With this in mind, one might believe that the Fourier dimension (or at least, Fourier decay) could be used to give better estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set in general. We obtain projection theorems and exceptional set estimates based on the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. We apply these results to show that the Fourier spectrum can be used to improve several results for the Hausdorff dimension in certain cases, such as Ren--Wang's sharp bound for the exceptional set in the plane, Peres--Schlag's exceptional set bound and Bourgain--Oberlin's sharp $0$-dimensional exceptional set estimate.</description>
