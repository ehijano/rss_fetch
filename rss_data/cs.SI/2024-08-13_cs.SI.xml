      <title>A Versatile Framework for Attributed Network Clustering via K-Nearest Neighbor Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attributed networks containing entity-specific information in node attributes are ubiquitous in modeling social networks, e-commerce, bioinformatics, etc. Their inherent network topology ranges from simple graphs to hypergraphs with high-order interactions and multiplex graphs with separate layers. An important graph mining task is node clustering, aiming to partition the nodes of an attributed network into k disjoint clusters such that intra-cluster nodes are closely connected and share similar attributes, while inter-cluster nodes are far apart and dissimilar. It is highly challenging to capture multi-hop connections via nodes or attributes for effective clustering on multiple types of attributed networks. In this paper, we first present AHCKA as an efficient approach to attributed hypergraph clustering (AHC). AHCKA includes a carefully-crafted K-nearest neighbor augmentation strategy for the optimized exploitation of attribute information on hypergraphs, a joint hypergraph random walk model to devise an effective AHC objective, and an efficient solver with speedup techniques for the objective optimization. The proposed techniques are extensible to various types of attributed networks, and thus, we develop ANCKA as a versatile attributed network clustering framework, capable of attributed graph clustering (AGC), attributed multiplex graph clustering (AMGC), and AHC. Moreover, we devise ANCKA with algorithmic designs tailored for GPU acceleration to boost efficiency. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare our methods with 19 competitors on 8 attributed hypergraphs, 16 competitors on 6 attributed graphs, and 16 competitors on 3 attributed multiplex graphs, all demonstrating the superb clustering quality and efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>Temporal network modeling with online and hidden vertices based on the birth and death process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks have played an important role in describing real complex systems since the end of the last century. Recently, research on real-world data sets reports intermittent interaction among social individuals. In this paper, we pay attention to this typical phenomenon of intermittent interaction by considering the state transition of network vertices between online and hidden based on the birth and death process. By continuous-time Markov theory, we show that both the number of each vertex's online neighbors and the online network size are stable and follow the homogeneous probability distribution in a similar form, inducing similar statistics as well. In addition, all propositions are verified via simulations. Moreover, we also present the degree distributions based on small-world and scale-free networks and find some regular patterns by simulations. The application in fitting real networks is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the Self-Excited Emotion Dynamics in Online Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions are essential for guiding human behavior, particularly in social interactions. In modern societies, a growing share of human interactions are taking place online which has been shown to amplify and distort the expression and perception of emotions. However, the entanglement across different emotions is not fully understood. We use a multivariate Hawkes self-excited point process to model and calibrate the temporal expressions of six basic emotions in YouTube live chats. This allows us to understand interdependencies among emotions, but also to disentangle the influence from the video content and social interactions with peers. Positive emotions are found to be more contagious, while negative emotions tend to leave a longer-lasting impression on users' memories. Furthermore, we quantify the endogeneity of online emotion dynamics and find that peer interactions drive user emotional expressions 3-5 times more than passive content consumption. This underscores the powerful incentives of social interactions and the potential risk of emotional manipulation through the use of modern chatbots.</description>

      <title>Effect of Perturbation and Topological Structure on Synchronization Dynamics in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way the topological structure transforms from a decoupled to a coupled state in multiplex networks has been extensively studied through both analytical and numerical approaches, often utilizing models of artificial networks. These studies typically assume uniform interconnections between layers to simplify the analytical treatment of structural properties in multiplex networks. However, this assumption is not applicable for real networks, where the heterogeneity of link weights is an intrinsic characteristic. Therefore, in this paper, link weights are calculated considering the node's reputation and the impact of the inter-layer link weights are assessed on the overall network's structural characteristics. These characteristics include synchronization time, stability of synchronization, and the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix (algebraic connectivity). Our findings reveal that the perturbation in link weights (intra-layer) causes a transition in the algebraic connectivity whereas variation in inter-layer link weights has a significant impact on the synchronization stability and synchronization time in the multiplex networks. This analysis is different from the predictions made under the assumption of equal inter-layer link weights.</description>

      <title>Is it a work or leisure travel? Applying text classification to identify work-related travel on social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital era, the use of Social Networks (SNs) and Location-Based SNs (LBSNs) has become integral for travelers seeking Points of Interest (POI) and sharing travel experiences. This trend is supported by the fact that a significant majority of American travelers utilize SNs during their trips. However, the abundance of information available on these platforms presents a challenge in identifying the best options. To address this issue, Recommender Systems (RS) are commonly employed to suggest POIs based on user history, with the integration of contextual information enhancing the quality of recommendations. Notably, incorporating user travel purpose, which is often overlooked but holds potential in characterizing travelers' behavior, can lead to more tailored recommendations. In this study, we propose a model to predict whether a trip is leisure or work-related, utilizing state-of-the-art Automatic Text Classification (ATC) models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and BART to enhance the understanding of user travel purposes and improve recommendation accuracy in specific travel scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study presents a multifaceted approach to enhancing user interaction and content relevance in social media platforms through a federated learning framework. We introduce personalized GPT and Context-based Social Media LLM models, utilizing federated learning for privacy and security. Four client entities receive a base GPT-2 model and locally collected social media data, with federated aggregation ensuring up-to-date model maintenance. Subsequent modules focus on categorizing user posts, computing user persona scores, and identifying relevant posts from friends' lists. A quantifying social engagement approach, coupled with matrix factorization techniques, facilitates personalized content suggestions in real-time. An adaptive feedback loop and readability score algorithm also enhance the quality and relevance of content presented to users. Our system offers a comprehensive solution to content filtering and recommendation, fostering a tailored and engaging social media experience while safeguarding user privacy.</description>

      <title>Improved Adaboost Algorithm for Web Advertisement Click Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an improved Adaboost algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which aims to improve the prediction accuracy of user clicks on web page advertisements. By comparing it with several common machine learning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad click prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is more capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series patterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of the traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its effectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically changing user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate predictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model, this study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two datasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the model has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Structural Feature-Based Approach for Comprehensive Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of graph-structured data across various domains has intensified greater interest in graph classification tasks. While numerous sophisticated graph learning methods have emerged, their complexity often hinders practical implementation. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a method that constructs feature vectors based on fundamental graph structural properties. We demonstrate that these features, despite their simplicity, are powerful enough to capture the intrinsic characteristics of graphs within the same class. We explore the efficacy of our approach using three distinct machine learning methods, highlighting how our feature-based classification leverages the inherent structural similarities of graphs within the same class to achieve accurate classification. A key advantage of our approach is its simplicity, which makes it accessible and adaptable to a broad range of applications, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our method, showing that it not only reveals a competitive performance but in some cases surpasses the accuracy of more complex, state-of-the-art techniques. Our findings suggest that a focus on fundamental graph features can provide a robust and efficient alternative for graph classification, offering significant potential for both research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online user generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Across Platforms and Languages: Dutch Influencers and Legal Disclosures on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content monetization on social media fuels a growing influencer economy. Influencer marketing remains largely undisclosed or inappropriately disclosed on social media. Non-disclosure issues have become a priority for national and supranational authorities worldwide, who are starting to impose increasingly harsher sanctions on them. This paper proposes a transparent methodology for measuring whether and how influencers comply with disclosures based on legal standards. We introduce a novel distinction between disclosures that are legally sufficient (green) and legally insufficient (yellow). We apply this methodology to an original dataset reflecting the content of 150 Dutch influencers publicly registered with the Dutch Media Authority based on recently introduced registration obligations. The dataset consists of 292,315 posts and is multi-language (English and Dutch) and cross-platform (Instagram, YouTube and TikTok). We find that influencer marketing remains generally underdisclosed on social media, and that bigger influencers are not necessarily more compliant with disclosure standards.</description>
