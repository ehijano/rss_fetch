      <title>An Entropy Stable Formulation of Two-equation Turbulence Models with Particular Reference to the k-epsilon Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency and stability are two essential ingredients in the design of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. Robust algorithms can be developed by incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles in their design, such as the entropy production inequality (i.e., the Clausius-Duhem inequality or second law of thermodynamics), rather than by simply adding artificial viscosity (a common approach). This idea is applied to the k-epsilon and two-equation turbulence models by introducing space-time averaging. Then, a set of entropy variables can be defined which leads to a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations. Positivity and symmetry of the equations require certain constraints on the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and the turbulence source terms. With these, we are able to design entropy producing two-equation turbulence models and, in particular, the k-epsilon model.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Stock Prices for Enhanced Multi-Step Forecast and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective stock price forecasting (estimating future prices) and prediction (estimating future price changes) are pivotal for investors, regulatory agencies, and policymakers. These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk management, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their importance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic nature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in distribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting and prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical characteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a log-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and variance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution. Furthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader perspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is much more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term temporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either single-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder (PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model, we utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price changes, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these channels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner. Specifically, the tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning with a channel-mixing encoder to reduce cumulative errors. Comprehensive experiments validate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in forecast and prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Surrogate Modeling Techniques to Predict the Effective Contact Area of Rough Surface Contact Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.</description>

      <title>polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an AI-driven workflow for dynamic x-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under- or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning framework for the mechanical design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.</description>

      <title>Detection, Classification and Prevalence of Self-Admitted Aging Debt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.</description>

      <title>An approach based on metaheuristic algorithms to the timetabling problem in deregulated railway markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical in maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Equitable Rail Service Allocation Through Fairness-Oriented Timetabling in Liberalized Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market, which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway market.</description>
