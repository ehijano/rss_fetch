      <title>Generalized Hilbert-Kunz Multiplicity for Families of Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity for families of ideals in a Noetherian local ring (R,m) of positive characteristic, and introduce a new asymptotic invariant called the Amao-type multiplicity. We establish that, for a p-family of ideals, the generalized Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity arises as the limit of Amao-type multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Initially Cohen-Macaulay Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce initially Cohen-Macaulay modules over a commutative Noetherian local ring $R$, a new class of $R$-modules that generalizes both Cohen-Macaulay and sequentially Cohen-Macaulay modules. A finitely generated $R$-module $N$ is initially Cohen-Macaulay if its depth is equal to its initial dimension, an invariant defined as the infimum of the coheights of the associated primes of $N$. We develop the theory of these modules, providing homological, combinatorial, and topological characterizations and confirming their compatibility with regular sequences, localization, and dimension filtrations. When this theory is applied to simplicial complexes, we establish analogues of Reisner's criterion, the Eagon-Reiner theorem, and Duval's characterization of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes. Finally, we classify certain classes of initially Cohen-Macaulay graphs of interest and those whose projective dimension coincides with their maximum vertex degree.</description>

      <title>Free resolutions and marked families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $A$ a Noetherian $\mathbb{K}$-algebra. In a paper of 2020, M. Albert, C. Bertone, M. Roggero and W. M. Seiler proved that, given a quasi-stable module $U \subset R^m$ with $R=\mathbb{K}[x_0,\dots,x_n]$, any submodule $M\subseteq (R\otimes A)^m$ generated by a marked basis over $U$ admits a special free resolution described in terms of marked bases as well, called the {\em $U$-resolution of $M$}. In this paper, we first investigate the minimality of the $U$-resolution and its structure. When $M$ is an ideal and $A=\mathbb{K}$, we show that $M$ is componentwise linear if and only if its $U$-resolution is minimal, up to a linear change of variables. Then, adopting a functorial approach to the construction of the $U$-resolution, we prove that certain functors naturally associated with the resolution are isomorphic. These isomorphisms arise from the fact that the marked basis of the $i$-th syzygy module in the $U$-resolution can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the marked basis of $M$. Moreover, when $M$ is an ideal of depth at least 2, this correspondence can be reversed: in this case, the marked basis of $M$ itself can be written in terms of the coefficients of the marked basis of its first syzygy module.</description>

      <title>On semi-transitional and transitional rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study two new classes of commutative rings, namely semi transitional rings and transitional rings, which extend several classical ideas arising from rings of continuous functions and their variants. A general framework for these rings is developed through the notion of semi transition and transition maps, leading to a systematic exploration of their algebraic and topological properties. Structural results concerning product rings, localizations, and pm rings are established, showing that these new classes naturally generalize familiar examples such as polynomial rings over fields, rings of bounded continuous functions, and the ring of admissible ideal convergent real sequences. Ideals and filters induced by semi transition maps are analyzed to characterize prime and maximal ideals, revealing a duality between algebraic and set-theoretic constructions. Furthermore, conditions under which semi transitional rings become semiprimitive are determined, and a Stone Cech like compactification is constructed for transitional rings, giving rise to a new perspective on unique extension properties in topological algebra.</description>

      <title>When are splitting loci Gorenstein?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splitting loci are certain natural closed substacks of the stack of vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^1$, which have found interesting applications in the Brill-Noether theory of $k$-gonal curves. In this paper, we completely characterize when splitting loci, as algebraic stacks, are Gorenstein or $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein. The main ingredients of the proof are a computation of the class groups of splitting loci in certain affine extension spaces, and a formula for the class of their canonical module.</description>

      <title>Weak del Pezzo surfaces yield 2-hereditary algebras and 3-Calabi-Yau algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of studying $d$-tilting bundles, which are tilting bundles whose endomorphism algebras have global dimension $d$ (or less), on $d$-dimensional smooth projective varieties has been recognized recently. In Chan's paper, it is conjectured that a smooth projective surface has a $2$-tilting bundle if and only if it is weak del Pezzo. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this endomorphism algebra becomes a $2$-representation infinite algebra whose 3-Calabi-Yau completion gives a non-commutative crepant resolution (NCCR) of the corresponding Du Val del Pezzo cone.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative crepant resolutions of toric singularities with divisor class group of rank one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence and give a classification of toric non-commutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs) of Gorenstein toric singularities with divisor class group of rank one. We prove that they correspond bijectively to non-trivial upper sets in a certain quotient of the divisor class group equipped with a certain partial order. By this classification, we show that for such toric singularities, all toric NCCRs are connected by iterated Iyama-Wemyss mutations.</description>

      <title>Measuring birational derived splinters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with categorical methods for studying singularities. Our focus is on birational derived splinters, which is a notion that extends the definition of rational singularities beyond varieties over fields of characteristic zero. Particularly, we show that an invariant called `level' in the associated derived category measures the failure of these singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Iarrobino's symmetric decomposition for the associated graded algebra of an Artinian Gorenstein algebra to a symmetric decomposition of finite-length self-dual modules over a local algebra, and we deduce consequences for the Hilbert functions of such self-dual modules. We classify the local Hilbert functions for small degree modules. We generalize Kunte's criterion for self-duality in terms of Macaulay's inverse systems.</description>

      <title>Open Neighborhood Ideals of Well Totally Dominated Trees are Cohen-Macaulay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate the open neighborhood ideal $\mathcal{N}(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the minimal primary decomposition of $\mathcal{N}(G)$ in terms of the minimal total dominating sets (TD-sets) of $G$. Then we prove that the open neighborhood ideal of a tree is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if the tree is unmixed (well totally dominated) and calculate the Cohen-Macaulay type. We also give a descriptive characterization of all unmixed trees which takes polynomial time to verify.</description>

      <title>Generalized Additive Decompositions of Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the Generalized Additive Decomposition (GAD) of symmetric tensors, that is, degree-$d$ forms $f \in \mathcal{S}_d$. From a geometric perspective, a GAD corresponds to representing a point on a secant of osculating varieties to the Veronese variety, providing a compact and structured description of a tensor that captures its intrinsic algebraic properties. We provide a linear algebra method for measuring the GAD size and prove that the minimal achievable size, which we call the GAD-rank of the considered tensor, coincides with the rank of suitable Catalecticant matrices, under certain regularity assumptions. We provide a new explicit description of the apolar scheme associated with a GAD as the annihilator of a polynomial-exponential series. We show that if the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of this scheme is sufficiently small, then both the GAD and the associated apolar scheme are minimal and unique. Leveraging these results, we develop a numerical GAD algorithm for symmetric tensors that effectively exploits the underlying algebraic structure, extending existing algebraic approaches based on eigen computation to the treatment of multiple points. We illustrate the effectiveness and numerical stability of such an algorithm through several examples, including Waring and tangential decompositions.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</description>
