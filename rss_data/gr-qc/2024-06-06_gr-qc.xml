      <title>Spinning Proca-Higgs balls, stars and hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spherical and static flat space solitons (balls) and self-gravitating, everywhere regular, asymptotically flat solitons (stars) were constructed in an Einstein-Proca-Higgs model [1], where a complex vector field gains mass by coupling to a real scalar field with a Higgs-type potential. The Proca-Higgs model serves as a UV completion of a complex Proca model with self-interactions. Here, we construct and examine the mathematical and physical properties of rotating configurations. In particular, rotation allows horizon-bearing solutions, including stationary clouds surrounding Kerr black holes and their non-linear continuation into black holes with Proca-Higgs hair.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GW230529: a neutron star merging with a lower mass-gap compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 29 May 2023, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected the gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 from the merger of a neutron star with a lower mass-gap compact object. Its long inspiral signal provides a unique opportunity to test General Relativity (GR) in a parameter space previously unexplored by strong-field tests. In this work, we performed parameterized inspiral tests of GR with GW230529_181500. Specifically, we search for deviations in the frequency-domain GW phase by allowing for agnostic corrections to the post-Newtonian coefficients. We performed tests with the Flexible Theory Independent (FTI) and Test Infrastructure for General Relativity (TIGER) frameworks using several quasi-circular waveform models that capture different physical effects (higher modes, spins, tides). We find that the signal is consistent with GR for all deviation parameters. Assuming the primary object is a black hole, we obtain particularly tight constraints on the dipole radiation at $-1$PN order of $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_{-2}| \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-5}$, which is a factor $\sim17$ times more stringent than previous bounds from the neutron star--black hole merger GW200115_042309, as well as on the 0.5PN and 1PN deviation parameters. We discuss some challenges that arise when analyzing this signal, namely biases due to correlations with tidal effects and the degeneracy between the 0PN deviation parameter and the chirp mass. To illustrate the importance of GW230529_181500 for tests of GR, we mapped the agnostic $-1$PN results to a class of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (ESGB) theories of gravity. We also conducted an analysis probing the specific phase deviation expected in ESGB theory and obtain an upper bound on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling of $\ell_{\rm GB} \lesssim 0.51~\rm{M}_\odot$ ($\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}} \lesssim 0.28$ km), which is better than any previously reported constraint.</description>

      <title>Novel Casimir wormholes in Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of General Relativity (GR), violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is necessary for existence of static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions. Also, it is a well-known fact that the energy conditions are violated by certain quantum fields, such as the Casimir effect. The magnitude and sign of the Casimir energy depend on Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions and geometrical configuration of the objects involved in a Casimir setup. The Casimir energy may act as an ideal candidate for the matter that supports the wormhole geometry. In the present work, we firstly find traversable wormhole solutions supported by a general form for the Casimir energy density assuming a constant redshift function. As well, in this framework, assuming that the radial pressure and energy density obey a linear equation of state, we derive for the first time Casimir traversable wormhole solutions admitting suitable shape function. Then, we consider three geometric configurations of the Casimir effect such as (i) two parallel plates, (ii) two parallel cylindrical shells, and (iii) two spheres. We study wormhole solutions for each case and their property in detail. We also check the weak and strong energy conditions in the spacetime for the obtained wormhole solutions. The stability of the Casimir traversable wormhole solutions are investigated using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. Finally, we study trajectory of null as well as timelike particles in the wormhole spacetime.</description>

      <title>A small cosmological constant from a large number of extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>

      <title>New Taub-NUT Black Holes with Massive Spin-2 Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity extended with quadratic curvature invariants, where the well-known Ricci-flat Taub-NUT black hole remains a solution. An analysis of the unstable Lichnerowicz modes in the Taub-NUT background enables us to identify the mass and NUT parameters (m,n) where new Taub-NUT black holes can emerge. We then adopt numerical technique to construct these new Taub-NUT black holes that bifurcate away from the Ricci-flat ones. Unlike the Ricci-flat Taub-NUT, there can exist two new black holes for an appropriate given temperature, making it a total of three if we include the Ricci-flat one.</description>

      <title>Non-Kerr Constraints using Binary Black Hole inspirals considering phase modifications up to 4 PN order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational field around an astrophysical black hole (BH) is thought to be described by the Kerr spacetime, which is a solution of the Einstein equation. Signatures of binary black hole (BBH) coalescence in gravitational waves (GW) follow the Kerr spacetime as the theoretical foundation. Hence, any possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime around BHs serve as a test of the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime and of the predictions of General Relativity. In our study, we perform a theory-agnostic test of the Kerr hypothesis using BBH inspirals from the third Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). Considering the Johannsen metric, we compute the leading-order deviation to the emitted GW in the frequency domain. Our results provide constraints on two deformation parameters ($\alpha_{13}$ and $\epsilon_3$) and demonstrate the degeneracy between these two non-Kerr parameters.</description>

      <title>A generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the full spacetime metric of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. We examine a previous model of the interior in this approach and show that extending its metric to the full spacetime leads to serious issues in the asymptotic region. To remedy this, we introduce an "improved scheme" mimicking a similar prescription used in loop quantum gravity, where the quantum parameters are made momentum-dependent. Under this scheme, we rework the interior of the black hole and extend it to the full spacetime. We find that the resulting metric is asymptotically flat and its associated Kretschmann scalar is regular everywhere. We also show that the null expansion and Raychaudhuri equation are regular everywhere in this spacetime, implying that the classical singularity is resolved.</description>

      <title>Ringing Thick Braneworld with Finite Extra Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of the Poincar\'e thick brane with a finite extra dimension. Unlike the case with an infinite extra dimension, the gravitational effective potential exhibits three distinct shapes within different ranges of the parameter $n$ in the warp factor: harmonic oscillator potential, P\"oschl-Teller potential, and volcano-like potential. We then study various types of perturbations in this system. Utilizing a combination of analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods, we obtain the quasinormal modes of the perturbed fields. Our findings reveal a set of discrete quasinormal modes for the thick brane, similar to those of black holes. Interestingly, when $n=1$, the quasinormal modes exhibit purely imaginary behavior. This study may provide a new way to detect the existence of extra dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploratory investigation into using Simulation-based Inference techniques, specifically Flow-Matching Posterior Estimation, to construct a posterior density estimator trained using real gravitational-wave detector noise. We use this prototype estimator to investigate possible effects on parameter estimation for Intermediate-Mass Binary Black Holes, showing statistically significant reduced measurement bias. While the results do show potential for improved measurements, they also highlight the need for further work.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gravitational angular momentum and mass dipole losses in the eikonal framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the description of classical gravitational scatterings of two compact objects by means of the eikonal framework. This encodes via scattering amplitudes both the motion of the bodies and the gravitational-wave signals that such systems produce. As an application, we combine the next-to-leading post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform derived in the post-Newtonian (PN) limit with the 4PM static loss due to the linear memory effect to reproduce known results for the total angular mometum loss in the center-of-mass frame up to $\mathcal O(G^4)$ and 2.5PN order. We also provide similar expressions for the change in the system's mass dipole, discussing the subtleties related to its sensitivity to the Coulombic components of the field and to the nonlinear memory effect.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the mysteries of wormhole formation in Rastall-Rainbow gravity: A comprehensive study using the embedding approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work looks for the possible existence of static and spherically symmetric wormhole geometries in Rastall-Rainbow gravity. Since, the Rastall-Rainbow gravity model has been constructed with the combination of Rastall theory and the gravity's rainbow formalism. Taking advantage of the Karmarkar condition for embedding class one metrics, we solve the modified field equations analytically that describe wormholes for specific choice of redshift function. For specific parameter ranges, the solution represents a traversable wormhole that exhibits the violation of null energy condition and consequently the weak energy condition also. Furthermore, we focus on the wormhole stability via adiabatic sound velocity analysis. This model establishes a strong connection between two model parameters, namely, the Rastall parameters and the Rainbow functions, and how it affects the wormhole solution.</description>

      <title>Comparing second-order gravitational self-force and effective-one-body waveforms from inspiralling, quasi-circular black hole binaries with a non-spinning primary and a spinning secondary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comparison of waveforms evaluated using the effective-one-body (EOB) approach and gravitational self-force (GSF) theory for inspiralling black hole binaries with a non-spinning primary and a spinning secondary. This paper belongs to a series of papers comparing the EOB model TEOBResumS to GSF results, where the latter are used to benchmark the EOB analytical choices in the large-mass-ratio regime. In this work, we explore the performance of two gauge choices for the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions GS, GS* entering the spin-orbit sector within the EOB dynamics. In particular, we consider the usual gauge of TEOBResumS, where GS and GS* only depend on the inverse radius and the radial momentum, and a different gauge where these functions also depend on the azimuthal momentum. The latter choice allows us to exploit as prefactor in GS* the complete expression GKS* for a spinning particle on Kerr. As done previously, we employ both waveform alignments in the time domain and a gauge-invariant frequency-domain analysis to gain a more complete understanding of the impact of the new analytical choice. The frequency-domain analysis is particularly useful in confirming that the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions in the new chosen gauge bring the EOB spin contribution at 1st post-adiabatic order closer to the GSF one. We finally implement the improved functions within the public code for TEOBResumS-Dal\'i, which already incorporates eccentricity. In this way, we upgrade the EOB model for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals presented in our previous work.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating in Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for sufficiently large non-minimal coupling ($\xi\gtrsim~\text{few}\times 10$), non-perturbative particle production allows for temperatures of order $10^{12}$ GeV to be reached while also ensuring that the Universe becomes radiation-dominated. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other ad hoc inflaton interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume-averaged pressure inside particles of fixed mass and structure vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. Here we show that this condition is in general not fulfilled in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity, or of other theories of gravity in which the linear momentum is not conserved in this limit (here, $R$ and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively). In particular, we show that dust -- a perfect fluid whose particles are at rest in the fluid's proper frame -- cannot in general be described as pressureless in the context of these theories. We further discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of an ideal gas.</description>

Abstract: GWnext 2024 was a meeting held in the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in March $4^\text{th} - 8^\text{th}$, 2024. In the meeting researchers at different career stages -- with a particular focus on early career scientists -- working on the different aspects of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy gathered to discuss the current status as well as prospects of the field. The meeting was divided into three core sessions: Astrophysics, GW Theory, and Detection. Each session consisted of introductory talks and extended discussion sessions. Moreover, there was a poster session where students could present their results. In this paper, we summarize the results presented during the meeting and present the most important outcomes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $ 3 \times 10 ^{ - 11} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard method used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to explain the amplification of curvature perturbations on small scales arising from the phenomenon of self-resonance. By making a series expansion of the inflationary potential and employing perturbative techniques to solve for the inflaton field, we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation into a Hill equation. Then, we derive expressions for the Floquet exponents corresponding to a potential having both cubic and quartic terms in its expansion. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations. Moreover, we propose potential applications including the generation of Primordial Black Holes, Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves, and Oscillons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study of holographic stress tensor correlators on general Riemann surfaces, extending beyond the previously well-studied torus cases to explore higher genus conformal field theories (CFTs) within the framework of the Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We develop a methodological approach to compute holographic stress tensor correlators, employing the Schottky uniformization technique to address the handlebody solutions for higher genus Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous calculations, we derive four-point stress tensor correlators, alongside recurrence relations for higher-point correlators, within the $\mathrm{AdS}_3/\mathrm{CFT}_2$ context. Additionally, our research delves into the holography of cutoff $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spaces, offering novel insights into the lower-point correlators of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories on higher genus Riemann surfaces up to the first deformation order.</description>

      <title>Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a) \supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge. Our quantum bit thread formulation may provide a way to investigate more fine-grained entanglement structures in general spacetimes.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the absence of echoes in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the analog Hawking radiation for dielectric media, we analyze a toy-model and also the 2D reduction of the Hopfield model for a specific monotone and realistic profile for the refractive index. We are able to provide exact solutions, which do not require any weak dispersion approximation. The theory of Fuchsian ordinary differential equations is the basic tool for recovering exact solutions, which are rigoroulsy identified, and involve the so-called generalized hypergeometric functions $_4F_3(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4;\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3;z)$. A complete set of connection formulas are available, both for the subcritical case and for the transcritical one, and also the Stokes phenomenon occurring in the problem is fully discussed. From the physical point of view, we focus on the problem of thermality. Under suitable conditions, the Hawking temperature is deduced, and we show that it is in fully agreement with the expression deduced in other frameworks under various approximations.</description>

Abstract: The critical gravitational collapse is known to produce continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine all solutions within the complete domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We developed a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings based on quantum perturbation theory to find the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solutions and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

      <title>Black hole interior quantization: a minimal uncertainty approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work we studied the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole implementing an effective minimal length, by applying a modification to the Poisson brackets of the theory. In this work we perform a proper quantization of such a system. Specifically, we quantize the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole in two ways: once by using the standard quantum theory, and once by following a minimal uncertainty approach. Then, we compare the obtained results from the two approaches. We show that, as expected, the wave function in the standard approach diverges in the region where classical singularity is located and the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar also blows up on this state in that region. On the other hand, by following a minimal uncertainty quantization approach, we obtain 5 new and important results as follows. 1) All the interior states remain well-defined and square-integrable. 2) The expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar on the states remains finite over the whole interior region, particularly where used to be the classical singularity, therefore signaling the resolution of the black hole singularity. 3) A new quantum number is found which plays a crucial role in determining the convergence of the norm of states, as well as the convergence and finiteness of the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar. 4) A minimum for the radius of the (2-spheres in the) black holes is found 5) By demanding square-integrability of states in the whole interior region, an exact relation between the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and the minimal uncertainty scale is found.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of 10^-4 by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of departures from classical black hole scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a general investigation into gravitational wave signatures of modifications to scattering of gravitational radiation from black holes. Such modifications may be present due to the quantum dynamics that makes black holes consistent with quantum mechanics, or in other models for departures from classical black hole behavior. We propose a parameterization of the corrections to scattering as a physically meaningful, model-independent, and practical bridge between theoretical and observational aspects of the problem; this parameterization can incorporate different models in the literature. We then describe how these corrections influence the gravitational wave signal, e.g. of a body orbiting a much more massive black hole. In particular, they generically change the rate of energy emission; this effect can be leveraged over many orbits of inspiral to enhance the sensitivity to small corrections, as has been noticed in simple models. We provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these corrections, and outline further work to be done to connect both to a more fundamental theory of quantum black holes, and to realistic observational situations.</description>

      <title>Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+\alpha) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow on the screen decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $\alpha$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical backward ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of black holes in modified gravity, their observational signatures, and constraints.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constant as an integration constant</title>

Abstract: The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider theories in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding the viability of Cotton gravity, and find that while the Codazzi equation is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to $\lambda g_{ab}$ on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without the unimodular constraint.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal Couplings and the Forgotten Field of Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04179</link>

Abstract: We study the multifield dynamics of axion models nonminimally coupled to gravity. As usual, we consider a canonical $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking model in which the axion is the phase of a complex scalar field. If the complex scalar field has a nonminimal coupling to gravity, then the (oft-forgotten) radial component can drive a phase of inflation prior to an inflationary phase driven by the axion field. In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on the radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains extremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field approaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to a second phase of inflation during which the axion field contributes a substantial fraction of the system's total energy density, yielding a phase of "natural inflation." This system exhibits ultra-light isocurvature perturbations, which are converted to adiabatic perturbations by a turning field-space trajectory. For models wherein the CMB pivot scale exited the horizon well before the turn, this acts to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, without generating CMB non-Gaussianity or observable isocurvature perturbations. Finally, we note that for certain parameters the interaction strength between axion and gauge fields can be suppressed during the first phase of inflation relative to its value during the second phase by several orders of magnitude. This decouples the constraints on the inflationary production of gauge fields (e.g., from primordial black holes) from the constraints on their production during (p)reheating.</description>

      <title>Path Integrals from Spacetime Quantum Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05383v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of extending the canonical formulation of quantum mechanics (QM) to a space-time symmetric form has recently attracted wide interest. In this context, a recent proposal has shown that a spacetime symmetric many-body extension of the Page and Wootters mechanism naturally leads to the so-called Quantum Action (QA) operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. In this work, we focus on connecting the QA with the well-established Feynman's Path Integral (PI). In particular, we present a novel formalism which allows one to identify the "sum over histories" with a quantum trace, where the role of the classical action is replaced by the corresponding QA. The trace is defined in the extended Hilbert space resulting from assigning a conventional Hilbert space to each time slice and then taking their tensor product. The formalism opens the way to the application of quantum computation protocols to the evaluation of PIs and general correlation functions, and reveals that different representations of the PI arise from distinct choices of basis in the evaluation of the same trace expression. The Hilbert space embedding of the PIs also discloses a new approach to their continuum time limit. Finally, we discuss how the ensuing canonical-like version of QM inherits many properties from the PI formulation, thus allowing an explicitly covariant treatment of spacetime symmetries.</description>

      <title>Hybrid model of condensate and particle Dark Matter: linear perturbations in the hydrodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse perturbations of self-interacting, scalar field dark matter that contains modes both in a coherent condensate state and an incoherent particle-like state. Starting from the coupled equations for the condensate, the particles' phase space distribution and their mutual gravitational potential, first derived from first principles in earlier work by the authors, we derive a hydrodynamic limit of two coupled fluids and study their linearized density perturbations in an expanding universe, also including particle pressure under an assumption for an equation of state consistent with the dynamical equations. We find that away from the condensate-only or particle-only limits, and for certain ranges of the parameters, such self-interacting mixtures can significantly enhance the density power spectrum above the standard linear $\Lambda$CDM value at localised wavenumbers, even pushing structure formation into the non-linear regime earlier than expected in $\Lambda$CDM for these scales. We also note that such mixtures can lead to degeneracies between models with different boson masses and self-coupling strengths, in particular between self-coupled models and non-coupled Fuzzy Dark Matter made up of heavier bosons. These findings open up the possibility of a richer phenomenology in scalar field dark matter models and could further inform efforts to place observational limits on their parameters.</description>

      <title>Finding origins of CMB anomalies in the inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present compelling evidence for the parity asymmetry (a discrete symmetry that is separate from isotropy) in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map, measured through two-point temperature correlations. This parity asymmetric CMB challenges our understanding of the quantum physics of the early Universe rather than LCDM ($\Lambda$ Cold-Dark-Matter). We commence by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Planck CMB, focusing on the distribution of power in low-multipoles and temperature anticorrelations at parity conjugate points in position space. We find tension with the near scale-invariant power-law power spectrum of Standard Inflation (SI), with p-values of the order $\mathcal{O}\left( 10^{-4}-10^{-3} \right)$. Alternatively, we explore the framework of direct-sum inflation (DSI), where a quantum fluctuation arises as a direct-sum of two components evolving forward and backward in time at parity conjugate points in physical space. We found that DSI is consistent with data on parity asymmetry, the absence of power at $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, and power suppression at low-even-multipoles, which are major data anomalies in the SI. Furthermore, we discover that the parameters characterizing the hemispherical power asymmetry anomaly become statistically insignificant when the large SI quadrupole amplitude is reduced to align with the data. DSI explains this low quadrupole with a p-value of $3.5\%$, 39 times higher than SI. Combining statistics from parameters measuring parity and low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum, we find that DSI is 50-650 times more probable than SI. In summary, our investigation suggests that CMB temperature fluctuations exhibit homogeneity and isotropy but parity-asymmetric consistent with predictions of DSI. This observation provides tantalizing evidence for the quantum mechanical nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Comparison of $\Lambda$CDM and $R_h = ct$ with updated galaxy cluster $f_{gas}$ measurements using Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use updated gas mass fraction measurements of 44 massive dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters collated in arXiv:2111.09343 to distinguish between the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and $R_h=ct$ universe. For this purpose, we use Bayesian model selection to compare the efficacy of both these cosmological models given the data. The gas mass fraction is modeled using both cosmology-dependent terms and also astrophysical parameters, which account for the variation with cluster mass and redshift. We used two different prior choices for some of the astrophysical parameters. We find a Bayes factors of 50 and 5 for $\Lambda$CDM as compared to $R_h=ct$ for these two prior choices. This implies that $\Lambda$CDM is favored compared to $R_h=ct$ with significance ranging from substantial to very strong.</description>

      <title>Central-surface-densities correlation in general MOND theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the foundational axioms of MOND alone predict a strong correlation between a bulk measure of the baryonic surface density, $\Sigma_B$, and the corresponding dynamical one, $\Sigma_D$, of an isolated object, such as a galaxy. The correlation is encapsulated by its high- and low-$\Sigma_B$ behaviors. For $\Sigma_B\gg\Sigma_M\equiv a_0/2\pi G$ ($\Sigma_M$ is the critical MOND surface density) one has $\Sigma_D\approx\Sigma_B$. Their difference -- which would be interpreted as the contribution of dark matter -- is $\Sigma_P=\Sigma_D-\Sigma_B\sim\Sigma_M\ll\Sigma_B$. In the deep-MOND limit, $\Sigma_B\ll\Sigma_M$, one has $\Sigma_D\sim (\Sigma_M\Sigma_B)^{1/2}$. This is a primary prediction of MOND, shared by all theories that embody its basic tenets. Sharper correlations, even strict algebraic relations, $\Sigma_D(\Sigma_B)$, are predicted in specific MOND theories, for specific classes of mass distribution -- e.g., pure discs, or spherical systems -- and for specific definitions of the surface densities. I proceed to discuss such tighter correlations for the central surface densities of axisymmetric galactic systems, $\Sigma^0_B$ and $\Sigma^0_D$. Past work has demonstrated such relations for pure discs in the AQUAL and QUMOND theories. Here I consider them in broader classes of MOND theories. For most observed systems, $\Sigma^0_D$ can not be determined directly at present, but, in many cases, a good proxy for it is the acceleration integral $\mathcal{G}\equiv\int_0^\infty g_r d\ln~r$, where $g_r$ is the radial acceleration along a reflection-symmetry plane of a system, such as a disc galaxy. $\mathcal{G}$ can be determined directly from the rotation curve. I discuss the extent to which $\mathcal{G}$ is a good proxy for $\Sigma^0_D$, and how the relation between them depends on system geometry, from pure discs, through disc-plus-bulge ones, to quasi-spherical systems.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Modeling of Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA's Interferometers and TDI Michelson Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present first-order models for tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in LISA, both for the individual interferometers as well as in the time-delay interferometry (TDI) Michelson observables. These models include the noise contributions from angular and lateral jitter coupling of the six test masses, six movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and three spacecraft. We briefly discuss which terms are considered to be dominant and reduce the TTL model for the second-generation TDI Michelson X observable to these primary noise contributions to estimate the resulting noise level. We show that the expected TTL noise will initially violate the entire mission displacement noise budget, resulting in the known necessity to fit and subtract TTL noise in data post-processing. By comparing the noise levels for different assumptions prior to subtraction, we show why noise mitigation by realignment prior to subtraction is favorable. We then discuss that the TTL coupling in the individual interferometers will have noise contributions that will not be present in the TDI observables. Models for TTL coupling noise in TDI and in the individual interferometers are therefore different, and commonly made assumptions are valid as such only for TDI but not for the individual interferometers. Finally, we analyze what implications can be drawn from the presented models for the subsequent fit-and-subtraction in post-processing. We show that noise contributions from the test mass and inter-satellite interferometers are indistinguishable, such that only the combined coefficients can be fit and used for subtraction. However, a distinction is considered not necessary. Additionally, we show a correlation between coefficients for transmitter and receiver jitter couplings in each individual TDI Michelson observable. This full correlation can be resolved by using all three Michelson observables for fitting the TTL coefficients.</description>

      <title>Dual Inflation and Bounce Cosmologies Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a dual scenario of generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies, producing a scale-invariant curvature perturbation spectrum. Bayesian analysis with pulsar timing array data identifies, for the first time, viable regions from inflation and bounce that simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals and CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor calculations strongly favor this dual scenario over conventional sources and provide initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce regarding SGWB, offering new insights for early universe model-building and future observations.</description>
