      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life, but rather a desire to understand the limits of biology. The Venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the Venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we have tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>How flagellated bacteria wobble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flagellated bacterium navigates fluid environments by rotating its helical flagellar bundle. The wobbling of the bacterial body significantly influences its swimming behavior. To quantify the three underlying motions--precession, nutation, and spin, we extract the Euler angles from trajectories generated by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations, which is experimentally unattainable. In contrast to the common assumption, the cell body does not undergo complete cycles of spin, a general result for multiflagellated bacteria. Our simulations produce apparent wobbling periods that closely match the results of {\it E. coli} obtained from experiments and reveal the presence of two kinds of precession modes, consistent with theoretical analysis. Small-amplitude yet periodic nutation is also observed in the simulations.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>
