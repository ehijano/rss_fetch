      <title>Charmoniumlike Channels $1^{+}$ with Isospin $1$ from Lattice and Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many exotic charmoniumlike mesons have already been discovered experimentally, of which the $Z_c$ mesons with isospin 1 are prominent examples. We investigate $J^{PC}=1^{+\pm}$ states with flavor $\bar cc \bar qq$ ($q=u,d$) in isospin 1 using lattice QCD. This is the first study of these mesons employing more than one volume and involving frames with nonzero total momentum. We utilize two $N_f=2+1$ CLS ensembles with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280\,$MeV. As the simulations are performed with unphysical quark masses and at a single lattice spacing of $a=0.086\,$fm, our results provide only qualitative insights. Resulting eigenenergies are compatible or just slightly shifted down with respect to noninteracting energies, where the most significant shifts occur for certain $D\bar D^*$ states. Both channels $1^{+\pm}$ have a virtual pole slightly below the threshold if $D\bar D^*$ is assumed to be decoupled from other channels. In addition, we perform a coupled channel analysis of $J/\psi \pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ scattering with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ within an effective field theory framework. The $J/\psi \pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ invariant-mass distributions from BESIII and finite-volume energies from several lattice QCD simulations, including this work, are fitted simultaneously. All fits yield two poles relatively close to the $D\bar D^*$ threshold and reasonably reproduce the experimental $Z_c$ peaks. They also reproduce lattice energies up to slightly above the $D\bar{D}^*$ threshold, while reproduction at even higher energies is better for fits that put more weight on the lattice data. Our findings suggest that the employed effective field theory can reasonably reconcile the peaks in the experimental line shapes and the lattice energies, although those lie close to noninteracting energies. We also study $J/\psi \pi$ scattering in s-wave and place upper bounds on the phase shift.</description>

      <title>$SU(2)$ principal chiral model with tensor renormalization group on a cubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the continuous phase transition and thermodynamic observables in the three-dimensional Euclidean $SU(2)$ principal chiral field model with the triad tensor renormalization group (tTRG) and the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG) methods. Using these methods, we find results that are consistent with previous Monte Carlo estimates and the predicted renormalization group scaling of the magnetization close to criticality. These results bring us one step closer to studying finite-density QCD in four dimensions using tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Defect Induced Heavy Meson Dynamics in the QCD Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon introducing an heavy quark in the perturbative regime of the QCD conformal window we precisely determine the associated heavy meson spectrum and wave functions in terms of the number of light flavours and mass. We then compute the conformal Isgur-Wise function which is a central quantity in heavy quark physics. We further determine the impact of the residual low energy confining dynamics on the heavy meson spectrum. As a working framework, we adapt the heavy quark effective theory to the perturbative conformal window dynamics. Our work lays the foundations to systematically go beyond the infinite mass defect approximation in conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Loop unitary and phase band topological invariant in generic multi-band Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>

      <title>New strategies for probing $B\to D^\ast \ell\bar\nu_\ell$ lattice and experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the exclusive semileptonic decay $B\to D^\ast \ell\bar\nu_\ell$ based on the Belle and Belle II data made public in 2023, combined with recent lattice-QCD calculations of the hadronic transition form factors by FNAL/MILC, HPQCD and JLQCD. We also consider a new combination of the Belle and Belle II data sets by HFLAV. The analysis is based on the form-factor parameterisation by Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL), using Bayesian and frequentist statistics, for which we discuss novel strategies. We compare the results of an analysis where the BGL parameterisation is fit only to the lattice data with those from a simultaneous fit to lattice and experiment, and discuss the resulting predictions for the CKM-matrix element $V_{cb}$, as well as other phenomenological observables, such as $R^{\tau/\mu}(D^\ast)$. We find tensions when comparing analyses based on different combinations of experimental or theoretical input, requiring the introduction of a systematic error for some of our results.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quark Momentum Broadening in a Non-Abelian Plasma away from Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform classical-statistical real-time lattice simulations to compute real-time spectral functions and momentum broadening of quarks in the presence of strongly populated non-Abelian gauge fields. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, we find that the momentum distribution of quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features as a function of time due to correlated momentum kicks it receives from the medium, eventually going over to a diffusive regime. We extract the momentum diffusion coefficient for a mass range describing charm and bottom quarks and find sizeable discrepancies from the heavy quark limit.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Computing of Shear Viscosity for $2+1D$ SU(2) Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a nonperturbative calculation of the shear viscosity for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory by using the lattice Hamiltonian formulation. The retarded Green's function of the stress-energy tensor is calculated from real time evolution via exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian with a local Hilbert space truncation, and the shear viscosity is obtained via the Kubo formula. When taking the continuum limit, we account for the renormalization group flow of the coupling but no additional operator renormalization. We find the ratio of the shear viscosity and the entropy density $\frac{\eta}{s}$ is consistent with a well-known holographic result $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ at several temperatures on a $4\times4$ honeycomb lattice with the local electric representation truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. We also find the ratio of the spectral function and frequency $\frac{\rho^{xy}(\omega)}{\omega}$ exhibits a peak structure when the frequency is small.
  Both the exact diagonalization method and simple matrix product state classical simulation method beyond $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$ on bigger lattices require exponentially growing resources. So we develop a quantum computing method to calculate the retarded Green's function and analyze various systematics of the calculation including $j_{\rm max}$ truncation and finite size effects, Trotter errors and the thermal state preparation efficiency. Our thermal state preparation method still requires resources that grow exponentially with the lattice size, but with a very small prefactor at high temperature. We test our quantum circuit on both the Quantinuum emulator and the IBM simulator for a small lattice and obtain results consistent with the classical computing ones.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction matching for solving quantum many-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations play an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions to quantum chemistry and from atomic and molecular systems to nuclear physics. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing a new approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Reduced tensor network formulation for non-Abelian gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor renormalization group computations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for solving functional renormalization group on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing high-dimensional partial differential equations to derive effective actions within the functional renormalization group is formidable, especially when considering various field configurations, including inhomogeneous states, even on lattices. We leverage physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a state-of-the-art machine learning method for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations to overcome this challenge. In a zero-dimensional O($N$) model, we numerically demonstrate the construction of an effective action on an $N$-dimensional configuration space, extending up to $N=100$. Our results underscore the effectiveness of PINN approximation, even in scenarios lacking small parameters such as a small coupling.</description>
