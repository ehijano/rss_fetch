      <title>Winds of change: why binary black hole formation is metallicity dependent, while binary neutron star formation is not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both detailed and rapid population studies alike predict that binary black hole (BHBH) formation is orders of magnitude more efficient at low metallicity than high metallicity, while binary neutron star (NSNS) formation remains mostly flat with metallicity, and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers show intermediate behavior. This finding is a key input to employ double compact objects as tracers of low-metallicity star formation, as spectral sirens, and for merger rate calculations. Yet, the literature offers various (sometimes contradicting) explanations for these trends. We investigate the dominant cause for the metallicity dependence of double compact object formation. We find that the BHBH formation efficiency at low metallicity is set by initial condition distributions, and conventional simulations suggest that about one in eight interacting binary systems with sufficient mass to form black holes will lead to a merging BHBH. We further find that the significance of metallicities in double compact object formation is a question of formation channel. The stable mass transfer and chemically homogeneous evolution channels mainly diminish at high metallicities due to changes in stellar radii, while the common envelope channel is primarily impacted by the combined effects of stellar winds and mass-scaled natal kicks. Outdated giant wind prescriptions exacerbate the latter effect, suggesting BHBH formation may be much less metallicity dependent than previously assumed. NSNS formation efficiency remains metallicity independent as they form exclusively through the common envelope channel, with natal kicks that are uncorrelated with mass. Forthcoming GW observations will provide valuable constraints on these findings</description>

      <title>Luminous Type II Short-Plateau SN 2023ufx: Asymmetric Explosion of a Partially-Stripped Massive Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present supernova (SN) 2023ufx, a unique Type IIP SN with the shortest known plateau duration ($t_\mathrm{PT}$ $\sim$47 days), a luminous V-band peak ($M_{V}$ = $-$18.42 $\pm$ 0.08 mag), and a rapid early decline rate ($s1$ = 3.47 $\pm$ 0.09 mag (50 days)$^{-1}$). By comparing observed photometry to a hydrodynamic MESA+STELLA model grid, we constrain the progenitor to be a massive red supergiant with M$_\mathrm{ZAMS}$ $\simeq$19 - 25 M$_{\odot}$. Independent comparisons with nebular spectral models also suggest an initial He-core mass of $\sim$6 M$_{\odot}$, and thus a massive progenitor. For a Type IIP, SN 2023ufx produced an unusually high amount of nickel ($^{56}$Ni) $\sim$0.14 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_{\odot}$, during the explosion. We find that the short plateau duration in SN 2023ufx can be explained with the presence of a small hydrogen envelope (M$_\mathrm{H_\mathrm{env}}$ $\simeq$1.2 M$_{\odot}$), suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. About $\simeq$0.09 M$_{\odot}$ of CSM through mass loss from late-time stellar evolution of the progenitor is needed to fit the early time ($\lesssim$10 days) pseudo-bolometric light curve. Nebular line diagnostics of broad and multi-peak components of [O I] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6364, H$\alpha$, and [Ca II] $\lambda \lambda$7291, 7323 suggest that the explosion of SN 2023ufx could be inherently asymmetric, preferentially ejecting material along our line-of-sight.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries and Circumstellar Interaction in the Type II SN 2024bch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.9 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H I, He II, C IV, and N IV that disappear by day 6. High cadence photometry from the ground and TESS show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak M$_V \sim$ $-$17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.050 M$_{\odot}$. High-resolution spectra from day 8 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30--40 km s$^{-1}$, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H I and [O I] emission lines seen in the optical and NIR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multi-component H$\alpha$ may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Black Hole by a Strongly Magnetized Thin Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a strong, large-scale magnetic field in an accretion flow leads to extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole (BH) through the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process, believed to power relativistic jets in various astrophysical sources. We study rotational energy extraction from a BH surrounded by a highly magnetized thin disk by performing a set of 3D global GRMHD simulations. We find that the saturated flux threading the BH has a weaker dependence on BH spin, compared to highly magnetized hot (geometrically thick) accretion flows. Also, we find that only a fraction ($10-70$ per cent) of the extracted BZ power is channeled into the jet, depending on the spin parameter. The remaining energy is potentially used to launch winds or contribute to the radiative output of the disk or corona. Our simulations reveal that the presence of a strong magnetic field enhances the radiative efficiency of the disk, making it more luminous than its weakly magnetized counterpart or the standard disk model. We attribute this excess luminosity primarily to the enhanced magnetic dissipation in the intra-ISCO region. Our findings have implications for understanding X-ray corona formation and black hole spin measurements, and interpreting black hole transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dinosaur in a Haystack : X-ray View of the Entrails of SN 2023ixf and the Radio Afterglow of Its Interaction with the Medium Spawned by the Progenitor Star (Paper 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from our extensive hard-to-soft X-ray (NuSTAR, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, Chandra) and meter-to-mm wave radio (GMRT, VLA, NOEMA) monitoring campaign of the very nearby (d $=6.9$ Mpc) Type II SN2023ixf spanning $\approx$ 4--165 d post-explosion. This unprecedented dataset enables inferences on the explosion's circumstellar medium (CSM) density and geometry. Specifically, we find that the luminous X-ray emission is well modeled by thermal free-free radiation from the forward shock with rapidly decreasing photo-electric absorption with time. The radio spectrum is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the same shock, and the NOEMA detection of high-frequency radio emission may indicate a new component consistent with the secondary origin. Similar to the X-rays, the level of free-free absorption affecting the radio spectrum rapidly decreases with time as a consequence of the shock propagation into the dense CSM. While the X-ray and the radio modeling independently support the presence of a dense medium corresponding to an \emph{effective} mass-loss rate $\dot{M} \approx 10^{-4}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at $R = (0.4-14) \times 10^{15}$ (for $v_{\rm w}=\rm 25 \,km\,s^{-1}$), our study points at a complex CSM density structure with asymmetries and clumps. The inferred densities are $\approx$10--100 times those of typical red supergiants, indicating an extreme mass-loss phase of the progenitor in the $\approx$200 years preceding core collapse, which leads to the most X-ray luminous Type II SN and the one with the most delayed emergence of radio emission. These results add to the picture of the complex mass-loss history of massive stars on the verge of collapse and demonstrate the need for panchromatic campaigns to fully map their intricate environments.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength study of 1eRASS J085039.9-421151 with eROSITA NuSTAR and X-shooter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eROSITA instrument on board Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma has completed four scans of the X-ray sky, leading to the detection of almost one million X-ray sources in eRASS1 only, including multiple new X-ray binary candidates. We report on analysis of the X-ray binary 1eRASS J085039.9-421151, using a ~55\,ks long NuSTAR observation, following its detection in each eROSITA scan. Analysis of the eROSITA and NuSTAR X-ray spectra in combination with X-shooter data of the optical counterpart provide evidence of an X-ray binary with a red supergiant (RSG) companion, confirming previous results, although we determine a cooler spectral type of M2-3, owing to the presence of TiO bands in the optical and near infrared spectra. The X-ray spectrum is well-described by an absorbed power law with a high energy cutoff typically applied for accreting high mass X-ray binaries. In addition, we detect a strong fluorescent neutral iron line with an equivalent width of ~700\,eV and an absorption edge, the latter indicating strong absorption by a partial covering component. It is unclear if the partial absorber is ionised. There is no significant evidence of a cyclotron resonant scattering feature. We do not detect any pulsations in the NuSTAR lightcurves, possibly on account of a large spin period that goes undetected due to insufficient statistics at low frequencies or potentially large absorption that causes pulsations to be smeared out. Even so, the low persistent luminosity, the spectral parameters observed (photon index, $\Gamma&lt;1.0$), and the minuscule likelihood of detection of RSG-black hole systems, suggest that the compact object is a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Effects of ultra-fast outflows on X-ray time lags in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time lag between soft and hard X-ray photons has been observed in many active galactic nuclei (AGN) and can reveal the accretion process and geometry around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). High-frequency Fe K and soft lags are considered to originate from the light-travel distances between the corona and the accretion disk, while the propagation of the inward mass accretion fluctuation usually explains the low-frequency hard lags. Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs), with a velocity range of 0.03-0.3c, have also been discovered in numerous AGN and are believed to be launched from the inner accretion disk. However, it remains unclear whether UFOs can affect the X-ray time lags. As a pilot work, we aim to investigate the potential influence of UFOs on X-ray time lags of AGN in a small sample. By performing the UFO-resolved Fourier spectral timing analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations of three AGN with transient UFOs: PG 1448+273, IRAS 13224-3809, and PG 1211+143, we compare their X-ray timing products, such as lag-frequency and lag-energy spectra, of observations with and without UFO obscuration. Our results find that in each AGN, low-frequency hard lags become weak or even disappear when they are accompanied by UFOs. In the high-frequency domain, soft lags remain unchanged while the Fe K reverberation lags tentatively disappear. The comparison between timing products of low- and high-flux observations on another three AGN without UFOs (Ark 564, NGC 7469, and Mrk 335) suggests that the disappearance of low-frequency hard lags is likely related to the emergence of UFOs, not necessarily related to the source flux. We conclude that the presence of UFOs can affect X-ray time lags of AGN by suppressing the low-frequency hard lags, which can be explained by an additional time delay introduced by UFOs or disk accretion energy carried away by UFOs.</description>

      <title>Morphology of 32 Repeating Fast Radio Burst Sources at Microsecond Time Scales with CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) project has discovered the most repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources of any telescope. However, most of the physical conclusions derived from this sample are based on data with a time resolution of $\sim$1 ms. In this work, we present for the first time a morphological analysis of the raw voltage data for 118 bursts from 32 of CHIME/FRB's repeating sources. We do not find any significant correlations amongst fluence, dispersion measure (DM), burst rate, and burst duration. Performing the first large-scale morphological comparison at timescales down to microseconds between our repeating sources and 125 non-repeating FRBs, we find that repeaters are narrower in frequency and broader in duration than non-repeaters, supporting previous findings. However, we find that the duration-normalized sub-burst widths of the two populations are consistent, possibly suggesting a shared physical emission mechanism. Additionally, we find that the spectral fluences of the two are consistent. When combined with the larger bandwidths and previously found larger DMs of non-repeaters, this suggests that non-repeaters may have higher intrinsic specific energies than repeating FRBs. We do not find any consistent increase or decrease in the DM ($\lessapprox 1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$) and scattering timescales ($\lessapprox 2$ ms yr$^{-1}$) of our sources over $\sim2-4$ year periods.</description>

      <title>On the possible core shift break in relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of a jet geometry transition region is an important instrument of assessing the jet ambient medium properties, plasma bulk motion acceleration, parameters of a black hole and location of a jet launching radius. In this work we explore the possibility of a presence of a core shift break, associated with the geometry and jet physical properties transition. We obtain the relations on the core shift offset jump due to a change in a core shift exponent. The condition of a proper frame magnetic field continuity and the core shift break can be used as an instrument to refine the magnetic field estimates upstream the break. This method is applied to the jet in NGC 315. We speculate that the localised in a flow plasma heating either by reconnection or due to particles acceleration at the shock will also lead to a core shift break, but of a different type, than the one observed in NGC 315. We propose to use the multi-frequency core shift measurements to increase the number of sources with a detected jet shape break and to boost the accuracy of assessing the properties of a jet geometry transition region.</description>

      <title>Novel Simulation Framework for Analyzing Cosmic Ray Particle Distributions at a Global Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray measurements have inspired numerous interesting applications over several decades worldwide. These applications encompass non-invasive cosmic ray muon tomography, which enables the imaging of concealed dense objects or structures, the monitoring of area-averaged soil moisture with cosmic ray neutrons in agriculture and climate studies, real-time monitoring of the dynamical changes of the space and earth weather, etc. The demand for a quantitative characterization of cosmic ray shower particles near the Earth's surface is substantial, as it provides realistic particle spectra and rates for these diverse applications. In this study, we introduce Earth Cosmic Ray Shower (ECRS), a GEANT4-based software designed to simulate cosmic ray particle interactions in the atmosphere. ECRS incorporates the U.S. Standard Atmospheric Model and integrates a time-dependent geomagnetic field based on the Tsyganenko and IGRF models. Additionally, we present two case studies illustrating variations in the location-dependent average particle energy for muons, electrons, neutrons, and gammas at sea level. An outlook of this project is provided toward the conclusion.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL search for magnetar giant flares from the Virgo Cluster and in nearby galaxies with high star formation rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant flares from magnetars can reach, for a fraction of a second, luminosities greater than 10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the hard X-ray/soft $\gamma$-ray range. This makes them visible at distances of several megaparsecs. However, at extragalactic distances (farther than the Magellanic Clouds) they are difficult to distinguish from the short $\gamma$-ray bursts, which occur much more frequently. Since magnetars are young neutron stars, nearby galaxies with a high rate of star formation are optimal targets to search for magnetar giant flares (MGFs). Here we report the results of a search for MGFs in observations of the Virgo cluster and in a small sample of nearby galaxies obtained with the IBIS instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite. From the currently known MGF sample we find that their energy distribution is well described by a power law with slope $\gamma$=2 (with 90% c.l. interval [1.7-2.2]). From the lack of detections in this extensive data set (besides 231115A in M82) we derive a 90% c.l. upper limit on the rate of MGF with $E&gt;3\times10^{45}$ erg of $\sim2\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ per magnetar and a lower limit of $R(E)&gt;\sim4\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$ for $E&lt;10^{45}$ erg.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Optical and X-ray Detection of a Thermonuclear Burst in the 2024 Outburst of EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, EXO 0748--676, recently returned to outburst after a $\sim$ 16 year-long quiescence. Since its return, there has been a global effort to capture the previously unseen rise of the source and to understand its somewhat early return to outburst, as it is typical for a source to spend longer in quiescence than in outburst. Here, we report on the simultaneous optical and X-ray detection of a type I X-ray burst, captured by XMM-Newton during a DDT observation on 30th June 2024. The data show 3 X-ray eclipses consistent with the known ephemeris and one type I X-ray burst at 60492.309 MJD. The X-ray burst is reprocessed into the optical band and captured by XMM-Newton's Optical Monitor during a 4399 s exposure with the B filter in image + fast mode. We determine that the optical peak lags the X-ray peak by 4.46 $\pm$ 1.71s. The optical and X-ray rise times are similar, but the optical decay timescale is shorter than the X-ray decay timescale. The reprocessing site is likely within a few light seconds of the X-ray emitting region, so the companion star, accretion disc and ablated material are all plausible.</description>

      <title>Optical evolution of AT 2024wpp: the high-velocity outflows in Cow-like transients are consistent with high spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of optical data of a bright and extremely-rapidly evolving transient, AT2024wpp, whose properties are similar to the enigmatic AT2018cow (aka the Cow). AT2024wpp rose to a peak brightness of c=-21.9mag in 4.3d and remained above the half-maximum brightness for only 6.7d. The blackbody fits to the multi-band photometry show that the event remained persistently hot (T&gt;20000K) with a rapidly receding photosphere (v~11500km/s) until the end of the photometric dataset at +16.1d post-discovery. This behaviour mimics that of AT2018cow, albeit with a several times larger photosphere. The spectra are consistent with blackbody emission throughout our spectral sequence ending at +21.9d, showing a tentative, very broad emission feature at 5500{\AA} -- implying that the optical photosphere is likely within a near-relativistic outflow. Furthermore, reports of strong X-ray and radio emission cement the nature of AT2024wpp as a likely Cow-like transient. AT2024wpp is only the second event of the class with optical polarimetry. Our BVRI observations obtained from +6.1 to +14.4d show a low polarisation of P&lt;0.5% across all bands, similar to AT2018cow that was consistent with P~0% during the same outflow-driven phase. In the absence of evidence for a preferential viewing angle, it is unlikely that both events would have shown low polarisation in the case that their photospheres were aspherical. As such, we conclude that the near-relativistic outflows launched in these events are likely highly spherical, but polarimetric observations of further events are crucial to constrain their ejecta geometry and stratification in detail.</description>

Abstract: This work reviews the current state of the antideuteron ($\bar{d}$) production cross-sections in cosmic ray interactions and its uncertainties, considering the coalescence model and measurements in accelerator experiments. These cross-sections have been included in a simulation of cosmic rays propagation in the Galaxy using GALPROP v.57, with updated parameters of the diffusive reacceleration model. An estimation of the expected antideuteron flux at Earth is presented.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of time-frequency domain gravitational wave signals from binary black holes using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19003v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning techniques have offered an alternative and complementary approach to traditional matched filtering methods for the identification of gravitational wave (GW) signals. The rapid and accurate identification of GW signals is crucial for the progress of GW physics and multi-messenger astronomy, particularly in light of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. In this work, we use the 2D U-Net algorithm to identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers. We simulate BBH mergers with component masses from 5 to 80 $M_{\odot}$ and account for the LIGO detector noise. We find that the GW events in the first and second observation runs could all be clearly and rapidly identified. For the third observing run, about $80\%$ GW events could be identified. In particular, GW190814, currently unknown, is a special case that can be identified by the network, while other binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers can not be identified. Compared to the traditional convolutional neural network, the U-Net algorithm can output the time-frequency domain signal images rather than probabilities, providing a more intuitive investigation. Moreover, some of the results through U-Net can provide preliminary inference on the chirp mass information. In conclusion, the U-Net algorithm can rapidly identify the time-frequency domain GW signals from BBH mergers and potentially be helpful for future parameter inferences.</description>

      <title>Kinematic censorship and high energy particle collisions in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider near-horizon collisions between two particles moving freely in the Schwarzschild metric in the region outside the horizon. One of them emerges from a white hole. We scrutiny when such a process can lead to the indefinitely large growth of the energy in the center of mass frame in the point of collision. We also trace how the kinematics of collision manifests itself in preserving the principle of kinematic censorship according to which the energy released in any event of collision cannot be literally infinite. According to this principle, the energy released in any event of collision, must remain finite although it can be made as large as one likes. Also, we find that particle decay near the singularity leads to unbounded release of energy independently of its initial value.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmology with joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger (MM) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers provide a promising approach to trace the distance-redshift relation, crucial for understanding the expansion history of the Universe and, consequently, testing the nature of Dark Energy (DE). While the gravitational wave (GW) signal offers a direct measure of the distance to the source, high-energy observatories can detect the electromagnetic counterpart and drive the optical follow-up providing the redshift of the host galaxy. In this work, we exploit up-to-date catalogs of $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) supposedly coming from BNS mergers observed by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, to construct a large set of mock MM data. We explore how combinations of current and future generations of GW observatories operating under various underlying cosmological models would be able to detect GW signals from these GRBs. We achieve the reconstruction of the GW parameters by means of a novel prior-informed Fisher matrix approach. We then use these mock data to perform an agnostic reconstruction of the DE phenomenology, thanks to a machine learning method based on forward modeling and Gaussian Processes (GP). Our study highlights the paramount importance of observatories capable of detecting GRBs and identifying their redshift. In the best-case scenario, the GP constraints are 1.5 times more precise than those produced by classical parametrizations of the DE evolution. We show that, in combination with forthcoming cosmological surveys, fewer than 40 GW-GRB detections will enable unprecedented precision on $H_\mathrm{0}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and accurately reconstruct the DE density evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Binary Neutron Stars: Does the Redshift Evolution of the Mass Function Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to detect millions of compact binary mergers across cosmological distances. The features of the mass distribution of these mergers, combined with gravitational wave distance measurements, will enable precise cosmological inferences, even without the need for electromagnetic counterparts. However, achieving accurate results requires modeling the mass spectrum, particularly considering possible redshift evolution. Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are thought to be less influenced by changes in metallicity compared to binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This stability in their mass spectrum over cosmic time reduces the chances of introducing biases in cosmological parameters caused by redshift evolution. In this study, we use the population synthesis code COMPAS to generate astrophysically motivated catalogs of BNS mergers and explore whether assuming a non-evolving BNS mass distribution with redshift could introduce biases in cosmological parameter inference. Our findings demonstrate that, despite large variations in the BNS mass distribution across binary physics assumptions and initial conditions in COMPAS, the mass function remains redshift-independent, allowing a 2% unbiased constraint on the Hubble constant - sufficient to address the Hubble tension. Additionally, we show that in the fiducial COMPAS setup, the bias from a non-evolving BNS mass model is less than 0.5% for the Hubble parameter measured at redshift 0.4. These results establish BNS mergers as strong candidates for spectral siren cosmology in the era of next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Radially-polarized synchrotron from galaxy-cluster virial shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-to-$\gamma$-ray signals, recently found narrowly confined near the characteristic $2.4R_{500}$ scaled radii of galaxy clusters and groups, have been associated with their virial (structure-formation accretion) shocks based on spectro-spatial characteristics. By stacking high-latitude GMIMS radio data around MCXC galaxy clusters, we identify ($3\sigma$-$4\sigma$) excess radially-polarized emission at the exact same scaled radius, providing directional support, and indicating tangential magnetic fields induced by the shocked inflow. The results suggest a strong mass dependence, a flat energy spectrum, and a high polarization fraction, consistent with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by strong virial shocks. The narrow radial range of such stacked virial-shock signals suggests that although the shocks are theorized to have diverse, irregular morphologies, they share similar $\sim 2.4R_{500}$ minimal radii.</description>

      <title>Irregularly Sampled Time Series Interpolation for Detailed Binary Evolution Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of large populations of binary stellar systems is an intergral part of a many areas of astrophysics, from radio pulsars and supernovae to X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational-wave mergers. Binary population synthesis codes that employ self-consistently the most advanced physics treatment available for stellar interiors and their evolution and are at the same time computationally tractable have started to emerge only recently. One element that is still missing from these codes is the ability to generate the complete time evolution of binaries with arbitrary initial conditions using pre-computed three-dimensional grids of binary sequences. Here we present a highly interpretable method, from binary evolution track interpolation. Our method implements simulation generation from irregularly sampled time series. Our results indicate that this method is appropriate for applications within binary population synthesis and computational astrophysics with time-dependent simulations in general. Furthermore we point out and offer solutions to the difficulty surrounding evaluating performance of signals exhibiting extreme morphologies akin to discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and new Variability Structure Functions at the High Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UV-optical variability of quasars appears to depend on black-hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$ through physical timescales in the accretion disc. Here, we calculate mean emission radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm orb}$, of thin accretion disc models as a function of emission wavelength from 1000 to 10000 Angstrom, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx$ const, while towards higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm orb}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the numerical results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm orb}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ in terms of the observables $\lambda$, $M_{\rm BH}$, and the monochromatic luminosity $L_{3000}$. We then calculate variability structure functions for the ~2200 brightest quasars in the sky with estimates for $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{3000}$, using lightcurves from NASA/ATLAS orange passband spanning more than 7 years. The median luminosity of the accretion disc sample is $\log L_{\rm bol}/(\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1})\approx 47$ and the median $\log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\approx 9.35$. At this high mass, the theoretical mass dependence of disc timescales levels off and turns over. The data show a weak dependence of variability on $M_{\rm BH}$ consistent with the turnover and a model where disc timescale drives variability amplitudes in the form $\log A/A_0=1/2\times\Delta t/t_{\rm orb}$, as suggested before. In the future, if the black-hole mass is known, observations of variability might be used as diagnostics of the physical luminosity in accretion discs, and therefore constrain inclination or dust extinction.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the Demographics of Compact Binaries with Merger Entropy Index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescence of binary black holes and neutron stars increases the entropy in the universe. The release of entropy from the inspiral stage to the merger depends primarily on the mass and spin vectors of the compact binary. In this study, we report a novel application of entropy to study the demographics of the compact binaries reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. We compute an astrophysical distribution of the Merger Entropy Index ($\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$) - a mass-independent measure of the efficiency of entropy transfer for black hole binaries - for all the events reported in the LVK Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogs. We derive $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ for six astrophysically motivated population models describing dynamical and isolated formation channels. We find that $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ offers a new criterion to probe the formation channels of LVK events with compact objects in the upper $(\gtrsim 60~M_\odot)$ and lower ($\lesssim 5~M_\odot$) mass-gaps. For GW190521, an event with both objects in the upper mass gap, $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ distribution strongly favors second-generation mergers. For GW230529, a new event with the primary object in the lower mass gap, we note that $\mathcal{I}_\mathrm{BBH}$ mildly favors it with neutron star - black holes events. Our work provides a new framework to study the underlying demographics of compact binaries in the data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Wide Field Monitor (WFM) of the China-Europe eXTP (enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry) mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eXTP mission is a major project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), with a large involvement of Europe. Its scientific payload includes four instruments: SFA, PFA, LAD and WFM. They offer an unprecedented simultaneous wide-band Xray timing and polarimetry sensitivity. A large European consortium is contributing to the eXTP study, both for the science and the instrumentation. Europe is expected to provide two of the four instruments: LAD and WFM; the LAD is led by Italy and the WFM by Spain. The WFM for eXTP is based on the design originally proposed for the LOFT ESA M3 mission, that underwent a Phase A feasibility study. It will be a wide field of view X-ray monitor instrument working in the 2-50 keV energy range, achieved with large-area Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs), similar to the ones used for the LAD but with better spatial resolution. The WFM will consist of 3 pairs of coded mask cameras with a total combined field of view (FoV) of 90x180 degrees at zero response and a source localisation accuracy of ~1 arc min. The main goal of the WFM is to provide triggers for the target of opportunity observations of the SFA, PFA and LAD, in order to perform the core science programme, dedicated to the study of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and magnetism. In addition, the unprecedented combination of large field of view and imaging capability, down to 2 keV, of the WFM will allow eXTP to make important discoveries of the variable and transient X-ray sky, and provide X-ray coverage of a broad range of astrophysical objects covered under 'observatory science', such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, gravitational wave electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper we provide an overview of the WFM instrument, explaining its design, configuration, and anticipated performance.</description>

      <title>GWtuna: Trawling through the data to find Gravitational Waves with Optuna and Jax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GWtuna is a fast gravitational-wave search prototype built on Optuna (optimisation software library) and JAX (accelerator-orientated array computation library) [1, 2]. Using Optuna, we introduce black box optimisation algorithms and evolutionary strategy algorithms to the gravitational-wave community. Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) have been used to create the first template bank free search and used to identify binary neutron star mergers. TPE can identify a binary neutron star merger in 1 second (median value) and less than 1000 matched-filter evaluations when 512 seconds of data is searched over. A stopping algorithm is used to curtail the TPE search if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold has been reached, or the SNR has not improved in 500 evaluations. If the SNR threshold is surpassed, CMA-ES is used to recover the SNR and the template parameters in 9,000 matched filter iterations taking 48 seconds (median value). GWtuna showcases alternatives to the standard template bank search and therefore has the potential to revolutionise the future of gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect in the stationary cylinder with a radial heat flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conducting cylinder with a uniform magnetic field along its axis and radial temperature gradient is considered at the stationary state. At large temperature gradients the azimuthal Hall electrical current creates the axial magnetic field which strength may be comparable with the original one. It is shown, that the magnetic field, generated by the azimuthal Hall current, leads to the decrease of magnetic field originated by external sources, and this suppression increases with increase of the electromotive force, connected with a thermodiffusion. Obtained results can help to investigate influence of the Hall current on the coupled magneto-thermal evolution of magnetic and electric fields in neutron stars, white dwarfs, and, possibly, in a laboratory facilities.</description>

      <title>A fast radio burst localized at detection to an edge-on galaxy using very-long-baseline interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration, luminous radio transients of extragalactic origin. These events have been used to trace the baryonic structure of the Universe using their dispersion measure (DM) assuming that the contribution from host galaxies can be reliably estimated. However, contributions from the immediate environment of an FRB may dominate the observed DM, thus making redshift estimates challenging without a robust host galaxy association. Furthermore, while at least one Galactic burst has been associated with a magnetar, other localized FRBs argue against magnetars as the sole progenitor model. Precise localization within the host galaxy can discriminate between progenitor models, a major goal of the field. Until now, localizations on this spatial scale have only been carried out in follow-up observations of repeating sources. Here we demonstrate the localization of FRB 20210603A with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) on two baselines, using data collected only at the time of detection. We localize the burst to SDSS J004105.82+211331.9, an edge-on galaxy at $z\approx 0.177$, and detect recent star formation in the kiloparsec-scale vicinity of the burst. The edge-on inclination of the host galaxy allows for a unique comparison between the line of sight towards the FRB and lines of sight towards known Galactic pulsars. The DM, Faraday rotation measure (RM), and scattering suggest a progenitor coincident with the host galactic plane, strengthening the link between the environment of FRB 20210603A and the disk of its host galaxy. Single-pulse VLBI localizations of FRBs to within their host galaxies, following the one presented here, will further constrain the origins and host environments of one-off FRBs.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. Importantly, where the radio emission emanates from in the polar cap region is still uncertain.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades in a charge-limited flow from the star surface.
  We find that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases with increasing distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure; rather, the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.</description>

      <title>The large-scale anisotropy and flux (de-)magnification of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the arrival direction distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with a new suite of models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), assuming sources follow the large-scale structure of the Universe. Compared to previous GMF models, the amplitude of the dipole component of the UHECR arrival flux is significantly reduced. We find that the reduction is due to the accidentally coinciding position of the peak of the extragalactic UHECR flux and the boundary of strong flux demagnification due to the GMF toward the central region of the Galaxy. This serendipitous sensitivity of UHECR anisotropies to the GMF model will be a powerful probe of the source distribution as well as Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields. Demagnification by the GMF also impacts visibility of some popular source candidates.</description>

      <title>Broad-band X-ray spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during the 2023 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the broadband spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J17498$-$2921 during its April 2023 outburst using data from NICER (1$-$10 keV), NuSTAR (3$-$79 keV), Insight-HXMT (2$-$150 keV), and INTEGRAL (30$-$150 keV). We detect significant 401 Hz pulsations across the 0.5$-$150 keV band. The pulse fraction increases from $\sim$2% at 1 keV to $\sim$13% at 66 keV. Five type-I X-ray bursts have been detected, including three photospheric radius expansion bursts, with a rise time of $\sim$2 s and an exponential decay time of $\sim$5 s. The recurrence time is $\sim$9.1 h, which can be explained by unstable thermonuclear burning of hydrogen-deficient material on the neutron star surface. The quasi-simultaneous 1$-$150 keV broadband spectra from NICER, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL can be well fitted by an absorbed reflection model, relxillCp, and a Gaussian line of instrumental origin. The Comptonized emission from the hot corona is characterized by a photon index $\Gamma$ of $\sim$1.8 and an electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ of $\sim$40 keV. We obtain a low inclination angle $i\sim34^{\circ}$. The accretion disk shows properties of strong ionization, $\log(\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})\sim4.5$, over-solar abundance, $A_{\rm Fe}\sim 7.7$, and high density, $\log(n_{\rm e}/{\rm cm^{-3}})\sim 19.5$. However, a lower disk density with normal abundance and ionization could also be possible. From the inner disk radius $R_{\rm in}=1.67R_{\rm ISCO}$ and the long-term spin-down rate of $-3.1(2)\times10^{-15}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$, we constrain the magnetic field of IGR J17498$-$2921 in the range of $(0.9-2.4)\times10^8$ G.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the effects of pulse shape changes on pulsar timing precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements of pulses from pulsars are conventionally made by a template matching algorithm that compares a profile constructed by averaging a finite number of pulses to a long-term average pulse shape. However, the shapes of pulses can and do vary, leading to errors in TOA estimation. All pulsars show stochastic variations in shape, amplitude, and phase between successive pulses that only partially average out in averages of finitely many pulses. This jitter phenomenon will only become more problematic for timing precision as more sensitive telescopes are built. We describe techniques for characterizing jitter (and other shape variations) and demonstrate them with data from the Vela pulsar, PSR B0833$-$45. These include partial sum analyses; auto-and cross correlations between templates and profiles and between multifrequency arrival times; and principal component analysis. We then quantify how pulse shape changes affect TOA estimates using both analytical and simulation methods on pulse shapes of varying complexity (multiple components). These methods can provide the means for improving arrival time precision for many applications, including gravitational wave astronomy using pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Connecting dust and outflows in AGN: the intriguing case of NGC 6860</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic dust plays a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies, significantly influencing star formation and the interstellar medium. However, in active galactic nuclei (AGN), the role and origin of dust remain poorly understood. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in AGN. NGC 6860, an X-ray bright type-1 quasar, is an ideal target for investigating the connection between dust and winds in AGN. It exhibits reddening and X-ray absorption by both dust and winds. By modeling high-resolution X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we determine the properties of dust and outflows in this AGN. Our analysis finds four photoionized components, outflowing with velocities of 50-300 km/s. The first two are relatively highly ionized with logxi = 3.4 and logxi = 2.9. The results of our photoionization modeling suggest that these two components are thermally unstable. The third component is ionized, with logxi = 2.3 and is located further away from the central black hole. The fourth component is less ionized, and is possibly located in the host galaxy. The application of dust models enables us to probe the abundance and location of the dust in NGC 6860. Our findings suggest that dust absorption and reddening originates from the extended narrow-line region and its host galaxy.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the blackbody radiation problem in the presence of quantum gravity effects encoded in modified dispersion relations. The spectral radiance and the generalized Stefan-Boltzmann law are studied in this context. Furthermore, the regime of low temperatures is also contemplated, where features related to the blackbody thermal laws and the thermodynamic quantities such as energy, pressure, entropy, and specific heat are obtained. Possible implications in compact objects such as neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>ExaGRyPE: Numerical General Relativity Solvers Based upon the Hyperbolic PDEs Solver Engine ExaHyPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ExaGRyPE describes a suite of solvers for numerical relativity, based upon ExaHyPE 2, the second generation of our Exascale Hyperbolic PDE Engine. The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.</description>

      <title>Does the Amati Correlation Exhibit Redshift-Driven Heterogeneity in Long GRBs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer significant insights into cosmology due to their high energy emissions and the potential to probe the early universe. The Amati relation, which links the intrinsic peak energy to the isotropic energy, is crucial for understanding their cosmological applications. This study investigates the redshift-driven heterogeneity of the Amati correlation in long GRBs. Analyzing 221 long GRBs with redshifts from 0.034 to 8.2 we divided the dataset based on redshift thresholds of 1.5 and 2. Using Bayesian marginalization and Reichart's likelihood approach, we found significant differences in the Amati parameters between low and high redshift subgroups. These variations, differing by approximately $2\sigma$ at $z = 1.5$ and more than $1\sigma$ at $z = 2$, suggest an evolution in the GRB population with redshift, possibly reflecting changes in host galaxy properties. However, selection effects and instrumental biases may also contribute. Our results challenge the assumption of the Amati relation's universality and underscore the need for larger datasets and more precise measurements from upcoming missions like Transient High-Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS) and enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP) to refine our understanding of GRB physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics content of the QGSJET-III Monte Carlo model of high energy hadronic interactions is briefly described. The predictions of the model for extensive air shower characteristics are presented in comparison to the corresponding results of other Monte Carlo generators of cosmic ray interactions. The results of a recent quantitative analysis of uncertainties for such predictions are discussed, notably, regarding possibilities to enhance the muon content of extensive air showers or to delay the air shower development.</description>
