      <title>Asymptotic Inapproximability of Reconfiguration Problems: Maxmin $k$-Cut and Maxmin E$k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hardness of approximating two reconfiguration problems. One problem is Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration, which is a reconfiguration analogue of Max $k$-Cut. The other is Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration, which is a reconfiguration analogue of Max E$k$-SAT. The Probabilistically Checkable Reconfiguration Proof theorem due to Hirahara and Ohsaka (STOC 2024) and Karthik C. S. and Manurangsi (2023) implies that Maxmin 4-Cut Reconfiguration and Maxmin E3-SAT Reconfiguration are PSPACE-hard to approximate within a constant factor. However, the asymptotic behavior of approximability for these problems with respect to $k$ is not well understood.
  In this paper, we present the following hardness-of-approximation results and approximation algorithms for Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration and Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration:
  $\bullet$ For every $k \geq 2$, Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard to approximate within a factor of $1 - \Omega\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$, whereas it can be approximated within a factor of $1-\frac{2}{k}$. Our lower and upper bounds demonstrate that Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration exhibits the asymptotically same approximability as Max $k$-Cut.
  $\bullet$ For every $k \geq 3$, Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration is PSPACE-hard (resp. NP-hard) to approximate within a factor of $1-\Omega\left(\frac{1}{9^{\sqrt{k}}}\right)$ (resp. $1-\frac{1}{8k}$). On the other hand, it admits a deterministic $\left(1-\frac{2.5}{k}\right)$-factor approximation algorithm, implying that Maxmin E$k$-SAT Reconfiguration displays an asymptotically approximation threshold different from Max E$k$-SAT.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Expressive Power of Weisfeiler-Leman: A Homomorphism Counting Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to count homomorphisms has recently been proposed as a practical and fine-grained measure of their expressive power. Although several existing works have investigated the homomorphism counting power of certain GNN families, a simple and unified framework for analyzing the problem is absent. In this paper, we first propose \emph{generalized folklore Weisfeiler-Leman (GFWL)} algorithms as a flexible design basis for expressive GNNs, and then provide a theoretical framework to algorithmically determine the homomorphism counting power of an arbitrary class of GNN within the GFWL design space. As the considered design space is large enough to accommodate almost all known powerful GNNs, our result greatly extends all existing works, and may find its application in the automation of GNN model design.</description>

      <title>The 1/3-conjectures for domination in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set S of vertices in a graph G is a dominating set of G if every vertex not in S is adjacent to a vertex in S . The domination number of G, denoted by $\gamma$(G), is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set in G. In a breakthrough paper in 2008, L{\"o}wenstein and Rautenbach proved that if G is a cubic graph of order n and girth at least 83, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$ n/3. A natural question is if this girth condition can be lowered. The question gave birth to two 1/3-conjectures for domination in cubic graphs. The first conjecture, posed by Verstraete in 2010, states that if G is a cubic graph on n vertices with girth at least 6, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$ n/3. The second conjecture, first posed as a question by Kostochka in 2009, states that if G is a cubic, bipartite graph of order n, then $\gamma$(G) $\le$n/3. In this paper, we prove Verstraete's conjecture when there is no 7-cycle and no 8-cycle, and we prove the Kostochka's related conjecture for bipartite graphs when there is no 4-cycle and no 8-cycle.</description>

      <title>Finding connected components of a graph using traversals associated with iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve many problems on graphs, graph traversals are used, the usual variants of which are the depth-first search and the breadth-first search. Implementing a graph traversal we consequently reach all vertices of the graph that belong to a connected component. The breadth-first search is the usual choice when constructing efficient algorithms for finding connected components of a graph. Methods of simple iteration for solving systems of linear equations with modified graph adjacency matrices and with the properly specified right-hand side can be considered as graph traversal algorithms. These traversal algorithms, generally speaking, turn out to be non-equivalent neither to the depth-first search nor the breadth-first search. The example of such a traversal algorithm is the one associated with the Gauss-Seidel method. For an arbitrary connected graph, to visit all its vertices, the algorithm requires not more iterations than that is required for BFS. For a large number of instances of the problem, fewer iterations will be required.</description>

      <title>Weakly and Strongly Aperiodic Subshifts of Finite Type on Baumslag-Solitar Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.02534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the periodicity of subshifts of finite type (SFT) on Baumslag-Solitar groups. We show that for residually finite Baumslag-Solitar groups there exist both strongly and weakly-but-not-strongly aperiodic SFTs. In particular, this shows that unlike $\mathbb{Z}^2$, but like $\mathbb{Z}^3$, strong and weak aperiodic SFTs are different classes of SFTs in residually finite BS groups. More precisely, we prove that a weakly aperiodic SFT on BS(m,n) due to Aubrun and Kari is, in fact, strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and weakly but not strongly aperiodic on any other BS(m,n). In addition, we exhibit an SFT which is weakly but not strongly aperiodic on BS(1,n); and we show that there exists a strongly aperiodic SFT on BS(n,n).</description>

      <title>Six Permutation Patterns Force Quasirandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A sequence $\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots$ of permutations is said to be "quasirandom" if the induced density of every permutation $\sigma$ in $\pi_n$ converges to $1/|\sigma|!$ as $n\to\infty$. We prove that $\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots$ is quasirandom if and only if the density of each permutation $\sigma$ in the set $$\{123,321,2143,3412,2413,3142\}$$ converges to $1/|\sigma|!$. Previously, the smallest cardinality of a set with this property, called a "quasirandom-forcing" set, was known to be between four and eight. In fact, we show that there is a single linear expression of the densities of the six permutations in this set which forces quasirandomness and show that this is best possible in the sense that there is no shorter linear expression of permutation densities with positive coefficients with this property. In the language of theoretical statistics, this expression provides a new nonparametric independence test for bivariate continuous distributions related to Spearman's $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the natural connection between quantum walks and electrical networks by considering Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop the multidimensional electrical network by defining Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law based on the novel multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. This multidimensional electrical network allows us to sample from the electrical flow obtained via a multidimensional quantum walk algorithm and achieve exponential quantum-classical separations for certain graph problems.
  We first use this framework to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the well known exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree problem by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis. Furthermore, by constructing a $3$-regular graph based on welded trees, this framework also allows us to show an exponential speedup for the pathfinding problem. This solves one of the open problems by Li [arXiv '23], where they construct a non-regular graph and use the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.
  In analogy to the connection between the (edge-vertex) incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we also rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law. By establishing this connection, we expect that the multidimensional electrical network could have more applications beyond quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Local certification of forbidden subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting specific structures in a network has been a very active theme of research in distributed computing for at least a decade. In this paper, we start the study of subgraph detection from the perspective of local certification. Remember that a local certification is a distributed mechanism enabling the nodes of a network to check the correctness of the current configuration, thanks to small pieces of information called certificates. Our main question is: For a given graph $H$, what is the minimum certificate size that allows checking that the network does not contain $H$ as a (possibly induced) subgraph?
  We show a variety of lower and upper bounds, uncovering an interesting interplay between the optimal certificate size, the size of the forbidden subgraph, and the locality of the verification. Along the way we introduce several new technical tools, in particular what we call the \emph{layered map}, which is not specific to forbidden subgraphs and that we expect to be useful for certifying many other properties.</description>
