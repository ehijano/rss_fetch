      <title>ProgrammableGrass: A Shape-Changing Artificial Grass Display Adapted for Dynamic and Interactive Display Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various proposals for employing grass materials as a green landscape-friendly display. However, it is difficult for current techniques to display smooth animations using 8-bit images and to adjust display resolution, similar to conventional displays. We present ProgrammableGrass, an artificial grass display with scalable resolution, capable of swiftly controlling grass color at 8-bit levels. This grass display can control grass colors linearly at the 8-bit level, similar to an LCD display, and can also display not only 8-bit-based images but also videos. This display enables pixel-by-pixel color transitions from yellow to green using fixed-length yellow and adjustable-length green grass. We designed a grass module that can be connected to other modules. Utilizing a proportional derivative control, the grass colors are manipulated to display animations at approximately 10 [fps]. Since the relationship between grass lengths and colors is nonlinear, we developed a calibration system for ProgrammableGrass. We revealed that this calibration system allows ProgrammableGrass to linearly control grass colors at 8-bit levels through experiments under multiple conditions. Lastly, we demonstrate ProgrammableGrass to show smooth animations with 8-bit grayscale images. Moreover, we show several application examples to illustrate the potential of ProgrammableGrass. With the advancement of this technology, users will be able to treat grass as a green-based interactive display device.</description>

      <title>A Physics-embedded Deep Learning Framework for Cloth Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delicate cloth simulations have long been desired in computer graphics. Various methods were proposed to improve engaged force interactions, collision handling, and numerical integrations. Deep learning has the potential to achieve fast and real-time simulation, but common neural network structures often demand many parameters to capture cloth dynamics. This paper proposes a physics-embedded learning framework that directly encodes physical features of cloth simulation. The convolutional neural network is used to represent spatial correlations of the mass-spring system, after which three branches are designed to learn linear, nonlinear, and time derivate features of cloth physics. The framework can also integrate with other external forces and collision handling through either traditional simulators or sub neural networks. The model is tested across different cloth animation cases, without training with new data. Agreement with baselines and predictive realism successfully validate its generalization ability. Inference efficiency of the proposed model also defeats traditional physics simulation. This framework is also designed to easily integrate with other visual refinement techniques like wrinkle carving, which leaves significant chances to incorporate prevailing macing learning techniques in 3D cloth amination.</description>

      <title>FLex: Joint Pose and Dynamic Radiance Fields Optimization for Stereo Endoscopic Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction of endoscopic scenes is an important asset for various medical applications, from post-surgery analysis to educational training. Neural rendering has recently shown promising results in endoscopic reconstruction with deforming tissue. However, the setup has been restricted to a static endoscope, limited deformation, or required an external tracking device to retrieve camera pose information of the endoscopic camera. With FLex we adress the challenging setup of a moving endoscope within a highly dynamic environment of deforming tissue. We propose an implicit scene separation into multiple overlapping 4D neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and a progressive optimization scheme jointly optimizing for reconstruction and camera poses from scratch. This improves the ease-of-use and allows to scale reconstruction capabilities in time to process surgical videos of 5,000 frames and more; an improvement of more than ten times compared to the state of the art while being agnostic to external tracking information. Extensive evaluations on the StereoMIS dataset show that FLex significantly improves the quality of novel view synthesis while maintaining competitive pose accuracy.</description>

      <title>WHAC: World-grounded Humans and Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating human and camera trajectories with accurate scale in the world coordinate system from a monocular video is a highly desirable yet challenging and ill-posed problem. In this study, we aim to recover expressive parametric human models (i.e., SMPL-X) and corresponding camera poses jointly, by leveraging the synergy between three critical players: the world, the human, and the camera. Our approach is founded on two key observations. Firstly, camera-frame SMPL-X estimation methods readily recover absolute human depth. Secondly, human motions inherently provide absolute spatial cues. By integrating these insights, we introduce a novel framework, referred to as WHAC, to facilitate world-grounded expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) alongside camera pose estimation, without relying on traditional optimization techniques. Additionally, we present a new synthetic dataset, WHAC-A-Mole, which includes accurately annotated humans and cameras, and features diverse interactive human motions as well as realistic camera trajectories. Extensive experiments on both standard and newly established benchmarks highlight the superiority and efficacy of our framework. We will make the code and dataset publicly available.</description>

      <title>TexTile: A Differentiable Metric for Texture Tileability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TexTile, a novel differentiable metric to quantify the degree upon which a texture image can be concatenated with itself without introducing repeating artifacts (i.e., the tileability). Existing methods for tileable texture synthesis focus on general texture quality, but lack explicit analysis of the intrinsic repeatability properties of a texture. In contrast, our TexTile metric effectively evaluates the tileable properties of a texture, opening the door to more informed synthesis and analysis of tileable textures. Under the hood, TexTile is formulated as a binary classifier carefully built from a large dataset of textures of different styles, semantics, regularities, and human annotations.Key to our method is a set of architectural modifications to baseline pre-train image classifiers to overcome their shortcomings at measuring tileability, along with a custom data augmentation and training regime aimed at increasing robustness and accuracy. We demonstrate that TexTile can be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods, including diffusion-based strategies, and generate tileable textures while keeping or even improving the overall texture quality. Furthermore, we show that TexTile can objectively evaluate any tileable texture synthesis method, whereas the current mix of existing metrics produces uncorrelated scores which heavily hinders progress in the field.</description>

      <title>ANIM: Accurate Neural Implicit Model for Human Reconstruction from a single RGB-D image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in human shape learning, shows that neural implicit models are effective in generating 3D human surfaces from limited number of views, and even from a single RGB image. However, existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face, hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM, a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships, mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy, which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB, surface normals, point cloud or RGB-D data as input. In addition, we introduce ANIM-Real, a new multi-modal dataset comprising high-quality scans paired with consumer-grade RGB-D camera, and our protocol to fine-tune ANIM, enabling high-quality reconstruction from real-world human capture.</description>

      <title>Generic 3D Diffusion Adapter Using Controlled Multi-View Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-domain 3D object synthesis has been lagging behind image synthesis due to limited data and higher computational complexity. To bridge this gap, recent works have investigated multi-view diffusion but often fall short in either 3D consistency, visual quality, or efficiency. This paper proposes MVEdit, which functions as a 3D counterpart of SDEdit, employing ancestral sampling to jointly denoise multi-view images and output high-quality textured meshes. Built on off-the-shelf 2D diffusion models, MVEdit achieves 3D consistency through a training-free 3D Adapter, which lifts the 2D views of the last timestep into a coherent 3D representation, then conditions the 2D views of the next timestep using rendered views, without uncompromising visual quality. With an inference time of only 2-5 minutes, this framework achieves better trade-off between quality and speed than score distillation. MVEdit is highly versatile and extendable, with a wide range of applications including text/image-to-3D generation, 3D-to-3D editing, and high-quality texture synthesis. In particular, evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both image-to-3D and text-guided texture generation tasks. Additionally, we introduce a method for fine-tuning 2D latent diffusion models on small 3D datasets with limited resources, enabling fast low-resolution text-to-3D initialization.</description>
