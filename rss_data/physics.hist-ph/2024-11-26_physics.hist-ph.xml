      <title>Effective Theory Building and Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold learning and effective model building are generally viewed as fundamentally different types of procedure. After all, in one we build a simplified model of the data, in the other, we construct a simplified model of the another model. Nonetheless, I argue that certain kinds of high-dimensional effective model building, and effective field theory construction in quantum field theory, can be viewed as special cases of manifold learning. I argue that this helps to shed light on all of these techniques. First, it suggests that the effective model building procedure depends upon a certain kind of algorithmic compressibility requirement. All three approaches assume that real-world systems exhibit certain redundancies, due to regularities. The use of these regularities to build simplified models is essential for scientific progress in many different domains.</description>

      <title>The lunar eclipse and the dawn of astrophysics in van Gogh's masterpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When visiting the Museum of Modern Art's special exhibit ''van Gogh and the Colors of the Night (New York, USA, 2008)'' I was impressed by the artist's effort to paint and write about landscapes and life scenes at night. At the same time a clear contrast emerged between the colored Starry Night paint and the darkness or twilight in his earlier production. Since then, while revising van Gogh's artistic production and reading his letters I have come to the conclusion that his work was not only driven by the poetry of the night but also by his awareness of the dawn of astrophysics in the 19th century. A change in the way the artist conceived the sky after his stay in Paris is evident in his later work with the skies becoming more dynamic and rich in colors. In this paper I am presenting new elements in van Gogh's masterpieces that refer to astronomical events visible from France in 1889 and 1890, such as a lunar eclipse and planetary conjunctions. I discuss these elements in addition to the structured and colorful stars and to the large neutral central swirl in the Starry Night, which all suggest the artist's profound attention to celestial phenomena and knowledge of the new wonders and discoveries of astrophysics in 19th century.</description>
