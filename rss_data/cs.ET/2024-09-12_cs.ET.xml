      <title>Five Key Enablers for Communication during and after Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Civilian communication during disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and military conflicts is crucial for saving lives. Nevertheless, several challenges exist during these circumstances such as the destruction of cellular communication and electricity infrastructure, lack of line of sight (LoS), and difficulty of localization under the rubble. In this article, we discuss key enablers that can boost communication during disasters, namely, satellite and aerial platforms, redundancy, silencing, and sustainable networks aided with wireless energy transfer (WET). The article also highlights how these solutions can be implemented in order to solve the failure of communication during disasters. Finally, it sheds light on unresolved challenges, as well as future research directions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Electro-Optic Analog Memory for Neuromorphic Photonic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and ADCs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and compares various analog memory technologies for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Connecting physics to systems with modular spin-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An emerging paradigm in modern electronics is that of CMOS + $\sf X$ requiring the integration of standard CMOS technology with novel materials and technologies denoted by $\sf X$. In this context, a crucial challenge is to develop accurate circuit models for $\sf X$ that are compatible with standard models for CMOS-based circuits and systems. In this perspective, we present physics-based, experimentally benchmarked modular circuit models that can be used to evaluate a class of CMOS + $\sf X$ systems, where $\sf X$ denotes magnetic and spintronic materials and phenomena. This class of materials is particularly challenging because they go beyond conventional charge-based phenomena and involve the spin degree of freedom which involves non-trivial quantum effects. Starting from density matrices $-$ the central quantity in quantum transport $-$ using well-defined approximations, it is possible to obtain spin-circuits that generalize ordinary circuit theory to 4-component currents and voltages (1 for charge and 3 for spin). With step-by-step examples that progressively become more complex, we illustrate how the spin-circuit approach can be used to start from the physics of magnetism and spintronics to enable accurate system-level evaluations. We believe the core approach can be extended to include other quantum degrees of freedom like valley and pseudospins starting from corresponding density matrices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 35.4% (observing only V ) by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy and anti-commutative properties of the operations on the observable of the senders and receiver. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 65.5% (observing only V ), which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system regarding practical usage. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Reality: 5G Positioning with Open-Source Implementation of UL-TDoA in OpenAirInterface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, an open-source implementation of the 3GPP Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) positioning method using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. UL-TDoA is a critical positioning technique in 5G networks, leveraging the time differences of signal arrival at multiple base stations to determine the precise location of User Equipment (UE). This implementation aims to democratize access to advanced positioning technology by integrating UL-TDoA capabilities into both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) components of OAI, providing a comprehensive and 3GPP-compliant solution. The development includes the incorporation of essential protocol procedures, message flows, and interfaces as defined by 3GPP standards. Validation is conducted using two distinct methods: an OAI-RF simulator-based setup for controlled testing and an O-RAN-based Localization Testbed at EURECOM in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate the viability of this open-source UL-TDoA implementation, enabling precise positioning in various environments. By making this implementation publicly available, the study paves the way for widespread research, development, and innovation in the field of 5G positioning technologies, fostering collaboration and accelerating the advancement of cellular network positioning.</description>
