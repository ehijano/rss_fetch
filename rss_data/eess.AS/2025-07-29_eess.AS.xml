      <title>Binaural Speech Enhancement Using Complex Convolutional Recurrent Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From hearing aids to augmented and virtual reality devices, binaural speech enhancement algorithms have been established as state-of-the-art techniques to improve speech intelligibility and listening comfort. In this paper, we present an end-to-end binaural speech enhancement method using a complex recurrent convolutional network with an encoder-decoder architecture and a complex LSTM recurrent block placed between the encoder and decoder. A loss function that focuses on the preservation of spatial information in addition to speech intelligibility improvement and noise reduction is introduced. The network estimates individual complex ratio masks for the left and right-ear channels of a binaural hearing device in the time-frequency domain. We show that, compared to other baseline algorithms, the proposed method significantly improves the estimated speech intelligibility and reduces the noise while preserving the spatial information of the binaural signals in acoustic situations with a single target speaker and isotropic noise of various types.</description>

      <title>Binaural Localization Model for Speech in Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaural acoustic source localization is important to human listeners for spatial awareness, communication and safety. In this paper, an end-to-end binaural localization model for speech in noise is presented. A lightweight convolutional recurrent network that localizes sound in the frontal azimuthal plane for noisy reverberant binaural signals is introduced. The model incorporates additive internal ear noise to represent the frequency-dependent hearing threshold of a typical listener. The localization performance of the model is compared with the steered response power algorithm, and the use of the model as a measure of interaural cue preservation for binaural speech enhancement methods is studied. A listening test was performed to compare the performance of the model with human localization of speech in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Binaural Sound Event Localization and Detection based on HRTF Cues for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Binaural Sound Event Localization and Detection (BiSELD), a task that aims to jointly detect and localize multiple sound events using binaural audio, inspired by the spatial hearing mechanism of humans. To support this task, we present a synthetic benchmark dataset, called the Binaural Set, which simulates realistic auditory scenes using measured head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and diverse sound events. To effectively address the BiSELD task, we propose a new input feature representation called the Binaural Time-Frequency Feature (BTFF), which encodes interaural time difference (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), and high-frequency spectral cues (SC) from binaural signals. BTFF is composed of eight channels, including left and right mel-spectrograms, velocity-maps, SC-maps, and ITD-/ILD-maps, designed to cover different spatial cues across frequency bands and spatial axes. A CRNN-based model, BiSELDnet, is then developed to learn both spectro-temporal patterns and HRTF-based localization cues from BTFF. Experiments on the Binaural Set show that each BTFF sub-feature enhances task performance: V-map improves detection, ITD-/ILD-maps enable accurate horizontal localization, and SC-map captures vertical spatial cues. The final system achieves a SELD error of 0.110 with 87.1% F-score and 4.4{\deg} localization error, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in mimicking human-like auditory perception.</description>

      <title>MIMII-Agent: Leveraging LLMs with Function Calling for Relative Evaluation of Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels, limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions, converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds. We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data. Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.</description>

      <title>End-to-End DOA-Guided Speech Extraction in Noisy Multi-Talker Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) plays a critical role in enhancing speech signals in noisy and multi-speaker environments. This paper presents an end-to-end TSE model that incorporates Direction of Arrival (DOA) and beamwidth embeddings to extract speech from a specified spatial region centered around the DOA. Our approach efficiently captures spatial and temporal features, enabling robust performance in highly complex scenarios with multiple simultaneous speakers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model not only significantly enhances the target speech within the defined beamwidth but also effectively suppresses interference from other directions, producing a clear and isolated target voice. Furthermore, the model achieves remarkable improvements in downstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks, making it particularly suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Feature and Output Distillation for Low-complexity Acoustic Scene Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a dual-level knowledge distillation framework with multi-teacher guidance for low-complexity acoustic scene classification (ASC) in DCASE2025 Task 1. We propose a distillation strategy that jointly transfers both soft logits and intermediate feature representations. Specifically, we pre-trained PaSST and CP-ResNet models as teacher models. Logits from teachers are averaged to generate soft targets, while one CP-ResNet is selected for feature-level distillation. This enables the compact student model (CP-Mobile) to capture both semantic distribution and structural information from teacher guidance. Experiments on the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2022 Mobile dataset (development set) demonstrate that our submitted systems achieve up to 59.30\% accuracy.</description>

      <title>ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long contexts.</description>

      <title>Do Not Mimic My Voice: Speaker Identity Unlearning for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy, research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper, we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems. To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices, assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers, effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for other speakers.

      <title>Self-Improvement for Audio Large Language Model using Unlabeled Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent audio LLMs have emerged rapidly, demonstrating strong generalization across various speech tasks. However, given the inherent complexity of speech signals, these models inevitably suffer from performance degradation in specific target domains. To address this, we focus on enhancing audio LLMs in target domains without any labeled data. We propose a self-improvement method called SI-SDA, leveraging the information embedded in large-model decoding to evaluate the quality of generated pseudo labels and then perform domain adaptation based on reinforcement learning optimization. Experimental results show that our method consistently and significantly improves audio LLM performance, outperforming existing baselines in WER and BLEU across multiple public datasets of automatic speech recognition (ASR), spoken question-answering (SQA), and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Furthermore, our approach exhibits high data efficiency, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Two Views, One Truth: Spectral and Self-Supervised Features Fusion for Robust Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic speech have made audio deepfakes increasingly realistic, posing significant security risks. Existing detection methods that rely on a single modality, either raw waveform embeddings or spectral based features, are vulnerable to non spoof disturbances and often overfit to known forgery algorithms, resulting in poor generalization to unseen attacks. To address these shortcomings, we investigate hybrid fusion frameworks that integrate self supervised learning (SSL) based representations with handcrafted spectral descriptors (MFCC , LFCC, CQCC). By aligning and combining complementary information across modalities, these fusion approaches capture subtle artifacts that single feature approaches typically overlook. We explore several fusion strategies, including simple concatenation, cross attention, mutual cross attention, and a learnable gating mechanism, to optimally blend SSL features with fine grained spectral cues. We evaluate our approach on four challenging public benchmarks and report generalization performance. All fusion variants consistently outperform an SSL only baseline, with the cross attention strategy achieving the best generalization with a 38% relative reduction in equal error rate (EER). These results confirm that joint modeling of waveform and spectral views produces robust, domain agnostic representations for audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second language (L2) learners can improve their pronunciation by imitating golden speech, especially when the speech that aligns with their respective speech characteristics. This study explores the hypothesis that learner-specific golden speech generated with zero-shot text-to-speech (ZS-TTS) techniques can be harnessed as an effective metric for measuring the pronunciation proficiency of L2 learners. Building on this exploration, the contributions of this study are at least two-fold: 1) design and development of a systematic framework for assessing the ability of a synthesis model to generate golden speech, and 2) in-depth investigations of the effectiveness of using golden speech in automatic pronunciation assessment (APA). Comprehensive experiments conducted on the L2-ARCTIC and Speechocean762 benchmark datasets suggest that our proposed modeling can yield significant performance improvements with respect to various assessment metrics in relation to some prior arts. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the role of golden speech in both ZS-TTS and APA, offering a promising regime for computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT).</description>

      <title>RADE: A Neural Codec for Transmitting Speech over HF Radio Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech compression is commonly used to send voice over radio channels in applications such as mobile telephony and two-way push-to-talk (PTT) radio. In classical systems, the speech codec is combined with forward error correction, modulation and radio hardware. In this paper we describe an autoencoder that replaces many of the traditional signal processing elements with a neural network. The encoder takes a vocoder feature set (short term spectrum, pitch, voicing), and produces discrete time, but continuously valued quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols. We use orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) to send and receive these symbols over high frequency (HF) radio channels. The decoder converts received QAM symbols to vocoder features suitable for synthesis. The autoencoder has been trained to be robust to additive Gaussian noise and multipath channel impairments while simultaneously maintaining a Peak To Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of less than 1 dB. Over simulated and real world HF radio channels we have achieved output speech intelligibility that clearly surpasses existing analog and digital radio systems over a range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Neural Spectral Band Generation for Audio Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral band replication (SBR) enables bit-efficient coding by generating high-frequency bands from the low-frequency ones. However, it only utilizes coarse spectral features upon a subband-wise signal replication, limiting adaptability to diverse acoustic signals. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of a deep neural network (DNN)-based generative approach for coding the high-frequency bands, which we call neural spectral band generation (n-SBG). Specifically, we propose a DNN-based encoder-decoder structure to extract and quantize the side information related to the high-frequency components and generate the components given both the side information and the decoded core-band signals. The whole coding pipeline is optimized with generative adversarial criteria to enable the generation of perceptually plausible sound. From experiments using AAC as the core codec, we show that the proposed method achieves a better perceptual quality than HE-AAC-v1 with much less side information.</description>

      <title>SpecASR: Accelerating LLM-based Automatic Speech Recognition via Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its high recognition accuracy and enhanced multi-dialect support. However, the high decoding latency of LLMs challenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has been explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key characteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce the real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative decoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed based on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which results in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given output mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features an adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the draft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further proposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously generated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a two-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the latency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the baseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively, without any loss in recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations.

      <title>Computer Audition: From Task-Specific Machine Learning to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly spearheading recent advances on a variety of tasks that fall under the purview of computer audition -- the use of machines to understand sounds. They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Open-ended Audio Dialogue Understanding for Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), such as GPT-4o, have recently unlocked audio dialogue capabilities, enabling direct spoken exchanges with humans. The potential of LALMs broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., "Really!?" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments on 16 LALMs, our analysis reveals that existing LALMs struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones. The benchmark is available at https://adu-bench.github.io/.</description>

      <title>TAIL: Text-Audio Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many studies combine text and audio to capture multi-modal information but they overlook the model's generalization ability on new datasets. Introducing new datasets may affect the feature space of the original dataset, leading to catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, large model parameters can significantly impact training performance. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task called Text-Audio Incremental Learning (TAIL) task for text-audio retrieval, and propose a new method, PTAT, Prompt Tuning for Audio-Text incremental learning. This method utilizes prompt tuning to optimize the model parameters while incorporating an audio-text similarity and feature distillation module to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We benchmark our method and previous incremental learning methods on AudioCaps, Clotho, BBC Sound Effects and Audioset datasets, and our method outperforms previous methods significantly, particularly demonstrating stronger resistance to forgetting on older datasets. Compared to the full-parameters Finetune (Sequential) method, our model only requires 2.42\% of its parameters, achieving 4.46\% higher performance.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis of Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Speech Language Model (SLM) scaling analysis paints a bleak picture. It predicts that SLMs require much more compute and data compared to text, leading some to question the feasibility of training high-quality SLMs. However, modern SLMs are often initialised from pre-trained TextLMs using speech-text interleaving to allow knowledge transfer. This raises the question - "Do interleaved SLMs scale more efficiently than textless-SLMs?" In this paper we answer a resounding yes! We conduct scaling analysis of interleaved SLMs by training several dozen and analysing the scaling trends. We see that under this setup SLMs scale more efficiently with compute. Additionally, our results indicate that the scaling dynamics significantly differ from textless-SLMs, suggesting one should allocate notably more of the compute budget to increasing model size over training tokens. We also study the role of synthetic data and TextLM model families in unlocking this potential. Results suggest that our scaled up model achieves comparable semantic speech performance to leading models, while using less compute and data.

      <title>FMSD-TTS: Few-shot Multi-Speaker Multi-Dialect Text-to-Speech Synthesis for \"U-Tsang, Amdo and Kham Speech Dataset Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.</description>

      <title>ChildGuard: A Specialized Dataset for Combatting Child-Targeted Hate Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hate speech targeting children on social media is a serious and growing problem, yet current NLP systems struggle to detect it effectively. This gap exists mainly because existing datasets focus on adults, lack age specific labels, miss nuanced linguistic cues, and are often too small for robust modeling. To address this, we introduce ChildGuard, the first large scale English dataset dedicated to hate speech aimed at children. It contains 351,877 annotated examples from X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and YouTube, labeled by three age groups: younger children (under 11), pre teens (11--12), and teens (13--17). The dataset is split into two subsets for fine grained analysis: a contextual subset (157K) focusing on discourse level features, and a lexical subset (194K) emphasizing word-level sentiment and vocabulary. Benchmarking state of the art hate speech models on ChildGuard reveals notable drops in performance, highlighting the challenges of detecting child directed hate speech.</description>

      <title>BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1: A Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a major shortage of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) datasets for high resource-to-low resource language pairs such as English-to-Yoruba. Thus, in this study, we curated the Bilingual English-to-Yoruba Speech-to-Speech Translation Corpus Version 1 (BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1). The corpus is based on a hybrid architecture we developed for large-scale direct S2ST corpus creation at reduced cost. To achieve this, we leveraged non speech-to-speech Standard Yoruba (SY) real-time audios and transcripts in the YORULECT Corpus as well as the corresponding Standard English (SE) transcripts. YORULECT Corpus is small scale(1,504) samples, and it does not have paired English audios. Therefore, we generated the SE audios using pre-trained AI models (i.e. Facebook MMS). We also developed an audio augmentation algorithm named AcoustAug based on three latent acoustic features to generate augmented audios from the raw audios of the two languages. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 has 12,032 audio samples per language, which gives a total of 24,064 sample size. The total audio duration for the two languages is 41.20 hours. This size is quite significant. Beyond building S2ST models, BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 can be used to build pretrained models or improve existing ones. The created corpus and Coqui framework were used to build a pretrained Yoruba TTS model (named YoruTTS-0.5) as a proof of concept. The YoruTTS-0.5 gave a F0 RMSE value of 63.54 after 1,000 epochs, which indicates moderate fundamental pitch similarity with the reference real-time audio. Ultimately, the corpus architecture in this study can be leveraged by researchers and developers to curate datasets for multilingual high-resource-to-low-resource African languages. This will bridge the huge digital divides in translations among high and low-resource language pairs. BENYO-S2ST-Corpus-1 and YoruTTS-0.5 are publicly available at (https://bit.ly/40bGMwi).</description>

      <title>Seed LiveInterpret 2.0: End-to-end Simultaneous Speech-to-speech Translation with Your Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study, we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency, validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios. Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.</description>
