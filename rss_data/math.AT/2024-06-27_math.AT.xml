      <title>The equivariant model structure on cartesian cubical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a constructive model of homotopy type theory in a Quillen model category that classically presents the usual homotopy theory of spaces. Our model is based on presheaves over the cartesian cube category, a well-behaved Eilenberg-Zilber category. The key innovation is an additional equivariance condition in the specification of the cubical Kan fibrations, which can be described as the pullback of an interval-based class of uniform fibrations in the category of symmetric sequences of cubical sets. The main technical results in the development of our model have been formalized in a computer proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Cobordism Obstructions to Complex Sections II: Torsion Obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we studied the existence of complex sections on almost complex manifolds up to cobordism. We proved a necessary and sufficient condition for their existence in $\Omega_{*}^U\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ in terms of the Chern classes. In this paper we study the existence question in $\Omega^{U}_*$. We call corresponding obstructions torsion and we determine them for small values of $r$. Calculations with the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence for the Thom spectra defined in the previous paper allow us to show the vanishing of the torsion obstruction for low $r$. For prime $p$, we show the vanishing of $p$ torsion obstructions for finding $r$ complex sections for $r&lt;p^2-p$.</description>

      <title>Graded $p$-polar rings and the homology of $\Omega^n\Sigma^nX$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an extension of previous ungraded work, we define a graded $p$-polar ring to be an analog of a graded commutative ring where multiplication is only allowed on $p$-tuples (instead of pairs) of elements of equal degree. We show that the free affine $p$-adic group scheme functor, as well as the free formal group functor, defined on $k$-algebras for a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$, factors through $p$-polar $k$-algebras. It follows that the same is true for any affine $p$-adic or formal group functor, in particular for the functor of $p$-typical Witt vectors. As an application, we show that the homology of the free $E_n$-algebra $H^*(\Omega^n\Sigma^n X;\mathbf F_p)$, as a Hopf algebra, only depends on the $p$-polar structure of $H^*(X;\mathbf F_p)$ in a functorial way.</description>

      <title>The mod-2 cohomology groups of low-dimensional unordered flag manifolds and Auerbach bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unordered flag manifolds are the manifolds of unordered $n$-tuple of mutually orthogonal lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we develop some basic tools to compute the mod-$2$ cohomology groups of these spaces, and apply them for explicit computation for small $n$. We show that this computation improves the known estimate of the number of Auerbach bases of normed linear spaces of small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological data quality via 0-dimensional persistence matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data quality is crucial for the successful training, generalization and performance of artificial intelligence models. We propose to measure data quality for supervised learning using topological data analysis techniques. Specifically, we provide a novel topological invariant based on persistence matchings induced by inclusions and using $0$-dimensional persistent homology. We show that such an invariant is stable. We provide an algorithm and relate it to images, kernels, and cokernels of the induced morphisms. Also, we show that the invariant allows us to understand whether the subset "represents well" the clusters from the larger dataset or not, and we also use it to estimate bounds for the Hausdorff distance between the subset and the complete dataset. This approach enables us to explain why the chosen dataset will lead to poor performance.</description>

      <title>Farber's conjecture and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey two decades of work on the (sequential) topological complexity of configuration spaces of graphs (ordered and unordered), aiming to give an account that is unifying, elementary, and self-contained. We discuss the traditional approach through cohomology, with its limitations, and the more modern approach through asphericity and the fundamental group, explaining how they are in fact variations on the same core ideas. We close with a list of open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Equivariant parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study an equivariant analogue of Cohen, Farber and Weinberger's parametrized topological complexity. We show that several results in the non-equivariant case can be extended to the equivariant case. For example, we establish the fibrewise equivariant homotopy invariance of the sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity. We obtain several bounds on sequential equivariant topological complexity involving equivariant category. We also obtain the cohomological lower bound and the dimension-connectivity upper bound on the sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity. In the end we use these results to compute sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity of equivariant Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations and some equivariant fibrations involving generalized projective product spaces.</description>

      <title>Notes characterising higher and derived stacks concretely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4853</link>
      <description>arXiv:1105.4853v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an informal summary of the main concepts in arXiv:0905.4044, based on notes of various seminars. It gives constructions of higher and derived stacks without recourse to the extensive theory developed by Toen, Vezzosi and Lurie. Explicitly, higher stacks are described in terms of simplicial diagrams of affine schemes, which are analogous to atlases for manifolds. We also describe quasi-coherent sheaves and complexes on such objects.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>
