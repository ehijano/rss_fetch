      <title>An Orbit-qubit Quantum Processor of Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is challenging to build scalable quantum processors capable of both parallel control and local operation. As a promising platform to overcome this challenge, optical lattices offer exceptional parallelism. However, it has been struggling with precise local operations due to relatively narrow lattice spacings. Here, we introduce a new quantum processor incorporating orbit-qubit encoding and internal states (as auxiliary degrees of freedom) to achieve spatially selective operations together with parallel control. With this processor, we generate one-dimensional and two-dimensional cluster states using minimal layers of controlled-Z gates. We experimentally detect the multipartite entanglement of a two-dimensional cluster state involving 123 orbit qubits through direct stabilizer measurements, verifying the full bipartite non-separability. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-based quantum computation by implementing single-qubit and two-qubit logical gates, highlighting the flexibility of orbit-qubit operations. Our results establish orbit-qubit optical lattices as a scalable quantum processing architecture, opening new pathways for quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transitions in Trapped Superfluids Excited by Alternating Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a survey of some dynamical transitions in nonequilibrium trapped Bose-condensed systems subject to the action of alternating fields. Nonequilibrium states of trapped systems can be realized in two ways, resonant and nonresonant. Under resonant excitation, several coherent modes are generated by external alternating fields, whose frequencies are tuned to resonance with some transition frequencies of the trapped system. A Bose system of trapped atoms with Bose-Einstein condensate can display two types of the Josephson effect, the standard one, when the system is separated into two or more parts in different locations or when there are no any separation barriers, but the system becomes nonuniform due to the coexistence of several coherent modes interacting with each other, which is termed internal Josephson effect. The mathematics in both these cases is similar. We concentrate on the internal Josephson effect. Systems with nonlinear coherent modes demonstrate rich dynamics, including Rabi oscillations, Josephson effect, and chaotic motion. Under Josephson effect, there exist dynamic transitions that are similar to phase transitions in equilibrium systems. The bosonic Josephson effect is shown to be realizable not only for weakly interacting systems, but also in superfluids, with not necessarily weak interactions. Sufficiently strong nonresonant excitation can generate several types of nonequilibrium states comprising vortex germs, vortex rings, vortex lines, vortex turbulence, droplet turbulence, and wave turbulence. Nonequilibrium states can be characterized and distinguished by effective temperature, effective Fresnel number, and dynamic scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensates in a spin-twisted harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phases and spin-scissors dynamics of binary Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a twisted two-dimensional harmonic trap. The ground state hosts three distinct phases-phase-separated, polarized, and phase-mixed-determined by the Rabi coupling, interaction ratio G (between inter-component and intra-component interactions), and spin-twisting which induces edge-localized polarization through position-dependent detuning. In the phase-mixed regime, the ground state is characterized by a finite spin-scissors susceptibility and can be accurately described using local density approximation. In the dynamics, the system exhibits stable periodic beating in the phase-mixed state for G&lt;1. For G&gt;1, its evolution progresses from beat damping (phase-separated state) to polarized relaxation (polarized state), finally reaching stable periodic beating (phase-mixed state) after a finite waiting time. The dependence of the waiting time contrasts sharply with the monotonic behavior of one-dimensional spin-dipole dynamics, revealing qualitatively distinct mechanisms governed by geometry and interactions. In summary, these results establish a unified link between ground-state properties and nonequilibrium responses in twisted spinor condensates, offering a versatile platform for exploring spin-related quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>A complex scalar field theory for charged fluids, superfluids, and fracton fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids formulated in terms of a complex scalar field defined on a spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. In the normal phase, the dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum-field-theory dynamics on a spin-phonon quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum field theories in nature is challenging with classical methods, but is a promising application for quantum computers. Unfortunately, simulating interacting bosonic fields involves a high boson-to-qubit encoding overhead. Furthermore, when mapping to qubits, the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of bosons is necessarily truncated, with truncation errors that grow with energy and time. A qubit-based quantum computer, augmented with an active bosonic register, and with qubit, bosonic, and mixed qubit-boson quantum gates, offers a more powerful platform for simulating bosonic theories. We demonstrate this capability experimentally in a hybrid analog-digital trapped-ion quantum computer, where qubits are encoded in the internal states of the ions, and the bosons in the ions' motional states. Specifically, we simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of a (1+1)-dimensional Yukawa model, a simplified model of interacting nucleons and pions, and measure fermion- and boson-occupation-state probabilities. These dynamics populate high bosonic-field excitations starting from an empty state, and the experimental results capture well such high-occupation states. This simulation approaches the regime where classical methods become challenging, bypasses the need for a large qubit overhead, and removes truncation errors. Our results, therefore, open the way to achieving demonstrable quantum advantage in qubit-boson quantum computing.</description>

      <title>High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</description>

      <title>Squeezing atomic $p$-orbital condensates for detecting gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the faint signal of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) stands as a major frontier in gravitational-wave astronomy, pushing the need for detectors whose sensitivity exceeds the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here, we propose an orbital optomechanical (OOM) sensor that exploits the sensitive coupling of an orbitally squeezed $p$-orbital Bose-Einstein condensate to spacetime distortions, enabling the detection of interferometer phase shifts induced by CWs. This sensor achieves a theoretical quantum-noise-limited sensitivity 16 dB below the SQL while reducing the required laser power by five orders of magnitude. The performance arises from a novel noise trade-off: a counter-propagating readout scheme suppresses photonic shot noise, while orbital squeezing minimizes the remaining atomic projection noise. By leveraging quantum control over atomic orbital degrees of freedom, this approach establishes a new framework for interferometric sensing with direct applications to the search for CWs and ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field analysis of the Townes soliton and its breathing mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Bogoliubov perturbation theory we describe the self-bound ground state and excited breathing states of $N$ two-dimensional bosons with zero-range attractive interactions. Our results for the ground state energy $B_N$ and size $R_N$ improve previously known large-$N$ asymptotes and we better understand the crossover to the few-body regime. The breathing oscillations, absent at the mean-field level, result from the quantum-mechanical breaking of the mean-field scale symmetry. The breathing-mode frequency scales as $\Omega\propto |B_N|/\sqrt{N}$ at large $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schr\"odinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate why, in quantum many-body systems, the adiabatic fidelity and the overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states often yield nearly identical values. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium critical scaling and universality in a quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universality and scaling laws are hallmarks of equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena. However, extending these concepts to non-equilibrium systems is an outstanding challenge. Despite recent progress in the study of dynamical phases, the universality classes and scaling laws for non-equilibrium phenomena are far less understood than those in equilibrium. In this work, using a trapped-ion quantum simulator with single-spin resolution, we investigate the non-equilibrium nature of critical fluctuations following a quantum quench to the critical point. We probe the scaling of spin fluctuations after a series of quenches to the critical Hamiltonian of a long-range Ising model. With systems of up to 50 spins, we show that the amplitude and timescale of the post-quench fluctuations scale with system size with distinct universal critical exponents, depending on the quench protocol. While a generic quench can lead to thermal critical behavior, we find that a second quench from one critical state to another (i.e.~a double quench) results in a new universal non-equilibrium behavior, identified by a set of critical exponents distinct from their equilibrium counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of quantum simulators to explore universal scaling beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On polarons and dimerons in the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional spin-up ideal Fermi gas interacting attractively with a spin-down impurity in the continuum undergoes, at zero temperature, a first-order phase transition from a polaron to a dimeron state. Here we study a similar system on a square lattice, by considering the attractive 2D Fermi-Hubbard model with a single spin-down and a finite filling fraction of spin-up fermions. We study polaron and dimeron quasi-particle properties via variational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation. Moreover, we develop a determinant diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm for this problem based on expansion in bare on-site coupling $U$. This algorithm turns out to be sign-problem free at any filling of spin-up fermions, allowing one to sample very high diagram order (larger than $200$ in our study) and to do simulations for large $U/t$ (we go up to $U/t=-20$ with $t$ the hopping strength). Both methods give qualitatively consistent results. With variational Ansatz we go to even larger on-site attraction. In contrast with the continuum case, we do not observe any polaron-to-dimeron transition for a range of spin-up filling fractions $\rho_{\uparrow}$ between $0.1$ and $0.4$. % (away from the low-filling limit). The polaron state always gives a lower energy and has a finite quasi-particle residue.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we demonstrate that the multiphoton JCHM exhibits quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI) phase, the superfluid phase, and an additional phase we refer to as the forbidden phase. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. When this conserved quantity diverges toward positive infinity, this system enters the forbidden phase. By analyzing the system, we observe MI, superfluid, and forbidden phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs, although the MI phases in the two-photon case are confined to subspaces with small values of the conserved quantity. In contrast, only the superfluid and forbidden phases appear in the three- and four-photon JCHMs, with no MI phase observed.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model. Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its non-equilibrium dynamics. We continuously tune the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by controlling the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of one additional vibration introduces interfering vibrationally assisted pathways and reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.</description>
