      <title>GNN with Model-based RL for Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) constitute a significant role in exploring machine intelligence and advanced applications. In order to deeply investigate complicated interactions within MAS scenarios, we originally propose "GNN for MBRL" model, which utilizes a state-spaced Graph Neural Networks with Model-based Reinforcement Learning to address specific MAS missions (e.g., Billiard-Avoidance, Autonomous Driving Cars). In detail, we firstly used GNN model to predict future states and trajectories of multiple agents, then applied the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) optimized Model Predictive Control to assist the ego-agent planning actions and successfully accomplish certain MAS tasks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm using a cluster-synchronized laser network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies crucial principles that are applicable to a variety of fields, including wireless networking and autonomous driving. We propose a photonic-based decision-making algorithm to address one of the most fundamental problems in MARL, called the competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that chaotic oscillations and cluster synchronization of optically coupled lasers, along with our proposed decentralized coupling adjustment, efficiently balance exploration and exploitation while facilitating cooperative decision-making without explicitly sharing information among agents. Our study demonstrates how decentralized reinforcement learning can be achieved by exploiting complex physical processes controlled by simple algorithms.</description>

      <title>Condorcet Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies information markets concerning single events from an epistemic social choice perspective. Within the classical Condorcet error model for collective binary decisions, we establish equivalence results between elections and markets, showing that the alternative that would be selected by weighted majority voting (under specific weighting schemes) corresponds to the alternative with highest price in the equilibrium of the market (under specific assumptions on the market type). This makes it possible in principle to implement specific weighted majority elections, which are known to have superior truth-tracking performance, by means of information markets without needing to elicit voters' competences.</description>

      <title>RAGAR, Your Falsehood Radar: RAG-Augmented Reasoning for Political Fact-Checking using Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating challenge of misinformation, particularly in political discourse, requires advanced fact-checking solutions; this is even clearer in the more complex scenario of multimodal claims. We tackle this issue using a multimodal large language model in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and introduce two novel reasoning techniques: Chain of RAG (CoRAG) and Tree of RAG (ToRAG). They fact-check multimodal claims by extracting both textual and image content, retrieving external information, and reasoning subsequent questions to be answered based on prior evidence. We achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.85, surpassing a baseline reasoning technique by 0.14 points. Human evaluation confirms that the vast majority of our generated fact-check explanations contain all information from gold standard data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adaptation in Mixed-Motive Environments via Hierarchical Opponent Modeling and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent successes of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, efficiently adapting to co-players in mixed-motive environments remains a significant challenge. One feasible approach is to hierarchically model co-players' behavior based on inferring their characteristics. However, these methods often encounter difficulties in efficient reasoning and utilization of inferred information. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Opponent modeling and Planning (HOP), a novel multi-agent decision-making algorithm that enables few-shot adaptation to unseen policies in mixed-motive environments. HOP is hierarchically composed of two modules: an opponent modeling module that infers others' goals and learns corresponding goal-conditioned policies, and a planning module that employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to identify the best response. Our approach improves efficiency by updating beliefs about others' goals both across and within episodes and by using information from the opponent modeling module to guide planning. Experimental results demonstrate that in mixed-motive environments, HOP exhibits superior few-shot adaptation capabilities when interacting with various unseen agents, and excels in self-play scenarios. Furthermore, the emergence of social intelligence during our experiments underscores the potential of our approach in complex multi-agent environments.</description>

      <title>Aligning Cyber Space with Physical World: A Comprehensive Survey on Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.
