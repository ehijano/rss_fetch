      <title>L^2-instability of the Taub-Bolt metric under the Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that there exists a compact perturbation of the Ricci flat Taub-Bolt metric that evolves under the Ricci flow into a finite time singularity modelled on the shrinking solition FIK [5]. Moreover, this perturbation can be made arbitrarily L^2-small with respect to the Taub-Bolt metric. The method of proof closely follows the strategy adopted in [14], where the author constructs, via a Wa\.zewski box argument, Ricci flows on compact manifolds which encounter finite singularities modelled on a given asymptotically conical shrinking soliton.</description>

      <title>Harmonic metrics of $\mathrm{SO}_{0}(n,n)$-Higgs bundles in the Hitchin section on non-compact hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface. Using the canonical line bundle $K$ and some holomorphic differentials $\boldsymbol{q}$, Hitchin constructed the $G$-Higgs bundles in the Hitchin section for a split real form $G$ of a complex simple Lie group. We study the ${\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$ case. In our work, we establish the existence of harmonic metrics for these Higgs bundles, which are compatible with the ${\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$-structure for any non-compact hyperbolic Riemann surface. Moreover, these harmonic metrics also weakly dominate $h_X$ which is the natural diagonal harmonic metric induced by the unique complete K\"ahler hyperbolic metric $g_X$ on $X$. Assuming that these holomorphic differentials are all bounded with respect to the metric $g_X$, we are able to prove the uniqueness of such a harmonic metric.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Flow: Shi-Type Estimates and Long-time Existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time existence of the anomaly flow on a compact complex $3$-fold with general slope parameter $\alpha'$. In particular, we obtain integral Shi-type estimates for the flow by adapting a integration-by-parts type argument instead of the usual maximum principle techniques. Following this, we prescribe a sufficient smallness condition on $\alpha'$ in order to extend the flow on $[0,\tau)$ to $[0,\tau + \epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tanaka prolongation and convergence of formal equivalence between embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The works of Commichau--Grauert and Hirschowitz showed that a formal equivalence between embeddings of a compact complex manifold is convergent, if the embeddings have sufficiently positive normal bundles in a suitable sense. We show that the convergence still holds under the weaker assumption of semi-positive normal bundles if some geometric conditions are satisfied. Our result can be applied to many examples of general minimal rational curves, including general lines on a smooth hypersurface of degree less than $n$ in the $(n+1)$-dimensional projective space. As a key ingredient of our arguments, we formulate and prove a generalized version of Tanaka's prolongation procedure for geometric structures subordinate to vector distributions, a result of independent interest. When applied to the universal family of the deformations of the compact submanifolds satisfying our geometric conditions, the generalized Tanaka prolongation gives a natural absolute parallelism on a suitable fiber space. A formal equivalence of embeddings must preserve these absolute parallelisms, which implies its convergence.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler Immersions of ALE K\"ahler Manifolds into Complex Space Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the K\"ahler immersions of special Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (ALE) K\"ahler metrics into complex space forms. We provide a relation between K\"ahler immersions problem of these metrics and the sign of their mass. Our result shows that these metrics with positive mass do not admit a K\"ahler immersion into complex Euclidean space. Moreover, we also obtain that these metrics with any sign of mass cannot be K\"ahler immersed into complex hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Geometric analysis on weighted manifolds under lower $0$-weighted Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop geometric analysis on weighted Riemannian manifolds under lower $0$-weighted Ricci curvature bounds. Under such curvature bounds, we prove a first Steklov eigenvalue estimate of Wang-Xia type on compact weighted manifolds with boundary, and a first eigenvalue estimate of Choi-Wang type on closed weighted minimal hypersurfaces. We also produce an ABP estimate and a Sobolev inequality of Brendle type.</description>

      <title>Cartan-Schouten metrics for information geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Cartan-Schouten metrics, explore invariant dual connections, and propose them as models for Information Geometry.
  Based on the underlying Riemannian barycenter and the biinvariant mean of Lie groups, we subsequently propose a new parametric mean for data science and machine learning which comes with several advantages compared to traditional tools such as the arithmetic mean, median, mode, expectation, least square method, maximum likelihood, linear regression. We call a metric on a Lie group, a Cartan-Schouten metric, if its Levi-Civita connection is biinvariant, so every 1-parameter subgroup through the unit is a geodesic.
  Except for not being left or right invariant in general, Cartan-Schouten metrics enjoy the same geometry as biinvariant metrics, since they share the same Levi-Civita connection. To bypass the non-invariance apparent drawback, we show that Cartan-Schouten metrics are completely determined by their value at the unit. We give an explicit formula for recovering them from their value at the unit, thus making them much less computationally demanding, compared to general metrics on manifolds. Furthermore, Lie groups with Cartan-Schouten metrics are complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We give a complete characterization of Lie groups with Riemannian or Lorentzian Cartan-Schouten metrics. Cartan-Schouten metrics are in abundance on 2-nilpotent Lie groups. Namely, on every 2-nilpotent Lie group, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of left invariant metrics and that of Cartan-Schouten metrics.</description>

      <title>How periodic surfaces bend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodic surface is one that is invariant by a 2D lattice of translations. Deformation modes that stretch the lattice without stretching the surface are effective membrane modes. Deformation modes that bend the lattice without stretching the surface are effective bending modes. For periodic, piecewise smooth, simply connected surfaces, it is shown that the effective membrane modes are, in a sense, orthogonal to effective bending modes. This means that if a surface gains a membrane mode, it loses a bending mode, and conversely, in such a way that the total number of modes, membrane and bending combined, can never exceed 3. Various examples, inspired from curved-crease origami tessellations, illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

      <title>Signals as submanifolds, and configurations of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the purposes of abstract theory of signal propagation, a signal is a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold. We obtain energy inequalities, or upper bounds, lower bounds on energy in a number of specific cases, including parameter spaces of Gaussians and spaces of configurations of points. We discuss the role of time as well as graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear soft-tissue elasticity, remodeling, and degradation described by an extended Finsler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuum mechanical theory incorporating an extension of Finsler geometry is formulated for fibrous soft solids. Especially if of biologic origin, such solids are nonlinear elastic with evolving microstructures. For example, elongated cells or collagen fibers can stretch and rotate independently of motions of their embedding matrix. Here, a director vector or internal state vector, not always of unit length, in generalized Finsler space relates to a physical mechanism, with possible preferred direction and intensity, in the microstructure. Classical Finsler geometry is extended to accommodate multiple director vectors (i.e., multiple fibers in both a differential-geometric and physical sense) at each point on the base manifold. A metric tensor can depend on the ensemble of director vector fields. Residual or remnant strains from biologic growth, remodeling, and degradation manifest as non-affine fiber and matrix stretches. These remnant stretch fields are quantified by internal state vectors and a corresponding, generally non-Euclidean, metric tensor. Euler-Lagrange equations derived from a variational principle yield equilibrium configurations satisfying balances of forces from elastic energy, remodeling and cohesive energies, and external chemical-biological interactions. Given certain assumptions, the model can reduce to a representation in Riemannian geometry. Residual stresses that emerge from a non-Euclidean material metric in the Riemannian setting are implicitly included in the Finslerian setting. The theory is used to study stress and damage in the ventricle (heart muscle) expanding or contracting under internal and external pressure. Remnant strains from remodeling can reduce stress concentrations and mitigate tissue damage under severe loading.</description>
