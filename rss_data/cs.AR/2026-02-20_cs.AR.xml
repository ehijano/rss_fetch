      <title>Low-Cost IoT-Enabled Tele-ECG Monitoring for Resource-Constrained Settings: System Design and Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the availability of automation machinery and its superiority, are being slothful and inviting many diseases to invade them. The world still has so many places where people lack basic health facilities. Due to early detection and intervention, CDV can be cured to an extreme extent. It heavily reduces travel and associated costs. A remote ECG monitoring system enables community health workers to support and empower patients through telemedicine. However, there remains some financial and logistical burden. Heart disease cannot be taken lightly. These patients require regular health check-ups and the attention of health personnel in a short period if their health deteriorates suddenly and rapidly. Chronic diseases are extremely variable in their symptoms and evolution of treatment. Some, if not treated early, will end the patient's life. The trend of the INTERNET OF THINGS, IoT, is spreading massively. This paper focuses on the three main: the operator, the doctor, and the server over which the data is being sent.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Dynamic Execution Orchestration Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-specific accelerators deliver exceptional performance on their target workloads through fabrication-time orchestrated datapaths. However, such specialized architectures often exhibit performance fragility when exposed to new kernels or irregular input patterns. In contrast, programmable architectures like FPGAs, CGRAs, and GPUs rely on compile-time orchestration to support a broader range of applications; but they are typically less efficient under irregular or sparse data. Pushing the boundaries of programmable architectures requires designs that can achieve efficiency and high-performance on par with specialized accelerators while retaining the agility of general-purpose architectures.
  We introduce Canon, a parallel architecture that bridges the gap between specialized and general purpose architectures. Canon exploits data-level and instruction-level parallelism through its novel design. First, it employs a novel dynamic data-driven orchestration mechanism using programmable Finite State Machines (FSMs). These FSMs are programmed at compile time to encode high-level dataflow per state and translate incoming meta-information (e.g., sparse coordinates) into control instructions at runtime. Second, Canon introduces a time-lapsed SIMD execution in which instructions are issued across a row of processing elements over several cycles, creating a staggered pipelined execution. These innovations amortize control overhead, allowing dynamic instruction changes while constructing a continuously evolving dataflow that maximizes parallelism. Experimental evaluation shows that Canon delivers high performance across diverse data-agnostic and data-driven kernels while achieving efficiency comparable to specialized accelerators, yet retaining the flexibility of a general-purpose architecture.</description>

      <title>SimulatorCoder: DNN Accelerator Simulator Code Generation and Optimization via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SimulatorCoder, an agent powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to generate and optimize deep neural network (DNN) accelerator simulators based on natural language descriptions. By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development.

      <title>When Models Ignore Definitions: Measuring Semantic Override Hallucinations in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on standard digital logic and Boolean reasoning tasks, yet their reliability under locally redefined semantics remains poorly understood. In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains.</description>

      <title>GDEV-AI: A Generalized Evaluation of Deep Learning Inference Scaling and Architectural Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning inference in production environments continues to grow, where throughput, latency, and hardware efficiency are critical. Although specialized accelerators are increasingly adopted, many inference workloads still run on CPU-only systems, particularly in legacy data centers and cost-sensitive environments. This study investigates the scalability limits of CPU-based inference for convolutional neural networks by benchmarking ResNet models across varying batch sizes on two hardware tiers: a legacy Intel Xeon E5-2403 v2 processor and a modern Intel Xeon 6 "Granite Rapids" platform.
  Results show that legacy CPUs quickly reach throughput saturation, with limited scaling beyond small batch sizes due to instruction-level and memory constraints. In contrast, the Granite Rapids system leverages Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) to achieve substantially higher throughput. However, oversubscription beyond physical core limits introduces execution contention and tail-latency amplification, revealing a performance degradation regime in modern architectures.
  We introduce GDEV-AI, a reproducible benchmarking framework for analyzing scalability behavior and architectural saturation in CPU-based inference. By establishing a vendor-neutral baseline, this work provides empirical insight into performance bottlenecks and informs capacity planning in heterogeneous data center environments.</description>

      <title>ArtNet: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Artificial Netlist Generator for ML and DTCO Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters, ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original (real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of targeted full-scale block designs.</description>
