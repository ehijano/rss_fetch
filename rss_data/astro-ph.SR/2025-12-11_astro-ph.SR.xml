      <title>Distance to the Globular Cluster M 3 from the Infrared Surface Brightness Technique applied to RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Infrared Surface Brightness (IRSB) technique is a specific application of the Baade-Wesselink method. Given a proper calibration, well covered optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as radial velocity curves, it allows for estimation of distances to individual pulsating stars and determination of their mean radii. The technique is fully empirical and does not depend on stellar atmosphere models.
  The goal of the work is to test the precision of distance determinations to individual RR Lyrae stars and to their host system as a whole using the IRSB technique for a relatively distant globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). We also aim to determine mean radii and period-radius relations for these stars in order to compare them with the existing theoretical prediction and empirical estimations for the field stars from the solar neighborhood.
  We use data available in the literature and the calibration of the IRSB technique based on the RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood we published previously in order to determine distances to 14 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster M 3. We study the impact of the selection of the fitting procedure (bisector v.s. the LS fit) on the results. We apply five different empirical surface brightness-color relations from the literature in the analysis.
  We obtained a mean distance to M 3 of $r_{M3} = (10.07 \pm 0.19 \pm 0.29) \,kpc$ that corresponds to a distance modulus ${\mu}_{M3} = (15.015 \pm 0.041 \pm 0.063) \,mag$ and a $7\%$ scatter of individual stellar distances for 14 RR Lyrae stars in M 3. We received a very good agreement between the two fitting techniques. We also determined mean stellar radii for pulsators from the sample with a precision of $0.5\%$ and obtained excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction of the period-radius relation for RRab stars available in the literature.</description>

      <title>iSTARMOD: A Python Code to Quantify Chromospheric Activity by Using the Spectral Subtraction Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of the spectral subtraction technique allows measurements of chromospheric activity in late-type stars across several activity indicators, such as H$\alpha$ and the other Balmer lines in the visible, He I D3 and Na I D1, D2, Ca II H and K, and Ca II infrared triplet, as well as the Paschen series and He I $\lambda$10830 lines in the near-infrared. iSTARMOD is an updated and extended version of the original STARMOD code and its subsequent modifications. iSTARMOD is presented in this paper as a Python code developed to quantify chromospheric activity by using the spectral subtraction technique. iSTARMOD improves usability, modularity, and integration with modern data analysis workflows and is publicly available, including several examples that help one learn how to use and test the code. The iSTARMOD code is accompanied here with a series of calibrations of $\chi$-functions, to transform the excess emission equivalent widths measured through iSTARMOD into absolute surface fluxes. The method provided with this code and the corresponding flux calibrations allows for the automatic characterization of the chromospheric activity of a large number of spectra or a large number of stars and is also very useful for mitigating the effect of activity on radial velocities in the search for exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Tracing a Multi-Temperature Quiescent Prominence's Thermodynamic Evolution from Sun to Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences are cool, dense stable structures routinely observed in the corona. Prominences are often ejected from the Sun via coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, they are rarely detected in a cool, low-ionized state within CMEs measured in situ, making their evolution hard to study. We examine the thermodynamic evolution of one of these rare cases where a quiescent prominence eruption clearly preserves its low-ionized charge state as evidenced by in situ detection. We use multi-viewpoint Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) observations to track and estimate the density, temperature and speed of the prominence as it erupts. We observe that part of the prominence remains in absorption well beyond initial liftoff, indicating the bulk of the prominence experiences minimal ionization and suggesting any strong heating is balanced by radiative losses, expansion, or conduction. From its subsequent in situ passage near 1au, charge states reveal that the prominence is composed of both cool, low-ionized ions as well as hotter plasma reflected by the presence of highly ionized iron, Fe$^{16+}$. Simulated non-equilibrium ionization and recombination results using observationally derived initial conditions match the in situ multi-thermal state for a prominence composed of 70% cool plasma with a 1.8MK peak temperature, and 30% hot plasma with a 4.3MK peak temperature. This suggests that the prominence may not be heated uniformly or that parts of it cools more rapidly. The complex, multi-thermal nature of this erupting prominence emphasizes the need for more comprehensive spectral observations of the global corona.</description>

      <title>Constraining the outer boundary condition for the Babcock-Leighton dynamo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the Sun's large-scale surface magnetic field is well captured by surface flux transport models, which can therefore provide a natural constraint on the outer boundary condition (BC) of Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo models. For the first time, we propose a zero radial diffusion BC for BL dynamo models, enabling their surface field evolution to align consistently with surface flux transport simulations. We derive a zero radial diffusion BC from the Magnetohydrodynamic induction equation and evaluate its effects in comparison with two alternatives: (i) a radial outer BC, and (ii) a radial outer BC combined with strong near-surface radial pumping. The comparison is carried out both for the evolution of a single bipolar magnetic region and within a full BL dynamo model. The zero radial diffusion outer BC effectively suppresses radial diffusion across the surface, ensuring consistency between the evolution of the bipolar magnetic region in the BL dynamo and the surface flux transport model. With this outer BC, the full BL dynamo model successfully reproduces the fundamental properties of the solar cycle. In addition, the model naturally produces a surface magnetic field that is not purely radial, in closer agreement with solar observations. The physically motivated zero radial diffusion boundary condition paves the way for deeper insight into the solar and stellar cycles.</description>

      <title>SN 2022ngb: a faint, slow-evolving Type IIb Supernova with a low-mass envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Magnetic Field Detection at the Surface of $\chi$ Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectropolarimetric observations of $\chi$ Cygni obtained with Neo-Narval at T\'elescope Bernard Lyot in 2025. We obtained observations across three epochs (2025 Jul, Aug, and Oct) near maximum light to search for magnetic field signatures at the stellar photosphere. We detected a clear circular polarization signal in the 2025 Aug observations (pulsation phases $0.99$ to $0.01$). We measure a mean longitudinal magnetic field of $B_l = 3.4 \pm 0.6$ G. No detections were obtained for the 2025 Jul and Oct epochs. The pulsation-phase dependence suggests that field detection is tied to specific shock conditions near maximum light.</description>

      <title>Probing stellar rotation in the Pleiades with gravity-mode pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their proximity, the Pleiades are an important benchmark open cluster. Despite its status, asteroseismic analyses of its members are rare. In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Surface image and activity-corrected orbit of the RS CVn binary HR 7275: Disentangling activity tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying stellar parameters and magnetic activity for cool stars in double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) is not straightforward, as both stars contribute to the observed composite spectra and are likely variable. Disentangled component spectra allow a detailed analysis of a component's magnetic activity.
  We aim at separating the spectra of the two stellar components of the HR\,7275 SB2 system. Our further aim is a more accurate orbital solution by cleaning the observed radial velocities (RV) from activity perturbations of the spotted primary ("RV jitter") and obtain a surface image of this component.
  The Doppler image of the primary shows two large cool spots of size $\approx$20\% of the visible hemisphere plus three smaller spots, each still $\approx$13\% in size. In total, HR\,7275a exhibited an impressive spottedness of $\approx$40\%\ of its entire surface in May-June 2022. The RV is modulated by the rotation of the primary with maximum amplitudes of 320\,\ms\ and 650\,\ms\ for two different modulation behaviors during the 250\,d of our observations. This jitter is primarily caused by the varying asymmetries of the apparent disk brightness due to the cool spots. Its removal resulted in roughly ten times higher precision of the orbital elements. Our snapshot magnetic-field measurements reveal phase-dependent (large-scale) surface fields between +0.6$\pm$2.0\,G at phase 0.1 and $-$15.2$\pm$2.7\,G at phase 0.6, indicating a complex magnetic morphology related to the location of the photospheric spots. We also obtain a logarithmic lithium abundance of 0.58$\pm$0.1 for HR\,7275a, indicating considerable mixing, and 0.16$^{+0.23}_{-0.63}$ for HR\,7275b, which is an extremely low value.

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For more than fourty years, the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major thread of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such "realistic" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</description>

      <title>Predicting CME Arrivals with Heliospheric Imagers from L5: A Data Assimilation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission has laid a foundation for advancing real-time space weather forecasting by enabling the evaluation of heliospheric imager (HI) data for predicting coronal mass ejection (CME) arrivals at Earth. This study employs the ELEvoHI model to assess how incorporating STEREO/HI data from the Lagrange 5 (L5) perspective can enhance prediction accuracy for CME arrival times and speeds. Our investigation, preparing for the upcoming ESA Vigil mission, explores whether the progressive incorporation of HI data in real-time enhances forecasting accuracy. The role of human tracking variability is evaluated by comparing predictions based on observations by three different scientists, highlighting the influence of manual biases on forecasting outcomes. Furthermore, the study examines the efficacy of deriving CME propagation directions using HI-specific methods versus coronagraph-based techniques, emphasising the trade-offs in prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of HI data to significantly improve operational space weather forecasting when integrated with other observational platforms, especially when HI data from beyond 35{\deg} elongation are used. These findings pave the way for optimising real-time prediction methodologies, providing valuable groundwork for the forthcoming Vigil mission and enhancing preparedness for CME-driven space weather events.</description>

      <title>Origin of the stellar Fe K{\alpha} line clarified with FUV and X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence line diagnostics of the Fe K{\alpha} line at $\sim 6.4$ keV observed in both solar and stellar flares can constrain the latitude and size of the flare loop, even in the absence of imaging observations. However, they are hampered by the unresolved origin of stellar Fe K{\alpha} lines: i.e., it is unclear which of the two mechanisms-photoionization by hard X-ray photons or collisional ionization by non-thermal electrons-is the dominant process. We present clear evidence for the photoionization origin based on simultaneous far ultraviolet (FUV) and soft X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis with Extreme ultraviolet spetrosCope for ExosphEric Dynamic (EXCEED; 900$-$1480 \r{A}) onboard Hisaki and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV). The flare started at 22:50 UT on 2018 November 15 and released $2 \times 10^{36}$ erg in the 900$-$1480 \r{A} band and $3 \times 10^{36}$ erg in the 0.3$-$4 keV band. The FUV emission, a proxy for non-thermal activity, peaked approximately 1.4 hours before the soft X-rays. In contrast, the Fe K{\alpha} line, detected at a statistical significance of $5.3 \sigma$ with an equivalent width of $67^{+28}_{-20}$ eV, peaked simultaneously with the thermal X-ray maximum rather than the non-thermal FUV peak-strongly supporting the photoionization hypothesis. Radiative transfer calculations, combined with the observed Fe K{\alpha} line intensity, further support the photoionization scenario and demonstrate the potential of this line to provide the flare geometry.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Line Broadening: Modeling Stellar Spectra and Formation Temperatures at High Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of stellar spectra is pervasive in astronomy. Conventionally, the shapes of absorption lines are modeled by convolving thermal profiles (computed given some model stellar atmosphere and line list) with broadening kernels intended to account for the effects of rotation and other nonthermal sources of broadening (i.e., macroturbulence). Here, we show that the assumptions that permit this convolution can break down at high spectral resolution and produce appreciable errors in the modeled flux. We then consider the effects of rotation, microturbulence, and macroturbulence on the intensity and flux contribution functions, which astronomers use to map individual spectral segments to quasi-physical formation ``locations'' in the stellar atmosphere. We show that proper consideration of 1) the distinction between intensity and flux and 2) the inclusion of rotation and macroturbulence in the contribution function can dramatically change the modeled formation temperatures. To complement this analysis, we provide a package -- FormationTemperatures.jl -- which quickly computes model line contribution functions and formation parameters given bulk stellar properties as input. In closing, we emphasize the assumptions inherent to this analysis, consider in which regimes the convolution expression for flux should be avoided, and caution how the concept of a singular ``formation temperature'' can oversimplify some realities of radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>Centrally concentrated star formation in young clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05016v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer-like density profile. However, most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch} framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into \texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics. We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of $0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) the final stellar density profile is more centrally concentrated than analytically predicted, reflecting the role of global gas collapse and feedback; (2) sub-clusters can initially form even in centrally concentrated gas clouds; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models of local fragmentation and star formation; and (4) the mass of the most massive star formed is directly correlated with the cluster effective radius and inversely correlated with the velocity dispersion, while the duration of star formation correlates with the star formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and physical structure of Ou 5: A bipolar planetary nebula with extreme abundance discrepancy and an eclipsing binary core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new deep imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of the extreme-abundance-discrepancy planetary nebula Ou 5, together with photoionization modelling aimed at probing its unusual thermal and chemical structure. The nebula exhibits a nested bipolar morphology, including inner and outer shells, faint outer lobes, and polar knots. Remarkably, all these components share a dynamical age of order 10,000 yr. Thermal broadening of the H alpha line relative to heavier ions implies a hydrogen temperature 3000 K to 6000 K, in contrast to the ~ 10,000 K derived from collisionally excited line diagnostics. This provides independent support for the presence of at least two distinct temperature/metallicity phases, as previously proposed to explain extreme abundance discrepancies. Photoionization models with sinusoidally varying metallicity successfully reproduce the observed nebular spectrum and morphology. A mixture of fluctuations with both extreme and moderate metallicity contrasts is required to simultaneously fit the O II and the [O III] observations. The nebular He II emission demands a hotter and more luminous central star than previously inferred, consistent with a ~ 0.58 solar mass post-AGB progenitor evolving toward a CO white dwarf. Ou 5 thus reinforces the link between close-binary nuclei and extreme abundance discrepancies, and provides a valuable benchmark for understanding how common-envelope ejections give rise to the thermal and abundance inhomogeneities observed in planetary nebulae.</description>

      <title>Double tidal disruption events or repeating partial tidal disruption events in AT 2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AT 2020vdq has been known as a candidate of repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs), due to its two flares with a time interval of $\sim$1000 days. Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $\beta$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\rm M_\odot}$ and $0.36{\rm M_\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $\beta$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Analysis Of The Galactic Open Clusters' Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of 1,481 Galactic open clusters (OCs) through the application of the Limepy dynamical model, from which we derive the fundamental structural parameters of OCs. We conduct the statistical analyses on the structural parameters with clusters' ages and locations within the Milky Way. Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location.</description>

      <title>CASCADE: Filamentary accretion flows in Cygnus X DR20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds.</description>

      <title>Age, Chemistry, and Kinematics of the Inner Galaxy Revealed by MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bar/bulge and inner disk are fundamental building blocks of the Milky Way, containing a large fraction of its stellar mass. However, stars in these regions are faint, crowded, and have high extinction, which makes studying their formation and evolution challenging. Using the integral-field spectrograph MUSE with adaptive-optics on the Very Large Telescope, we overcome these limitations and measure accurate ages, chemical abundances, and line-of-sight velocities for 98 main-sequence turn-off and subgiant branch stars with $R_{gc}&lt;3.5$ kpc in Baade's Window. We find that 17% stars have ages younger than 5 Gyr, and the age distribution reveals multiple peaks at 3.1, 4.8, 7.6, and 10.8 Gyr, indicating that star formation in the inner Galaxy occurred in multiple episodes. These stars are predominantly metal-rich but span a broad metallicity range ($-1.2&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.6$). The [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution shows both $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor sequences, with most stars being metal-rich and low-[$\alpha$/Fe]. Our results demonstrate that IFUs enable reliable measurements of stellar parameters even in the most crowded regions of the Milky Way, opening a new pathway to study the chemodynamical evolution of the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Improving the inference of the stellar quantities using the extended $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\chi_S&lt;0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.</description>

      <title>WASP-12, shrouded in mystery or just cold gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the planet-hosting star WASP-12 show a distinctive depression in the \ion{Mg}{ii} and \ion{Ca}{ii} resonance lines. This has been interpreted as a marker of atmospheric loss from the close-in hot Jupiter WASP-12b and the resulting formation of a gas torus around the star. In this paper we quantify the \ion{Mg}{ii} absorption from this torus, compared to that provided by the stellar wind, the stellar astrosphere and the ISM. To do this we piece together the full density profile of \ion{Mg}{ii} from WASP-12 to an observer on Earth using a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and observations. We find that the bulk of the gas along the line of sight is contained within a dense torus close to WASP-12. However, the temperatures in this torus are sufficient to promote Mg into a doubly (\ion{Mg}{iii}) or higher ionized state. As a result, the singly ionized fraction (\ion{Mg}{ii}) is low. We find that most of the \ion{Mg}{ii} is not in the torus but in the ISM. Despite this, the total column density of \ion{Mg}{ii} is two orders of magnitude lower than required to explain observations of the system. To resolve this discrepancy, we note that the torus gas is at a temperature where it will cool efficiently. We speculate that the onset of the cooling instability will cause the torus to fragment, forming cold clumps with a higher fraction of \ion{Mg}{ii}, capable of explaining the observed absorption.</description>

      <title>Accretion bottleneck in protoplanetary discs: the role of the stellar spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate angular momentum transport and accretion properties in a sample of protoplanetary discs with dynamical measurements of stellar masses, disc masses, and scale radii. From these data we infer effective $\alpha$-viscosities, finding a remarkably broad range spanning over three orders of magnitude. This spread correlates with the stellar rotation period: systems with shorter periods exhibit significantly lower accretion rates, suggesting that they are undergoing at least temporary episodes of accretion bottleneck. We interpret this behaviour within the framework of magnetospheric accretion models, where the transition between steady accretion and the propeller regime is set by the relative locations of the co-rotation and magnetospheric radii. Our results indicate that stellar spin is a key parameter in regulating mass transfer from the disc to the star, and provide new evidence that the observed dispersion in $\alpha$ reflects transitions between distinct accretion states rather than differences in global disc properties.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Bath in a Past Supernova Gives Birth to Earth-Like Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic fields pervade astrophysical systems and strongly influence their dynamics. Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Distant Milky Way Halo RR Lyrae Stars out to 160 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kinematical study of the outer halo (r_GC approximately 60 to 160 kpc) of the Milky Way based on spectroscopy of 55 RR Lyrae stars obtained with the ESI instrument on the Keck II telescope. Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment of metal-poor stars orbiting massive black hole companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description>

      <title>Predictions of gravity mode pulsations of collisional blue straggler stars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars (BSSs) are exotic objects, which, being the results of processes such as mass transfer, mergers, or collisions, are considered key objects in the study of their host clusters' dynamics. While many studies on astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of BSSs in clusters have been conducted, there are few works in the literature regarding their pulsations and internal structure, which can indeed retain traces of their origin. In this work we computed and analysed a grid of collisional BSSs at low metallicity ($Z = 0.01\; Z_\odot$), finding that collision products present a peculiar chemical stratification that leads to periodicities in the period-spacing pattern of high-order gravity modes. These seismic fingerprints provide a unique opportunity to constrain the formation pathways of BSSs in globular clusters.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~$10^5$ transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, $Q^{'}_{*}$, of $10^6$, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of $Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3}$ and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614-3329</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614-3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Electron-capture Supernovae: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed ~45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars II: Starspots and obliquities of Kepler-17 and Kepler-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show active latitudes: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).</description>
