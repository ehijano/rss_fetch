      <title>The TOI-1117 Multi-planetary System: 3 sub-Neptunes, 1 in both the Neptunian Desert and Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of three sub-Neptune planets around TOI-1117, a Sun-like star with mass $0.97\pm0.02M_{\odot}$, radius $1.05\pm0.03R_{\odot}$, age $4.42\pm1.50$ Gyr and effective temperature $5635\pm62$ K. Light curves from TESS and LCOGT show a transiting sub-Neptune with a $2.23$ day period, mass $M_b=8.90_{-0.96}^{+0.95}M_{\oplus}$ and radius $R_b=2.46_{-0.12}^{+0.13}R_{\oplus}$. This is a rare 'hot Neptune' that falls within the parameter spaces known as the 'Neptunian Desert' and the 'Radius Valley'. Two more planetary signals are detected in HARPS radial velocities, revealing two non-transiting planets with minimum masses $M_c=7.46_{-1.62}^{+1.43}M_{\oplus}$ and $M_d=9.06_{-1.78}^{+2.07}M_{\oplus}$, and periods of $4.579\pm0.004$ and $8.67\pm0.01$ days. The eccentricities were poorly constrained by the HARPS data, with upper limits $e_b=0.11$, $e_c=0.29$, and $e_d=0.24$. However, dynamical simulations of the TOI-1117 system, suggest that the orbits must be nearly circular to be stable. The simulations also show that TOI-1117b and c are likely to be in a near 2:1 resonance. The multi-planet nature of TOI-1117 makes it a more complex case for formation theories of the Neptunian Desert and Radius Valley, as current theories such as high-eccentricity migration are too turbulent to produce a stable, non-eccentric, multi-planet system. Moreover, analysis of TOI-1117b's photoevaporation history found rocky core and H/He atmosphere models to be inconsistent with observations, whilst water-rich scenarios were favoured.</description>

      <title>DART-Vetter: A Deep LeARning Tool for automatic triage of exoplanet candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future, the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal, featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters, showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) &gt; 20 and orbital period &lt; 50 days.</description>

      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Evidence of planet-disk interaction in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architectures of exoplanet systems are likely set during the initial planet-formation phase in the circumstellar disk. To understand this process, we have to study the earliest phases of planet formation. Complex sub-structures, believed to be driven by embedded planets, have been detected in a significant portion of disks observed at high angular resolution. We aim to extend the sample of such disks to low stellar masses and to connect the disk morphology to the expected proto-planet properties.
  We resolve the disk in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system for the first time in scattered near-infrared light on scales of 10 au using VLT/SPHERE and reveal an exceptionally structured disk. We find an inner disk (inside 40 au) with two spiral arms, separated by a gap from an outer ring. By comparison with hydrodynamic models, we find that these structures are consistent with the presence of an embedded gas giant with a mass range between 0.1 and 5 MJup depending on the employed model. Our SPHERE observations find a tentative candidate point source within the disk gap, which may be consistent with this mass range if it indeed traces thermal emission by an embedded planet. This interpretation is somewhat strengthened by the proximity of this signal to compact mm continuum emission in the disk gap, which may trace circumplanetary material. It is, however, unclear if this tentative companion candidate could be responsible for the observed disk gap size, given its close proximity to the inner disk.
  The 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system is one of only a few systems that shows this exceptional morphology of spiral arms located inside a scattered light gap and ring. We speculate that this may have to do with a higher disk viscosity compared with other systems such as PDS 70.</description>

      <title>Venus Cloud Research: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus has regained attention on the international stage with the approval of three new missions by ESA and NASA. As the twin sister of Earth, Venus exhibits a distinct atmosphere, which casts a veil of mystery over the planetary evolution and is of great scientific significance. One of the most important components of Venus-the cloud-is believed to have significantly regulated its climate evolution and affect the environmental habitability. However, due to sparse in-situ measurements and the limitation of remote sensing, properties of these clouds remain largely unknown. Based on research conducted in past decades, this article reviews the observational structure of cloud properties, the progress of microphysical and simplified cloud model developments, and perspectives of future directions of this research field. Several possible solutions to the challenges associated with the coupling effect, ultraviolet absorption, and habitability are proposed and discussed in details, providing insights for future Venus' explorations.</description>

      <title>TOI-2407 b: a warm Neptune in the desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the validation of TOI-2407 b, a warm Neptune-sized planet with a radius of 4.26 $\pm$ 0.26 R$_\oplus$, orbiting an early M-type star with a period of 2.7 days and an equilibrium temperature of 705 $\pm$ 12 K. The planet was identified by TESS photometry and validated in this work through multi-wavelength ground-based follow-up observations. We include an observation with the novel CMOS-based infrared instrument SPIRIT at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory. The high-precision transit data enabled by CMOS detectors underscore their potential for improving the detection and characterisation of exoplanets orbiting M-dwarfs, particularly in the infrared, where these stars emit most of their radiation. TOI-2407 b lies within the boundaries of the period-radius Neptune desert, an apparent scarcity of Neptune-sized planets at short orbits. Further characterisation of TOI-2407 b, such as radial velocity measurements, will refine its position within planetary demographic trends. This system also provides a comparison case for the well-studied Neptune-sized planet Gliese 436 b, of similar radius, period and stellar type. Comparison studies could aid the understanding of the formation and evolution of Neptune-like planets around M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Overestimating Sigma Significances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomers, and in particular exoplaneteers, have a curious habit of expressing Bayes factors as frequentist sigma values. This is of course completely unnecessary and arguably rather ill-advised. Regardless, the practice is common - especially in the detection claims of chemical species within exoplanet atmospheres. The current canonical conversion strategy stems from a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound on the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the $p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\sigma}$). A common practice within the exoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going from a Bayes factor to $n_\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke &amp; Seager (2013) -- a highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of inferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to calibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013 was more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally noted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on $n_\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in inflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the community to stop converting to $n_\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes factors.</description>

      <title>The TESS Ten Thousand Catalog: 10,001 uniformly-vetted and -validated Eclipsing Binary Stars detected in Full-Frame Image data by machine learning and analyzed by citizen scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30 minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and -validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).</description>

      <title>Comparing observations of the closely located JUICE and STEREO-A spacecraft during the widespread solar energetic particle event of 2024 May 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JUICE was launched in April 2023, and it is now in its cruise phase to Jupiter, where it is scheduled to arrive in July 2031. JUICE carries a radiation monitor, namely the RADiation hard Electron Monitor (RADEM) to measure protons, electrons, and ions, detecting particles coming mainly from the anti-Sun direction. On 2024 May 13, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event took place in association with an eruption close to the western limb of the Sun as seen from Earth. Providentially, at that time JUICE was located very close to STEREO-A, being separated by 0.13 au in radial distance, 0.3 deg in latitude, and 1.6 deg in longitude. Methods. We analysed the IP context using in-situ measurements and studied the proton anisotropies measured by near-Earth spacecraft and STEREO-A. We focused on an isotropic period during the decay phase of the SEP event to compute the proton energy spectrum. We fit the STEREO-A spectrum and compared it to that measured by SOHO and JUICE. Conclusions. The RADEM instrument aboard JUICE is a valuable tool for measuring SEP events in the heliosphere, providing an excellent opportunity to study and characterise the energetic particle environment in the solar wind between 0.65 and 5.2 au. The intercalibration factors between the fluxes measured by STEREO-A and JUICE at the effective energies of 6.9 MeV, 13.3 MeV, 21.6 MeV, and 31.2 MeV are 1.02, 1.23, 1.12, and 0.95 respectively. These intercalibration factors are valid only until 2024 July 10, when the configuration of the RADEM instrument was changed.</description>

      <title>Peculiar rainbows in Saturn's E ring: Uncovering luminous bands near Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of stripe-like features in Enceladus' plumes captured simultaneously by Cassini's VIMS-IR and ISS NAC instruments during flyby E17, with similar patterns seen in VIMS-IR data from flyby E13 and E19. These parallel stripes, inclined at approximately 16$^{\circ}$ to the ecliptic and 43$^{\circ}$ to Saturn's ring plane, appear continuous across images when projected in the J2000 frame. A bright stripe, most visible at wavelengths around 5 $\mu$m, acts as the zeroth-order diffraction peak of a reflection grating with an estimated groove spacing of 0.12$-$2.60 mm, while adjacent stripes are attributed to higher-order diffraction peaks. We suggest that this light-dispersing phenomenon originates from an inclined periodic structure within Saturn's E ring. This structure, constrained between Saturn's G ring and Rhea's orbit, likely consists of fresh ice particles supplied by Enceladus' plumes.</description>

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light reveal essential insights into the disk's three-dimensional architecture and dust properties. These disks, which play a crucial role in planet formation, have complex structures where the visibility of the disk's backside can vary significantly based on several parameters. This study aims to explore the factors impacting backside visibility in protoplanetary disks, particularly under variations in inclination, dust distribution, grain characteristics, and outer disk morphology. Using RADMC-3D radiative transfer simulations, we investigate how these variables influence the appearance of the backside in scattered light images. Tapered disk models with exponential tapers, frequently obscure the backside, which supports the rarity of observed backside features. In cases where backside features are visible at lower inclinations, they likely indicate cut-off disks, as backside detection is challenging in standard tapered models at these inclinations. Additionally, factors like dust mass, grain distribution, and disk material stratification play crucial roles in backside observability, affecting its potential detection in real observations. This study contributes to understanding the detectability of the backside in protoplanetary disks, with implications for refining observational strategies and interpreting backside features in scattered light images. These findings help frame backside visibility as a critical aspect of assessing disk structure and evolution.</description>
