      <title>On 4D, ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ deformed vector multiplets and partial supersymmetry breaking in off-shell supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic Fayet-Ilioupulous (FI) terms are used to engineer partial breaking of ${\mathcal{N}=2}$ global supersymmetry for systems of vector multiplets. The magnetic FI term induces a deformation of the off-shell field transformations associated with an imaginary constant shift of the triplet of auxiliary fields of the vector multiplet. In this paper, we elaborate on the deformation of off-shell vector multiplets in supergravity, both in components and superspace. In a superconformal framework, the deformations are associated with (composite) linear multiplets. We engineer an off-shell model that exhibits partial local supersymmetry breaking with a zero cosmological constant. This is based on the hyper-dilaton Weyl multiplet introduced in arXiv:2203.12203, coupled to the SU(1,1)/U(1) special-K\"ahler sigma model in a symplectic frame admitting a holomorphic prepotential, with one compensating and one physical vector multiplet, the latter magnetically deformed.</description>

      <title>Subsystem entropy in 2d CFT and KdV ETH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study subsystem entropy in 2d CFTs, for subsystems constituting a finite fraction of the full system. We focus on the extensive contribution, which scales linearly with the subsystem size in the thermodynamic limit. We employ the so-called diagonal approximation to evaluate subsystem entropy for the chaotic CFTs in thermal state (canonical ensemble), microcanonical ensemble, and in a primary state, matching previously known results. We then proceed to find analytic expressions for the subsystem entropy at leading order in $c$, when the global CFT state is the KdV generalized Gibbs ensemble or the KdV microcanonical ensemble. Previous studies of primary eigenstates have shown that, akin to fixed-area states in AdS/CFT, corresponding subsystem entanglement spectrum is flat. This behavior is seemingly in sharp contradiction with the one for the thermal (microcanonical) state, and thus in apparent contradiction with the subsystem Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). In this work, we resolve this issue by comparing the primary state with the KdV (micro)canonical ensemble. We show that the results are consistent with the KdV-generalized version of the subsystem ETH, in which local properties of quantum eigenstates are governed by their values of conserved KdV charges. Our work solidifies evidence for the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs and emphasizes Renyi entropy as a sensitive probe of the reduced-density matrix.</description>

      <title>String perturbation theory of Klebanov-Strassler throat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a tool to study string perturbation theory of the Klebanov-Strassler solution in the large radius approximation based on open-closed superstring field theory. Combining the large radius expansion and a double scaling limit, we find a perturbative background solution of open-closed superstring field theory that corresponds to the Klebanov-Strassler solution. To illustrate the utilities of this approach, we break supersymmetry of the background by placing a stack of anti-D3-branes at the tip of the throat. We then find a perturbative open string background solution to the third order in the large radius approximation, which agrees with the well-known supergravity analysis of Kachru-Pearson-Verlinde (KPV) on the stability of the antiD3-brane supersymmetry breaking. The perturbative background solution to the open string field theory we found is expected to be dual to an NS5-brane probing the KS solution.</description>

      <title>Toda field theories and Calogero models associated to infinite Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many integrable theories can be formulated universally in terms of Lie algebraic root systems. Well-studied are conformally invariant scalar field theories of Toda type and their massive versions, which can be expressed in terms of simple roots of finite Lie and affine Kac-Moody algebras, respectively. Also, multi-particle systems of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland type, which require the entire root system in their formulation, are extensively studied. Here, we discuss recently proposed extensions of these models to similar systems based on hyperbolic and Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. We explore various properties of these models, including their integrability and their invariance with respect to infinite Weyl groups of affine, hyperbolic, and Lorentzian types.</description>

      <title>More About the Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work arXiv:2311.09334, we introduced a lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$ using staggered Majorana fermions. We found the gauge invariant space of states explicitly for the gauge group $\text{SU}(2)$ and used them for numerical calculations of observables, such as the spectrum and the expectation value of the fermion bilinear. In this paper, we carry out a more in-depth study of our lattice model, extending it to any compact and simply-connected gauge group $G$. We show how to find the gauge invariant space of states and use it to study various observables. We also use the lattice model to calculate the mixed 't Hooft anomalies of Adjoint QCD$_2$ for arbitrary $G$. We show that the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols of $G$. For $G = \text{SU}(3)$, we perform exact diagonalization for lattices of up to six sites and study the low-lying spectrum, the fermion bilinear condensate, and the string tension. We also show how to write the lattice strong coupling expansion for ground state energies and operator expectation values in terms of the Wigner 6$j$-symbols. For $\text{SU}(3)$ we carry this out explicitly and find good agreement with the exact diagonalizations, and for $\text{SU}(4)$ we give expansions that can be compared with future numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Moduli stabilization and light axion by Siegel modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the stabilization of multiple moduli by utilizing Siegel modular forms in the framework of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$ modular invariant theories. We derive the stationary conditions at CP-conserving fixed points for a generic modular- and CP-invariant scalar potential. The stabilization of multiple moduli is explicitly demonstrated in $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ and $Sp(6,\mathbb{Z})$ modular invariant scalar potentials. Furthermore, it turns out that there exists a light axion when the moduli are stabilized nearby a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Holographic Renyi entropies in KdV generalized ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in chaotic two dimensional CFTs is subtle due to infinitely many conserved KdV charges. Previous works have demonstrated that primary CFT eigenstates have flat entanglement spectrum, which is very different from the microcanonical ensemble. This result is an apparent contradiction to conventional ETH, which does not take KdV charges into account. In a companion paper \cite{KdVETHgeneral}, we resolve this discrepancy by studying the subsystem entropy of a chaotic CFT in KdV-generalized Gibbs and microcanonical ensembles. In this paper, we carry out parallel computations in the context of AdS/CFT. We focus on the high density limit, which is equivalent to thermodynamic limit in conformal theories. In this limit holographic Renyi entropy can be computed using the so-called gluing construction. We explicitly study the the KdV-generalized microcanonical ensembles with the densities of the first two KdV charges $\langle \mathcal{Q}_1\rangle = q_1,\langle \mathcal{Q}_3\rangle = q_3$ fixed and obeying $q_3-q_1^2 \ll q_1^2$. In this regime we found that the refined Renyi entropy $\tilde{S}_n$ is $n$-independent for $n&gt;n_{cut}$, where $n_{cut}$ depends on $q_1,q_3$. By taking the primary state limit $q_3\to q_1^2$, we recover the flat entanglement spectrum characteristic of fixed-area states, and in agreement with the primary state behavior. This provides a consistency check of the KdV-generalized ETH in 2d CFTs.</description>

      <title>Conformality loss and short-range crossover in long-range conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformality loss of theories with long-range interactions. We consider the $O(2)\times O(N)$ multiscalar model with coupling $r^{-d-\delta}$ in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimension. We compute the critical exponents of the long-range fixed points (LRFPs) to three loops. The phase diagram of the model is dominated by two processes: the short-range crossover and merger-annihilation of LRFPs. The two processes intersect at the lower edge of the conformal window, below which the LRFPs disappear into the complex plane. We propose a novel scenario for the short-range crossover of complex LRFPs, in which the short-range crossover occurs on a vertical line in the complex plane of $\delta$. The complex marginal operator generates renormalization group flow on the transition line and significantly enriches the short-range crossover of complex LRFPs.</description>

      <title>Spacetime aspects of non-supersymmetric strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistency of string theory as a theory of gravity does not rely on the presence of spacetime supersymmetry; however, its absence leads to the emergence of tadpole diagrams in the on-shell worldsheet formulation, thus undermining our control over the physics. Two-dimensional conformal invariance, a pillar of string theory, requires tadpole subtraction through the Fischler-Susskind mechanism, whose spacetime consequence is the emergence of scalar tadpole potentials. In this thesis, I explore several implications of the absence of supersymmetry in string-derived scenarios. I focus on the three ten-dimensional tachyon-free string theories in which spacetime supersymmetry is absent or broken, studying the gravitational consequences of tadpole potentials. First, I address vacuum solutions in terms of singular codimension-one vacua, explore their generalizations, and discuss the properties of their singular boundaries. I present an alternative perspective on these vacua based on the formalism of fake supersymmetry, in which the second-order equations of motion are replaced by supersymmetry-like first-order equations. I then turn to the topic of engineering vacua in the non-supersymmetric string models by constructing solutions that are supported by electric and magnetic fluxes and by providing evidence for their instability. Finally, I investigate brane-like solutions in the presence of tadpole potentials that yield both flux vacua with the isometries of supersymmetric branes and gravitational profiles that capture the backreaction of localized sources.</description>

      <title>Modularity of Vafa-Witten Partition Functions from SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6d (2,0) theory of $N$ M5 branes compactified on the product geometry $T^2\times S$, where $S$ is a K\"ahler 4-manifold, can be studied in two different limits. In one limit, the size of $T^2$ is taken to zero and together with a topological twist one arrives at the Vafa-Witten partition function on $S$. On the other hand, taking the size of $S$ to zero leads to a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ theory. This gives rise to a 2d-4d correspondence where the Vafa-Witten partition functions are identified with the characters of the 2d theory. In this paper, we test this conjecture for Hirzebruch and Del Pezzo surfaces by employing the technique of SymTFT to show that the modular transformation properties of the two sides match. Moreover, we construct modular invariant 2d absolute partition functions and verify that they are invariant under gauging of a discrete symmetry at the self-dual point in coupling space. This provides further hints for the presence of duality defects in the 2d SCFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the double copy of the chiral higher-spin theory. It is a Lorentz invariant theory with the little group spectrum given by the tensor square of the chiral higher-spin theory spectrum. Moreover, its interactions factorise in close analogy with the way interactions factorise in lower-spin double-copy theories. We also propose theories, which can be viewed as products of self-dual Yang-Mills theory, self-dual gravity and chiral higher-spin theories taken in different combinations and powers.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional Willmore energy as holographic entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin localized shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of AdS/CFT, gravitational shockwaves serve as a geometric manifestation of boundary quantum chaos. We study this connection in general diffeomorphism-invariant theories involving an arbitrary number of bosonic fields. Specifically, we demonstrate that theories containing spin-2 or higher-spin fields generally admit classical localized shockwave solutions on black hole backgrounds, whereas spin-0 and spin-1 theories do not. As in the gravitational case, these higher-spin shockwaves provide a means to compute the out-of-time-order correlator. Both the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity are found to universally agree with predictions from pole skipping. In particular, higher-spin fields lead to a Lyapunov exponent that violates the chaos bound and a butterfly velocity that may exceed the speed of light.</description>

      <title>T-duality on Almost Hermitian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate T-duality transformation on an almost bi-hermitian space with torsion. By virtue of the Buscher rule, we completely describe not only the covariant derivative of geometrical objects but also the Nijenhuis tensor. We apply this description to string sigma model whose target space is a T-dualized system from an integrable bi-hermitian space with isometry. We find that hermiticity is not a sufficient condition to preserve integrability under T-duality transformations. However, in the presence of the K\"{a}hler condition, the T-dualized almost complex structures keep integrable even though they become no longer covariantly constant. We also observe that the form of $H$-flux is suitable for string compactification scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify a one-parameter family, $\mathfrak{confcarr}_z(d+1)$, of conformal extensions of the Carroll algebra in arbitrary dimension with $z$ being the anisotropic scaling exponent. We further obtain their infinite-dimensional extensions, $\widetilde{\mathfrak{confcarr}}_z(d+1)$, and discuss their corresponding finite-dimensional truncated subalgebras when the scaling exponent is integer or half-integer. For all these conformal extensions, we also constrain the 2-point and 3-point correlation functions with electric and/or magnetic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between four dimensional $SO(4)$ pure Yang-Mills theory and the gravity is discussed. The functional integral for Yang-Mills theory is rewritten in terms of the gravity metric and Riemann tensors. This relation is shown to provide also a simple way to derive the linear potential resulting from the average Wilson loop in the pure Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG flows and Janus interfaces from ISO(3)xU(1) F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to four vector multiplets with a non-semisimple $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity arises from a consistent truncation of type IIB string theory on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface. We find that the gauged supergravity admit three $SO(3)$ symmetric vacua given by $N=(1,1)$ supersymmetric $AdS_6$, non-supersymmetric $AdS_6$ and $dS_6$ geometries. We compute all scalar masses at all of these critical points and find that only the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacuum is stable. By truncating to $SO(3)\times U(1)$ and $SO(2)\times U(1)$ invariant sectors, we study holographic RG flow solutions from this critical point to a number of non-conformal phases of the dual $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions. Finally, we give some examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions describing conformal interfaces within the five-dimensional SCFT. All of these solutions provide first holographic results from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with non-semisimple gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general strategy to build three-dimensional gauge theories with four supercharges which enjoy a supersymmetry enhancement in the IR. The resulting IR SCFTs admit topological twists with particularly nice properties, as well as boundary rational chiral algebras such that the associated Modular Tensor Categories are controlled by the topological twist. The theories arise from a twisted circle compactification of four-dimensional theories of Argyres-Douglas type. We develop a novel algorithm to compute or manipulate protected quantities associated to these theories, such as ellipsoid partition functions and superconformal indices and half-indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the microscopic formulation of Landauer's principle, when information is deleted the Von Neumann entropy of the system gets reduced with a corresponding energy cost. Although within the same perspective the growth of the entropy should remain unconstrained we show that during quantum amplification the heat flow does restrict the increase of the Von Neumann entropy. When applied to the case of relic gravitons (with frequencies between the aHz region and the THz domain) the bounds obtained here set a limit on initial thermal gravitons and on the total duration of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using modern tools of relativistic quantum information, we compare entanglement of a free, massive scalar field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the cosmological patch of de Sitter spacetime with that in Minkowski spacetime. There is less entanglement between spatially localized field modes in de Sitter, despite the fact that there is more entanglement stored in the field on large scales. This shows that inflation does not produce entanglement between local observables.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>Feynman integral reduction: balanced reconstruction of sparse rational functions and implementation on supercomputers in a co-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction is one of the essential steps in evaluating Feynman integrals. A modern approach to IBP reduction uses modular arithmetic evaluations with parameters set to numerical values at sample points, followed by reconstruction of the analytic rational coefficients. Due to the large number of sample points needed, problems at the frontier of science require an application of supercomputers. In this article, we present a rational function reconstruction method that fully takes advantage of sparsity, combining the balanced reconstruction method and the Zippel method. Additionally, to improve the efficiency of the finite-field IBP reduction runs, at each run several numerical probes are computed simultaneously, which allows to decrease the resource overhead. We describe what performance issues one encounters on the way to an efficient implementation on supercomputers, and how one should co-design the algorithm and the supercomputer infrastructure. Benchmarks are presented for IBP reductions for massless two-loop four- and five-point integrals using a development version of FIRE, as well as synthetic examples mimicking the coefficients involved in scattering amplitudes for post-Minkowskian gravitational binary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cyclic random graph models predicting giant molecules in hydrocarbon pyrolysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrocarbon pyrolysis is a complex chemical reaction system at extreme temperature and pressure conditions involving large numbers of chemical reactions and chemical species. Only two kinds of atoms are involved: carbons and hydrogens. Its effective description and predictions for new settings are challenging due to the complexity of the system and the high computational cost of generating data by molecular dynamics simulations. On the other hand, the ensemble of molecules present at any moment and the carbon skeletons of these molecules can be viewed as random graphs. Therefore, an adequate random graph model can predict molecular composition at a low computational cost. We propose a random graph model featuring disjoint loops and assortativity correction and a method for learning input distributions from molecular dynamics data. The model uses works of Karrer and Newman (2010) and Newman (2002) as building blocks. We demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the size distribution for small molecules as well as the size distribution of the largest molecule in reaction systems at the pressure of 40.5 GPa, temperature range of 3200K-5000K, and H/C ratio range from 2.25 as in octane through 4 as in methane.</description>

      <title>Violating Lorentz invariance minimally by the emergence of nonmetricity? A Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance belongs to the fundamental symmetries of nature. It is basic for the successful Standard Model of Particle Physics. Nevertheless, within the last decades, Lorentz invariance has been repeatedly questioned. In fact, there exist different research programs addressing this problem. We argue that a most adequate understanding of a possible violation of Lorentz invariance is achieved in the framework of the gauge-theoretic approach to gravity: a non-vanishing nonmetricity of a metric-affine geometry of spacetime heralds the violation of the Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity and factorial moment scaling in the symmetry broken phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for remnants of the QCD chiral critical point is a central objective of current and future high-energy ion collision experiments. Previous studies suggest that a scaling law relating higher-order factorial moments of hadron multiplicity fluctuations to the second factorial moment could serve as a tool for detecting the QCD critical point. However, we demonstrate that this scaling law is not unique to critical phenomena. Instead, it emerges as a general property of distributions by extending the concept of hypercontractivity, originally applied to ordinary moments, to factorial moments. We present examples of distribution classes that exhibit the same higher-order factorial moment scaling as multiplicity fluctuations in the symmetry-broken phase. This insight allows us to explain the recent intermittency analysis results from the STAR experiment at RHIC (arXiv:2301.11062), where no indication of criticality was observed.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

Abstract: Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke predicted that the hyperk\"ahler Ooguri-Vafa space $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ should provide a local model for Hitchin moduli spaces near the discriminant locus. To this end, Tulli identified $\mathcal{M}^{\rm ov}$ with a certain space of framed Higgs bundles with an irregular singularity. We extend this result by identifying the Ooguri-Vafa holomorphic symplectic form with a regularized version of the Atiyah-Bott form on the associated space of framed connections. We also prove the analogous statement for the corresponding semiflat forms.</description>

      <title>Circular and drifted Rindler Unruh effects: Two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory, each stationary motion is associated with an effective, energy-dependent notion of temperature, which generalises the familiar Unruh temperature of uniform linear acceleration. Motivated by current experimental interest in circular motion, we analyse the effective temperature for drifted Rindler motion, generated by a boost and a spacelike translation (drift), and the way in which drifted Rindler motion can be smoothly deformed to circular motion through a third type of motion known as parator. For an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions, we establish analytic results in the limits of large gap, small gap and large drift speed. For fixed proper acceleration, the drifted Rindler temperature remains bounded in the large gap limit, in contrast to the circular motion temperature, which can be arbitrarily large in this limit. Finally, in 2+1 dimensions, we trace the vanishing of the circular motion temperature in the small gap limit to the weak decay of the Wightman function, and we show that, among all types of stationary motion in all dimensions, this phenomenon is unique to 2+1 dimensions and therein to circular and parator motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum hash function based on Gaussian boson sampling on a photonic quantum computer, aiming to provide quantum-resistant security. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this hash function exhibits strong properties of preimage, second preimage, and collision resistance, which are essential for cryptographic applications. Notably, the estimated number of attempts required for a successful collision attack increases exponentially with the mode counts of the photonic quantum computer, suggesting robust resistance against birthday attacks. We also analyze the sampling cost for physical implementation and discuss potential applications to blockchain technologies, where the inherent quantum nature of the hash computation could provide quantum-resistant security. The high dimensionality of the quantum state space involved in the hashing process poses significant challenges for quantum attacks, indicating a path towards quantum security. Our work lays the foundation for a new paradigm of quantum-resistant hashing with applications in emerging quantum-era information systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as comprehensive probes into our early Universe with associated generations of stochastic gravitational waves and superhorizon curvature perturbations or even primordial black holes. In characterizing the FOPT, phenomenological parameters like transition temperatures, strength factors, bubble separations, and energy budgets can be easily extracted from the macroscopic equilibrium features of the underlying particle physics models except for the terminal wall velocity of the bubble expansion, making it the last key parameter to be determined most difficultly due to the non-equilibrium nature of the microscopic transition model. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent approach to calculate the bubble wall velocity by two fundamental conservation equations in the first-order hydrodynamics from not only the usual energy-momentum tensor but also the number density current in terms of a few phenomenological parameters from field theory.</description>

Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the aim of producing significant number of primordial black holes, over the past few years, there has been a considerable interest in examining models of inflation involving a single, canonical field, that permit a brief period of ultra slow roll. Earlier, we had examined inflationary magnetogenesis - achieved by breaking the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action through a coupling to the inflation - in situations involving departures from slow roll. We had found that a transition from slow roll to ultra slow roll inflation can lead to a strong blue tilt in the spectrum of the magnetic field over small scales and also considerably suppress its strength over large scales. In this work, we consider the scenario of pure ultra slow roll inflation and show that scale invariant magnetic fields can be obtained in such situations with the aid of a non-conformal coupling function that depends on the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Apart from the power spectrum, an important probe of the primordial magnetic fields are the three-point functions, specifically, the cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields. We calculate the three-point cross-correlation between the curvature perturbations and the magnetic fields in pure ultra slow roll inflation for the new choice of the non-conformal coupling function. In particular, we examine the validity of the consistency condition that is expected to govern the three-point function in the squeezed limit and comment on the wider implications of the results we obtain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate Floquet time-evolution of a truncated SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory on a two-leg ladder geometry under open boundary conditions using IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. To this end, we derive the quantum spin representation of the lattice Yang-Mills theory, and compose a quantum circuit carefully tailored to hard wares, reducing the use of CZ gates. Since it is still challenging to simulate Hamiltonian evolution in present noisy quantum processors, we make the step size in the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition very large, and simulate thermalization dynamics in Floquet circuit composed of the Suzuki-Trotter evolution. We demonstrate that IBM's Heron quantum processor can simulate, by error mitigation, Floqeut thermalization dynamics in a large system consisting of $62$ qubits. Our work would be a benchmark for further quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories using real devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the real corrections to the impact factor for the production of a forward Higgs boson, retaining full top-mass dependence. We demonstrate that the rapidity divergence is the one predicted by the BFKL factorization and perform the explicit subtraction in the BFKL scheme. We show that the IR-structure of the impact factor is the expected one and that, in the infinite-top-mass approximation, the previously known result is recovered. We also verify that the impact factor vanishes when the transverse momenta of the $t$-channel Reggeon goes to zero, in agreement with its gauge-invariant definition, exploiting the $m_t \rightarrow \infty$ expansion up to the next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the interior spacetime of stars is built in a Lorentz symmetry breaking model called bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we calculated the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this context of modified gravity. Then we show that the bumblebee field, responsible for the symmetry breaking, increases the star mass-radius relation when it assumes its vacuum expectation value. When compared to the general relativity mass-radius relation, a Lorentz symmetry breaking context, like the bumblebee gravity, could provide more massive stars, surpassing the $2.5 M_{\odot}$ limit as the interior of the star is described by quark matter with the MIT bag model.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Hidden Patterns: Approximate Resurgent Resummation from Truncated Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze truncated series generated as divergent formal solutions of non-linear ordinary differential equations. Motivating the study is a specific non-linear, first-order differential equation, which is the basis of the resurgent formulation of renormalized perturbation theory in quantum field theory. We use the Borel-Pad\'e approximant and classical analysis to determine the analytic structure of the solution using the first few terms of its asymptotic series. Afterward, we build an approximant, consistent with the resurgent properties of the equation. The procedure gives an approximate expression for the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the solution useful for practical applications. Connections with other physical applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Solving bound-state equations in $\text{QCD}_2$ with bosonic and fermionic quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bound-state equations (BSEs) in two-dimensional QCD in the $N_c\to \infty$ limit, viewed from both the infinite momentum frame (IMF) and the finite momentum frame (FMF). The BSE of a meson in the original 't Hooft model, {\it viz.}, spinor $\text{QCD}_2$ containing only fermionc quarks, has been extensively studied in literature. In this work, we focus on the BSEs pertaining to two types of ``exotic" hadrons, a ``tetraquark" which is composed of a bosonic quark and bosonic antiquark, and a ``baryon" which is composed of a bosonic antiquark and a fermionic quark. Utilizing the Hamiltonian approach, we derive the corresponding BSEs for both types of ``exotic" hadrons, from the perspectives of the light-front and equal-time quantization, and confirm the known results. The recently available BSEs for ``tetraquark" in FMF has also been recovered with the aid of the diagrammatic approach. For the first time we also present the BSEs of a ``baryon" in FMF in the extended 't Hooft model. By solving various BSEs numerically, we obtain the mass spectra pertaining to ``tetraquark" and ``baryon" and the corresponding bound-state wave functions of the lowest-lying states. It is numerically demonstrated that, when a ``tetraquark" or ``baryon" is continuously boosted, the forward-moving component of the bound-state wave function approaches the corresponding light-cone wave function, while the backward-moving component fades away.</description>

      <title>Doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states. These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling $2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a classification of $\mathcal{N} =2$ supersymmetric AdS$_4$ solutions of (massive) type IIA supergravity. The internal space is locally equipped with either an SU(2) or an identity structure. We focus on the SU(2) structure and determine the conditions it satisfies, dictated by supersymmetry. Imposing as an Ansatz that the internal space is complex, we reduce the problem of finding solutions to a Riccati ODE, which we solve analytically. We obtain in this fashion a large number of new families of solutions, both regular as well as with localized O8-planes and conical Calabi--Yau singularities. We also recover many solutions already discussed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.08989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze symmetries corresponding to separated topological sectors of 3d ${\cal} N=4$ gauge theories with Higgs vacua, compactified on a circle. The symmetries are encoded in Schwinger-Dyson identities satisfied by correlation functions of a certain gauge-invariant operator, the "vortex character." Such a character observable is realized as the vortex partition function of the 3d gauge theory, in the presence of a 1/2-BPS line defect. The character enjoys a double refinement, interpreted as a deformation of the usual characters of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras. We derive and interpret the Schwinger-Dyson identities for the 3d theory from various physical perspectives: in the 3d gauge theory itself, in a 1d gauged quantum mechanics, in 2d $q$-Toda theory, and in 6d little string theory. We establish the dictionary between all approaches. Lastly, we comment on the transformation properties of the vortex character under the action of three-dimensional Seiberg duality.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Flatness Nature of Noncommutative Minkowski Spacetime and the Singular Behavior of Probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is more than a century-old concept that the Minkowski spacetime is flat. From the pure geometric point of view, we explicitly address the issue of whether a noncommutative Minkowski spacetime is flat or not. In the framework of the twisted-diffeomorphism approach to noncommutative gravity with canonical type noncommutative (NC) coordinate structure, one important result that we get is that the NC Minkowski spacetime parametrized either with spherical polar coordinates or with parabolic coordinates has nontrivial NC corrections to Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor and curvature scalars. Another crucial result is that the curvature scalars have singular behavior at certain points, and these singularities are not coordinate singularities. The nature of these singularities clearly points towards the idea of high-energetic probes turning into black holes. The absence of any such noncommutative corrections, and thus any such singularities, in the cases of Cartesian coordinates and cylindrical coordinates leads to the conclusion that high-energetic probes do not turn into black holes when the canonical NC structure is considered for these coordinates.</description>

Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers presenting a new understanding of scattering amplitudes based on fundamentally combinatorial ideas in the kinematic space of the scattering data. We study the simplest theory of colored scalar particles with cubic interactions, at all loop orders and to all orders in the topological 't Hooft expansion. We find a novel formula for loop-integrated amplitudes, with no trace of the conventional sum over Feynman diagrams, but instead determined by a beautifully simple counting problem attached to any order of the topological expansion. These results represent a significant step forward in the decade-long quest to formulate the fundamental physics of the real world in a radically new language, where the rules of spacetime and quantum mechanics, as reflected in the principles of locality and unitarity, are seen to emerge from deeper mathematical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is part of a series of papers describing the new curve integral formalism for scattering amplitudes of the colored scalar tr$\phi^3$ theory. We show that the curve integral manifests a very surprising fact about these amplitudes: the dependence on the number of particles, $n$, and the loop order, $L$, is effectively decoupled. We derive the curve integrals at tree-level for all $n$. We then show that, for higher loop-order, it suffices to study the curve integrals for $L$-loop tadpole-like amplitudes, which have just one particle per color trace-factor. By combining these tadpole-like formulas with the the tree-level result, we find formulas for the all $n$ amplitudes at $L$ loops. We illustrate this result by giving explicit curve integrals for all the amplitudes in the theory, including the non-planar amplitudes, through to two loops, for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theories of relativistic Luttinger fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose relativistic Luttinger fermions as a new ingredient for the construction of fundamental quantum field theories. We construct the corresponding Clifford algebra and the spin metric for relativistic invariance of the action using the spin-base invariant formalism. The corresponding minimal spinor has 32 complex components, matching with the degrees of freedom of a standard-model generation including a right-handed neutrino. The resulting fermion fields exhibit a canonical scaling different from Dirac fermions and thus support the construction of novel relativistic and perturbatively renormalizable, interacting quantum field theories. In particular, new asymptotically free self-interacting field theories can be constructed, representing first examples of high-energy complete quantum field theories based on pure matter degrees of freedom. Gauge theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions exhibit a strong paramagnetic dominance, requiring large nonabelian gauge groups to maintain asymptotic freedom. We comment on the possibility to use Luttinger fermions for particle physics model building and the expected naturalness properties of such models.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ black hole cohomologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study new cohomologies for the BPS operators of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory with $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ gauge groups, to better understand the black hole microstates. We first study the index of these black hole operators and identify their apparent threshold levels. For $SU(3)$, we find many towers of states and partial no-hair behaviors. We explicitly construct the threshold cohomology in the $SU(3)$ theory. We study throughout this paper a subsector of the field theory corresponding to the BMN matrix theory. We also argue that the BMN sector exhibits a black hole like entropy growth at large $N$.</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Dirac theory from Lindbladian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between dissipative processes of open quantum systems and the non-Hermitian quantum field theory of relativistic fermionic systems. By examining the influence of dissipative effects on Dirac fermions via Lindblad formalism, we elucidate the effects of coupling relativistic Dirac particles with the environment and show the lack of manifest Lorentz invariance. Employing rigorous theoretical analysis, we generalize the collisionless Boltzmann equations for the relativistic dissipation-driven fermionic system and find the Lyapunov equation, which governs the stationary solutions. Using our formalism, one presents a simple non-Hermitian model that the relativistic fermionic particles and anti-particles are stable. Going further, using the solution to the Lyapunov equations, one analyses the effect of dissipation on the stationary charge imbalance of this non-Hermitian model and finds that the dissipation can induce a new kind of charge imbalance compared with the collisionless equilibrium case.</description>

Abstract: We explore mathematical relationship between holographic Wilsonian renormalization group(HWRG) and stochastic quantization(SQ) motivated by the similarity of the monotonicity in RG flow with Langevin dynamics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We look at scalar field theory in AdS space with its generic mass, self-interaction, and boundary deformation in the momentum space. Identifying the stochastic time $t$ with radial coordinate $r$ in AdS, we establish maps between the fictitious time evolution of stochastic multi point correlation function and the radial evolution of multi-trace deformation, which respectively, express the relaxation process of Langevin dynamics and holographic RG flow. We especially consider marginal multi-trace deformation on the AdS boundary which is successfully captured by a Langevin dynamics of SQ.</description>

      <title>Intermediate inflation in generalized non-minimal derivative coupling model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider intermediate inflation in context of the Generalized Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling (GNMDC) model. In this model, inflation is driven by a canonical scalar field that is coupled not only to gravity but also to the derivative of the scalar field. The GNMDC model introduces new dynamics and features during the inflationary epoch. We find inflationary solutions with a power law scalar field for the power law coupling function. Additionally, we determine the inflaton potential that generates intermediate expansion of the scale factor. We also discuss the background equations in the high friction limit and derive constraints on the parameters of our model. Furthermore, we investigate the cosmological perturbations in the slow roll approximation within the GNMDC model, We calculate the scalar and tensor spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio during the intermediate inflation. We compare the results of this model with the observational data that can be used to test the model using the cosmic microwave background radiation data. Overall, we establish conditions for the inflaton potential that ensure the continuation of accelerated expansion during the slow roll inflation. We numerically analyze the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes in intermediate inflation in the high friction limit. Moreover, we use the Planck 2018 data, to obtain constraints on the parameters of the model. We demonstrate that intermediate inflation in the GNMDC model is successful in evaluation and explanation of the background and perturbational quantities using observational data.</description>

      <title>Isospin precession in non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of pseudoclassical isospin is illustrated by the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect proposed by Wu and Yang in 1975. The spatial motion is free however the isospin precesses when the enclosed magnetic flux and the incoming particle's isosopin are not parallel. The non-Abelian phase factor $\mathfrak{F}$ of Wu and Yang acts on the isospin as an S-matrix. The scattering becomes side-independent when the enclosed flux is quantized, ${\Phi}_N=N\Phi_0$ with $N$ an integer. The gauge group $SU(2)$ is an internal symmetry and generates conserved charges only when the flux is quantized, which then splits into two series: for $N=2k$ $SU(2)$ acts trivially but for $N=1+2k$ the implementation is twisted. The orbital and the internal angular momenta are separately conserved. The double rotational symmetry is broken to $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ when $N$ odd. For unquantized flux there are no internal symmetries, the charge is not conserved and protons can be turned into neutrons.</description>

Abstract: The Poincar\'e symmetry can be contracted in two ways to yield the Galilei symmetry and the Carroll symmetry. The well-known Schr\"odinger equation exhibits the Galilei symmetry and is a fundamental equation in Galilean quantum mechanics. However, the question remains: what is the quantum equation that corresponds to the Carroll symmetry? In this paper, we derive a novel equation, called the ``Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation'', which describes the quantum dynamics in the Carrollian framework. We also construct the ``Carroll-Schr\"odinger algebra'', which is a conformal extension of the centrally extended Carroll algebra with a dynamical exponent of $z=1/2$. We show that this algebra is the symmetry algebra of the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation in two dimensions. Our results are then extended to arbitrary dimensions, and potential applications and extensions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the sparse SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Edge Modes and Entanglement in Maxwell Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work on black hole partition functions and entanglement entropy suggests the existence of "edge" degrees of freedom living on the (stretched) horizon. We identify a local and "shrinkable" boundary condition on the stretched horizon that gives rise to such degrees of freedom. They can be interpreted as the Goldstone bosons of gauge transformations supported on the boundary, with the electric field component normal to the boundary as their symplectic conjugate. Applying the covariant phase space formalism for manifolds with boundary, we show that both the symplectic form and Hamiltonian exhibit a bulk-edge split. We then show that the thermal edge partition function is that of a codimension-two ghost compact scalar living on the horizon. In the context of a de Sitter static patch, this agrees with the edge partition functions found by Anninos et al. in arbitrary dimensions. It also yields a 4D entanglement entropy consistent with the conformal anomaly. Generalizing to Proca theory, we find that the prescription of Donnelly and Wall reproduces existing results for its edge partition function, while its classical phase space does not exhibit a bulk-edge split.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

      <title>Triple Product Amplitude from Chiral String</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a worldsheet construction of a subset of triple product amplitudes proposed by Huang and Remmen (2022). We start with closed bosonic strings but left and right-moving momenta are not necessarily equal. Instead, they satisfy certain conditions. We called them section conditions. These conditions are generalizations of the section condition in double field theory. The vertex operators of chiral strings have nontrivial monodromy, so we interpret them as attached to the end of defects. In the calculation of the amplitude, we not only have to integrate over the moduli space, we also have to sum over different defect configurations. Unitarity and other consistency conditions for chiral string amplitudes are checked. We found the graviton amplitude, the Virasoro amplitude, and also a special kind of amplitude that has one infinite spin tower. Similar kinds of amplitude have appeared in bootstrap literature. The more general $N$-point amplitude could be obtained from a modified KLT relation. The five-point chiral string amplitude is also explicitly calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work out non-Lorentzian dual actions for electromagnetism and linearised gravity, both in the Carrollian and Galilean cases. This is done in the same way as for Lorentzian theories, by first constructing a parent action that reduces to a pair of dual actions. In the case of Maxwell theory, each pair of dual actions consists of the known `electric' and `magnetic' limits of the original theories, showing that these limits are related by an off-shell electromagnetic duality. We have obtained dualities between on one hand the non-Lorentzian contractions of linearised gravity in second-order form, and on the other hand the theories one obtains by gauging the corresponding kinematic algebras. In the Carrollian contraction, these dual actions reproduce the known `electric' and `magnetic' Carrollian theories of gravity, and we find a similar result in the Galilean case.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that in the large central charge $c$ limit, the Virasoro blocks in CFT$_2$ suffer from information loss when studying the BTZ black holes in the dual AdS$_3$ theory. Recent studies have proved that non-perturbative $e^{-c}$ corrections resolves information loss. Here, we study universal features of the spectrum of heavy states from general properties of finite $c$ Virasoro conformal blocks. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of correlators beyond "Page" time $ t \sim S_{BH}$, entropy of the black hole. In the Lorentzian regime, we wish to better understand the transition from an exponential decay behaviour of Virasoro blocks in the heavy-light limit to a power-law decay at late times.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Vector Duality and Mirror Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Mirror symmetry was first observed in worldsheet string constructions and shown to have profound implications in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications, and for the properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It opened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal compactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the antisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal moduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli, whereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In the past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality in the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This was achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited spinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence generating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the spinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can be used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles. Spinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program, by exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete worldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit. The SVD suggests a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding versus those that do not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:hep-th/0206078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   We consider in detail an approach (proposed by the author earlier) where quantum states are described by elements of a linear space over a Galois field, and operators of physical quantities - by linear operators in this space. The notion of Galois fields (which is extremely simple and elegant) is discussed in detail and we also discuss the conditions when our description gives the same predictions as the conventional one. In quantum theory based on a Galois field, all operators are well defined and divergencies cannot not exist in principle. A particle and its antiparticle are described by the same modular irreducible representation of the symmetry algebra. This automatically explains the existence of antiparticles and shows that a particle and its antiparticle are the different states of the same object. As a consequence, a new symmetry arises, and the structure of the theory is considerably simplified. In particular, one can work with only creation operators or only annihilation ones since they are no more independent. In our approach the problem arises whether the existence of neutral elementary particles (e.g. the photon) is compatible with the usual relation between spin and statistics, or in other words whether neutral particles can be elementary or only composite.</description>

Abstract:   As argued in our previous papers, it would be more natural to modify the standard approach to quantum theory by requiring that i) one unitary irreducible representation (UIR) of the symmetry algebra should describe a particle and its antiparticle simultaneously. This would automatically explain the existence of antiparticles and show that a particle and its antiparticle are different states of the same object. If i) is adopted then among the Poincare, so(2,3) and so(1,4) algebras only the latter is a candidate for constructing elementary particle theory. We extend our analysis in hep-th/0210144 and prove that: 1) UIRs of the so(1,4) algebra can indeed be interpreted in the framework of i) and cannot be interpreted in the framework of the standard approach; 2) as a consequence of a new symmetry (called AB one) between particles and antiparticles for UIRs satisfying i), elementary particles described by UIRs of the so(1,4) algebra can be only fermions; 3) as a consequence of the AB symmetry, the vacuum condition can be consistent only for particles with the half-integer spin (in conventional units) and therefore only such particles can be elementary. In our approach the well known fact that fermions have imaginary parity is a consequence of the AB symmetry.</description>

      <title>Intermediate statistics: addressing the thermoelectric properties of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of a crystalline solid by applying intermediate statistics obtained by deforming known solid state models using the mathematics of $q$-analogs. We apply the resulting $q$-deformation to both the Einstein and Debye models and study the deformed thermal and electrical conductivities and the deformed Debye specific heat. We find that the $q$-deformation acts in two different ways -- but not necessarily as independent mechanisms. First, it acts as an effective factor of disorder or impurity, modifying the characteristics of a crystalline structure, which are phenomena described by q-bosons. Second, it also manifests intermediate statistics, namely, the B-anyons (or B-type systems). For the latter case, we have identified the Schottky effect, normally associated with high-$T_c$ superconductors in the presence of rare-earth-ion impurities. We also find that it increases the specific heat of the solids beyond the Dulong-Petit limit at high temperature. Such an effect is usually related to anharmonicity of interatomic interactions. Alternatively, since in the $q$-bosons case the statistics are in principle maintained, the effect of the deformation acts more slowly due to a small change in the crystal lattice. On the other hand, B-anyons that belong to modified statistics are more sensitive to the deformation. The results reported here may be verified experimentally, for instance, in experimental samples by inserting impurities, or changes in pressure or temperature if one assumes these tuning quantities are related with the q-deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Repeated measurements on non-replicable systems and their consequences for Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial vector torsion-spin coupling effects in the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity with the general Yang-Mills type Lagrangian. The dynamical equations for the ``electric'' and ``magnetic'' components of the torsion field variable are obtained in the general form and it is shown that the helicity density and the spin density of the electromagnetic field appear as the physical sources. The modified Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field are derived, and the electromagnetic wave propagation under the action of the uniform homogeneous torsion field is considered. We demonstrate the Faraday effect of rotation of the polarization for such a wave, and establish the strong bound on the possible cosmic axial torsion field from the astrophysical data.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetry and maximal symmetry-topological-order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A characteristic property of a gapless liquid state is its emergent symmetry and dual symmetry, associated with the conservation laws of symmetry charges and symmetry defects respectively. These conservation laws, considered on an equal footing, can't be described simply by the representation theory of a group (or a higher group). They are best described in terms of a topological order (TO) with gappable boundary in one higher dimension; we call this the symTO of the gapless state. The symTO can thus be considered a fingerprint of the gapless state. We propose that a largely complete characterization of a gapless state, up to local-low-energy equivalence, can be obtained in terms of its maximal emergent symTO. In this paper, we review the symmetry/topological-order (Symm/TO) correspondence and propose a precise definition of maximal symTO. We discuss various examples to illustrate these ideas. We find that the 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal symTO described by the 2+1D double-Ising topological order. We provide a derivation of this result using symmetry twists in an exactly solvable model of the Ising critical point. The critical point in the 3-state Potts model has a maximal symTO of double (6,5)-minimal-model topological order. As an example of a noninvertible symmetry in 1+1D, we study the possible gapless states of a Fibonacci anyon chain with emergent double-Fibonacci symTO. We find the Fibonacci-anyon chain without translation symmetry has a critical point with unbroken double-Fibonacci symTO. In fact, such a critical theory has a maximal symTO of double (5,4)-minimal-model topological order. We argue that, in the presence of translation symmetry, the above critical point becomes a stable gapless phase with no symmetric relevant operator.</description>

      <title>Bethe vectors and recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Olshanski twisted Yangian based models, known as one-dimensional "soliton non-preserving" open spin chains, by means of algebraic Bethe ansatz. The even case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ or $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n}$, was studied in arXiv:1710.08409. In the present work, we focus on the odd case, when the bulk symmetry is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2n+1}$ and the boundary symmetry is $\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}$. We explicitly construct Bethe vectors and present a more symmetric form of the trace formula. We use the composite model approach and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$-type recurrence relations to obtain recurrence relations for twisted Yangian based Bethe vectors, for both even and odd cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove a formula for the ${\mathbb S}_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of the moduli space of graphs $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$. Moreover, we prove that the rational ${\mathbb S}_n$-invariant cohomology of $\mathcal{MG}_{g,n}$ stabilizes for large $n$. That means, if $n \geq g \geq 2$, then there are isomorphisms $H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_n} \rightarrow H^k(\mathcal{MG}_{g,n+1};\mathbb{Q})^{{\mathbb S}_{n+1}}$ for all $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a field-theoretical model that describes the interaction between kinks and antikinks and between kinks and other heterogeneous fields and impurities. We show that the long-range kink can tunnel through a barrier created by heterogeneous fields and impurities even when the energy of the center of mass of the kink is less than the height of the energy barrier. We also study the conditions under which the kink can pass freely through a disordered medium. We introduce the concept of "effective translational symmetry". We compare our results with those from recent papers published in this journal, where the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield property is discussed.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian quantum wells in graphene: the role of shape invariance in zero-energy states trapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining Dirac fermions in graphene by electrostatic fields is a challenging task. Electric quantum dots created by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip can trap zero-energy quasi-particles. The Lorentzian quantum well provides a faithful, exactly solvable, approximation to such a potential, hosting zero-energy bound states for certain values of the coupling constant. We show that in this critical configuration, the system can be related to the free particle model by means of a supersymmetric transformation. The revealed shape invariance of the model greatly simplifies the calculation of the zero modes and naturally explains the degeneracy of the zero energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers require knowledge not only of the equilibrium properties of strongly interacting matter, but also of the system's response to perturbations, encoded in various transport coefficients. Using perturbative and holographic tools, we derive here an improved weak-coupling and a new strong-coupling result for the most important transport coefficient of unpaired quark matter, its bulk viscosity. These results are combined in a simple analytic pocket formula for the quantity that is rooted in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics at high densities but takes into account nonperturbative holographic input at neutron-star densities, where the system is strongly coupled. This expression can be used in the modeling of unpaired quark matter at astrophysically relevant temperatures and densities.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections. The model is based on quantum corrections inspired by loop quantum gravity. It is covariant and results in a spacetime that is regular everywhere with a parameter-dependent black bounce. Perturbations of these black holes due to massless scalar and electromagnetic fields have been previously calculated and some intriguing results were observed. For some modes, the frequency versus minimum-radius parameter trajectories were found to spiral and self-intersect in the complex plane. In addition, the spectrum of overtones has real frequencies that oscillate with increasing overtone number, and may even vanish for some overtones. We have calculated the quasinormal modes for all massless spin perturbations, including spin-1/2, and axial- and polar-gravitational. We find that the trajectory-spirals are restricted to scalar perturbations and observe some interesting overtone behaviour for gravitational perturbations. The amount of isospectrality violation in the gravitational quasinormal mode spectra is also examined.</description>

      <title>Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy condition violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. We find that the signal generated during the fragmentation process gives a larger contribution than the one induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in given frequency ranges for all values of $k$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse, primordial black hole, and gravitational wave in Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory with two scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational collapse to form the black hole in the acceleratingly expanding universe in the frame of Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet theory having two scalar fields and we study the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW). This may describe the creation of the primordial black holes in the early stages of the universe and the impact of their creation on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves. The collapsing spacetime can be obtained by using the formulation of the ``reconstruction'', that is, we find a model that realises the desired or given geometry. In the reconstructed models, ghosts often appear, which could be eliminated by imposing constraints. We show that the standard cosmological solutions or self-gravitating objects such as a planet, the Sun, various types of stars, etc., in Einstein's gravity, are also solutions in this model. Using the dynamical value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, the propagation of the high-frequency GW is investigated. The propagating speed changes due to the coupling during the period of the black hole formation. The speed of the GW propagation going into the black hole is different from that of the wave going out.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>A natural model for curved inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models with a non-zero background curvature require additional hypothesis or parameters compared to flat inflation and the procedure to construct them cannot be as simple as in the flat case. For this reason, there is no consensus on the primordial power spectrum that should be considered at large scales in a curved Universe. In this letter, we propose a model of curved inflation in which the usual canonical quantization and Bunch-Davies vacuum choice of the flat case can be considered. The framework is a recently proposed modification of general relativity in which a non-dynamical topological term is added to the Einstein equation. The model is universal as it is the same for any background curvature, and no additional parameters or hypothesis on the initial spatial curvature are introduced. This gives a natural and simple solution to the problem of constructing curved inflation, and at the same time provides an additional argument for this topological modification of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Capped Vertex Functions for $\text{Hilb}^n (\mathbb{C}^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

      <title>Cold Darkogenesis: Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry in Light of the PTA Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build upon the intriguing possibility that the recently reported nano-Hz gravitational wave signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments is sourced by a strong first-order phase transition from a nearly conformal dark sector. The phase transition has to be strongly supercooled to explain the signal amplitude, while the critical temperature has to be in the $\cal{O}$(GeV) range, as dictated by the peak frequency of the gravitational wave spectrum. However, the resulting strong supercooling exponentially dilutes away any pre-existing baryon asymmetry and dark matter, calling for a new paradigm of their productions. We then develop a mechanism of cold darkogenesis that generates a dark asymmetry during the phase transition from the textured dark $SU(2)_{\rm D}$ Higgs field. This dark asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via neutron portal interactions, resulting in the observed baryon asymmetry. Furthermore, the mechanism naturally leads to the correct abundance of asymmetric dark matter, with self-interaction of the scale that is of the right order to solve the diversity problem in galactic rotation curves. Collider searches for mono-jets and dark matter direct detection experiments can dictate the viability of the model.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of analog gravity systems II: Rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of analog gravity systems which admit rotation and energy-dependent boundary conditions. By extending two recent results, we provide a recipe that allows one to relate resonant transmission spectra with effective potentials and even reconstruct the boundary condition at the core. Our methodology is based on the WKB method and the identification of universal features in the transmission. One of the main advantages of this method is that it is parameter-free, and relies only on general properties of the underlying potential, instead of specific models. While the reconstruction of underlying potentials is generally not uniquely possible, the inverse method provides effective potentials with similar spectral properties to the original one. To demonstrate the accuracy and scope of our method, we apply it to a rotating imperfect draining vortex, which has been proposed as an analog system to astrophysical extreme compact objects. We conclude that the capability to explore energy-dependent boundary conditions could be of interest for experimental studies of such systems.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description of hadronic matter from a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microscopic nuclear matter formalism with explicit chiral symmetry based on the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model is considered to describe nuclear matter. To reproduce nuclear matter properties adequately at the saturation density, four-point and eight-point interactions are introduced. Within a Bayesian inference approach, the parameters of the model are determined by imposing nuclear matter, both experimental and from {\it ab-initio} calculations, and neutron star observational constraints. Nuclear matter properties are well reproduced with an effective mass of 0.75 to 0.8 nucleon mass at the saturation density. At 90% confidence level, the radius of a $1.4 ~\rm M_\odot$ star varies between 11.48 km and 13.20 km, masses as large as $\sim 2.2 ~\rm M_\odot$ are predicted and the radius of a 2 M$_\odot$ star is above 10.5 km. High-density perturbative QCD (pQCD) results exclude equations of state that predict larger maximum masses and radii. The speed of sound increases monotonically with density and reaches values as large as $\sqrt{0.7}c$-$\sqrt{0.8}c$ in the center of massive stars. Several properties such as the polytropic index or the renormalized trace anomaly, that have been proposed to identify the deconfined phase transition, are analyzed. Interestingly, the radius of the obtained posterior that also meets pQCD constraints aligns closely with the mass-radius measurement of the recent PSR J0437-4715, which contrasts with other relativistic mean field model results.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, two types of static black hole models that retain general covariance have been proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG). We have studied the light rings and shadows of these black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing method, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of static black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of light rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the photon trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do not affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce the size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller. However, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish it from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the quantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in EQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the ring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in EQG or general relativity (GR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, Chow groups, and Grothendieck groups of coherent sheaves), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After very little memories we review slightly Paul Frampton's memories from the discovery of Veneziano model being indeed string theory with Y. Nambu and secondly his 3-3-1 theory.This latter is an indeed not excluded replacement for the Standard Model with triangle anomalies cancelling as they must in a truly viable theory. It even needs (essentially) 3 as the family number! Also primordial black holes as dark matter is mentioned, we end with review of a my own very speculative utterly recent idea, that for the purpose of the classical approximation, we could, using the functional integral as our rudimentary assumption taken over from quantum mechanics, obtain the equations of motion without the in our opinion very mysterious imaginary unit i, which usually occurs as a factor in the exponent of the functional integrand, which is this i times the action. The functional integral without the mysterious i leads to predicting some of the most strong features in cosmology, and also seems to argue for as little black holes as possible.</description>

      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>
