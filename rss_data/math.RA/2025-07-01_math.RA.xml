      <title>Comultiplicative map on projective resolution for a family of algebras one of which is cluster-tilted type D4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a comultiplicative map on the projective bimodule resolution for a family of algebras one of which is cluster-tilted of type D4. The comultiplicative map is presented in terms of idempotents associated with vertices of the quiver and a chain homotopy map is used to describe the multiplicative structure on the Hochschild cohomology ring of the first member of the family. We define a star product used to describe the cup product structure on the Hochschild cohomology ring for all family members.</description>

      <title>Group gradings on classical Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify, up to isomorphism, the group gradings on the non-exceptional classical simple Lie superalgebras, except for type A(1,1), over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. To this end, we study graded-simple and graded-superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras satisfying the descending chain condition on graded left superideals, which allows us to classify abelian group gradings on finite-dimensional simple and superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2.</description>

      <title>Totally acyclic complexes and homological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivalent characterizations of the condition that every acyclic complex of projective (resp., injective and flat) modules is totally acyclic over a general ring R. This line of inquiry was initiated by Iyengar and Krause in 2006 for commutative Noetherian rings with dualizing complexes. We demonstrate that certain equivalent conditions are closely related to the invariants silp(R) and spli(R) defined by Gedrich and Gruenberg, as well as to the invariant sfli(R) defined by Ding and Chen. We also examine some sufficient conditions for the equality spli(R) = silp(R), that leads to a generalization of a result by Ballas and Chatzistavridis that was originally proved in the case that R is a left (and right) coherent ring which is isomorphic with its opposite ring. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate relations among these conditions.</description>

      <title>Affinization of algebraic structures: Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general procedure of affinization of linear algebra structures is illustrated by the case of Leibniz algebras. Specifically, the definition of an affine Leibniz bracket, that is, a bi-affine operation on an affine space that at each tangent vector space becomes a (bi-linear) Leibniz bracket in terms of a tri-affine operation called a Leibnizian, is given. An affine space together with such an operation is called a Leibniz affgebra. It is shown that any Leibniz algebra can be extended to a family of Leibniz affgebras. Depending on the choice of a Leibnizian different types of Leibniz affgebras are introduced. These include: derivative-type, which captures the derivation property of linear Leibniz bracket; homogeneous-type, which is based on the simplest and least restrictive choice of the Leibnizian; Lie-type which includes all Lie affgebras introduced in [R.R. Andruszkiewicz, T. Brzezi\'nski &amp; K. Radziszewski, Lie affgebras vis-\`a-vis Lie algebras, Res. Math. 80 (2025), art. 61.]. Each type is illustrated by examples with prescribed Leibniz algebra fibres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the central extension method for solvable Leibniz algebras. Using this method, a complete classification of one-dimensional abelian extensions of five-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebras with a non-trivial three-dimensional nilradical is obtained. Furthermore, we explore extensions of solvable Leibniz algebras whose nilradical is null-filiform, establishing that, in this case, there exists a unique solvable abelian extension.</description>

      <title>A New Definition of Superbiderivations for Lie Superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study superbiderivations on Lie superalgebras from structural and geometric perspectives. Motivated by the classical fact that the bracket of a Lie algebra is itself a biderivation, we propose a new definition of superbiderivation for Lie superalgebras, one that requires the bracket to be a superbiderivation, a condition not satisfied by existing definitions in the literature. Our focus is on complete Lie superalgebras, a natural generalization of semisimple Lie algebras that has emerged as a promising framework in the search for alternative structural notions. In this setting, we introduce and study linear supercommuting maps, comparing our definition with previous proposals. Finally, we present two applications: one involving the superalgebra of superderivations of the Heisenberg Lie superalgebra and another offering initial geometric insights into deformation theory via superbiderivations.</description>

      <title>Semisimplifying Lie algebras of $J$-ternary algebras in characteristic $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a class of Lie superalgebras in characteristic $3$, containing the Elduque-Cunha superalgebras $\mathfrak{g}(3,3), \mathfrak{g}(6,6)$ and the Elduque superalgebra $\mathfrak{el}(5,3)$, using the tensor product of composition algebras. For the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{el}(5,3)$, this allows us to move beyond the contragredient construction and it also allows us to construct more general forms.
  We also describe how one obtains these Lie superalgebras using the semisimplification functor on the representation category $\mathbf{Rep}(\alpha_3)$ to Lie algebras of type $E_6, E_7$ and $E_8$, in line with how Arun Kannan applied this functor to the split algebras. We further apply this functor more broadly to the class of Lie algebras coming from $J$-ternary algebras over fields of characteristic $3$.</description>

      <title>BV structure on the Hochschild cohomology of twisted tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two Frobenius algebras, we describe the BV operator on the Hochschild cohomology of their tensor product twisted by a bicharacter in terms of twisted BV operators on summands of the Hochschild cohomology described by Briggs and Witherspoon. This specialises to the case of non-twisted tensor products, and in doing so generalises a result of Le and Zhou. This allows us to simplify calculations in the literature significantly.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and derivations of a universal left-symmetric enveloping algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n$-dimensional algebra with zero multiplication over a field $K$ of characteristic $0$. Then its universal (multiplicative) enveloping algebra $U_n$ in the variety of left-symmetric algebras is a homogeneous quadratic algebra generated by $2n$ elements $l_1,\ldots,l_n,r_1,\ldots,r_n$, which contains both the polynomial algebra $L_n=K[l_1,\ldots,l_n]$ and the free associative algebra $R_n=K\langle r_1,\ldots,r_n\rangle$. We show that the automorphism groups of the polynomial algebra $L_n$ and the algebra $U_n$ are isomorphic for all $n\geq 2$, based on a detailed analysis of locally nilpotent derivations. In contrast, we show that this isomorphism does not hold for $n=1$, and we provide a complete description of all automorphisms and locally nilpotent derivations of $U_1$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of GCD tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S=\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n}\}$ be an ordered set of $n$ distinct positive integers. The $m$th-order $n$-dimensional tensor ${T}_{[S]}=(t_{i_{1}i_{2}\ldots i_{m}}),$ where $t_{i_{1}i_{2}\ldots i_{m}}=GCD(s_{i_{1}},s_{i_{2}},\ldots,s_{i_{m}}),$ the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $s_{i_{1}},s_{i_{2}},\ldots,$ and $s_{i_{m}}$ is called the GCD tensor on $S$. The earliest result on GCD tensors goes back to Smith [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc., 1976], who computed the determinant of GCD matrix on $S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ using the Euler's totient function, followed by Beslin-Ligh [Linear Algebra Appl., 1989] who showed all GCD matrices are positive definite. In this note, we study the positivity of higher-order tensors in the $k$-mode product. We show that all GCD tensors are strongly completely positive (CP). We then show that GCD tensors are infinite divisible. In fact, we prove that for every nonnegative real number $r,$ the tensor ${T}_{[S]}^{\circ r}=(t^{r}_{i_{1}i_{2}\ldots i_{m}})$ is strongly CP. Finally, we obtain an interesting decomposition of GCD tensors using Euler's totient function $\Phi$. Using this decomposition, we show that the determinant of the $m$th-order GCD tensor ${T}_{[S]}$ on a factor-closed set $S=\{s_1,\dots,s_n\}$ is $\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} \Phi(s_{i})^{(m-1)^{(n-1)}}$.</description>

Abstract: This article is a survey of Ecalle's theory of flexion units. In particular, we provide complete proofs of several key assertions that were stated without proof in Ecalle's original works. These results are crucial for understanding applications of flexion units to the theory of multiple zeta values and the Kashiwara-Vergne problem.</description>

      <title>Rises for Measuring Local Distributivity in Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributivity is a well-established and extensively studied notion in lattice theory. In the context of data analysis, particularly within Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), lattices are often observed to exhibit a high degree of distributivity. However, no standardized measure exists to quantify this property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of rises in (concept) lattices as a means to assess distributivity. Rises capture how the number of attributes or objects in covering concepts change within the concept lattice. We show that a lattice is distributive if and only if no non-unit rises occur. Furthermore, we relate rises to the classical notion of meet- and join distributivity. We observe that concept lattices from real-world data are to a high degree join-distributive, but much less meet-distributive. We additionally study how join-distributivity manifests on the level of ordered sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Drinfel'd proposed the study of set-theoretical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, initiating a line of research that has since garnered substantial attention and led to notable developments in algebra, low-dimensional topology, and related areas. This monograph offers a concise introduction to the algebraic theory of such solutions, focusing on key structures including skew braces, quandles, racks, and Rota-Baxter groups, which have emerged as central objects in this framework. We investigate the algebraic, combinatorial, and homological properties of these structures, with an emphasis on their interrelations and applications to knot theory. The monograph is intended as a reference for researchers interested in the deep interplay between these algebraic structures and the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the monomial arrow removal operation for bound quiver algebras, and show that it is a novel reduction technique for determining the finiteness of the finitistic dimension. Our approach first develops a general method within the theory of abelian category cleft extensions. We then demonstrate that the specific conditions of this method are satisfied by the cleft extensions arising from strict monomial arrow removals. This crucial connection is established through the application of non-commutative Gr\"{o}bner bases in the sense of Green. The theory is illustrated with various concrete examples.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"obner basis for powers of a general linear form in a monomial complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study almost complete intersection ideals in a polynomial ring, generated by powers of all the variables together with a power of their sum. Our main result is an explicit description of the reduced Gr\"obner bases for these ideals under any term order. Our approach is primarily combinatorial, focusing on the structure of the initial ideal. We associate a lattice path to each monomial in the vector space basis of an Artinian monomial complete intersection and introduce a reflection operation on these paths, which enables a key counting argument. As a consequence, we provide a new proof that Artinian monomial complete intersections possess the strong Lefschetz property over fields of characteristic zero. Our results also offer new insights into the longstanding problem of classifying the weak Lefschetz property for such intersections in characteristic $p$. Furthermore, we show that the number of Gr\"obner basis elements in each degree is connected to several well-known sequences, including the (generalized) Catalan, Motzkin, and Riordan numbers, and connect these numbers to the study of entanglement detection in spin systems within quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an order, a commutative ring whose additive group is free of finite rank, a natural computational question is whether a fixed univariate polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ has a root in this ring. In this paper, we show that the computational difficulty of this depends strongly on the arithmetic properties of $f$. We show that with probability 1, determining whether $f$ has a root is NP-complete. For $\text{deg } f \leq 3$ we give a full classification of the computational complexity: some special $f$ admit a polynomial-time algorithm, and for all other $f$ the problem is NP-complete. Additionally, we prove the problem is undecidable for $f = (X^2+1)^2$, conditional on Hilberts Tenth Problem for $\mathbb{Q}(i)$. The key ingredients for proving NP-completeness are a new source of NP-complete group-theoretic problems developed in previous work, and a full classification of cubic polynomials with discriminant divisible only by $3$.</description>

      <title>Linear algebra over T-pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05257v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is part of an ongoing project to find a general algebraic framework for semiring theory. The structure theory of semirings is quite challenging, largely because of the lack of negation, and such basic properties such as unique factorization of polynomials, multiplicativity of determinants, and the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, all fail. (In fact in the max-plus algebra, the sum of two nonzero elements is never zero!) Consequently 0 is replaced by a distinguished T-submodule $ A_0$ of $ A,$ and $( A, A_0)$ is called a ``pair.'' This paper treats linear algebra over a (not necessarily distributive) semiring pair, with a range of applications to tropical algebra as well as related areas such as hyperrings and fuzzy rings.
  We turn to matrices and the question of whether the row rank, column rank, and submatrix rank of a matrix are equal. The submatrix rank is less than or equal to the row rank and the column rank in many cases, including ``metatangible pairs'' with unique negation, but there is a counterexample to equality, discovered some time ago by the second author, which we provide in a more general setting (``pairs of the second kind'') that includes the hyperfield of signs. We do find situations when equality holds, encompassing results by Akian, Gaubert, Guterman, Izhakian, Knebusch, and Rowen, including versions of Cramer's rule. We pay special attention to the question of Baker and Zhang whether $n+1$ vectors of length $n$ need be dependent.
  At the conclusion of the main part, we consider surpassing relations, which permit us to tighten our results. The categorical setting is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>The Graded Algebras with a Graded Identity of Degree 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of graded associative algebras that satisfy a graded polynomial identity of degree $2$. %
Let $\mathsf{G}$ be a finite abelian group, $\mathbb{F}$ a field of characteristic zero and $\mathfrak{A}$ a $\mathsf{G}$-graded $\mathbb{F}$-algebra. %
We prove that, for $\mathbb{F}$ algebraically closed, if $\mathfrak{A}_e$ satisfies a polynomial identity $g=g(x_1^{(e)}, \dots, x_n^{(e)})\in\mathbb{F}\langle X^\mathsf{G} \rangle$ of degree $2$, then $\mathfrak{A}$ is either nilpotent or has commutative neutral component, %
and we ensure that the $\mathsf{G}$-graded variety $\mathfrak{W}^\mathsf{G}$ determined by $g$ is equal to either $\mathsf{var}^\mathsf{G}([x^{(e)},y^{(e)}])$ or $\mathsf{var}^\mathsf{G}(N)$ for some nilpotent $\mathsf{G}$-graded algebra $N$. %
Posteriorly, we investigate the implications of $\mathfrak{A}_e$ being central in $\mathfrak{A}$. The results obtained allow us to prove that, when $\mathsf{G}$ is finite cyclic, if $\mathfrak{A}$ is finitely generated and $\mathfrak{A}_e$ is central in $\mathfrak{A}$, then the commutator ideal of $\mathfrak{A}$ is nilpotent, and the algebra $\mathfrak{A}^{(-)}=(\mathfrak{A},[\ ,\ ])$ is a solvable Lie algebra, %
and, if $\mathsf{G}$ has odd order, then $[x_1,x_2][x_3,x_4]\cdots[x_{2d-1},x_{2d}]\equiv0$ in $\mathfrak{A}$, for some $d\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>The Graded Dual of a Combinatorial Hopf Algebra on Partition Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: John M. Campbell constructed a combinatorial Hopf algebra (CHA) \text{ParSym} on partition diagrams by lifting the CHA structure of \text{NSym} (the Hopf algebra of noncommutative symmetric functions) through an analogous approach. In this article, we define \text{ParQSym}, which is the graded dual of \text{ParSym}. Its CHA structure is defined in an explicit, combinatorial way, by analogy with that of the CHA \text{QSym} of quasisymmetric functions. And we give some subcoalgebra and Hopf subalgebras of \text{ParQSym}, some gradings and filtrations of \text{ParSym} and \text{ParQSym}, and some bases of \text{ParSym} and \text{ParQSym} by analogy with some distinguished bases of \text{NSym} and \text{QSym}.</description>

      <title>The Dixmier problem for skew PBW extensions and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss for skew $PBW$ extensions the famous Dixmier problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier in 1968. The skew $PBW$ extensions are noncommutative rings of polynomial type and covers several algebras and rings arising in mathematical physics and noncommutative algebraic geometry. For this purpose, we introduce the Dixmier algebras and we will study the Dixmier problem for algebras over commutative rings, in particular, for $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, i.e., for arbitrary rings. The results are focused on the investigation of the Dixmier problem for matrix algebras, product of algebras, tensor product of algebras and also on the Dixmier question for the following particular key skew $PBW$ extension: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ be the $K$-algebra generated by $n\geq 2$ elements $x_1,\dots,x_n$ subject to relations
  $$x_jx_i=x_ix_j+d_{ij}, \ for \ all \ 1\leq i&lt;j\leq n, \ with \ d_{ij}\in K-\{0\}$$.
  We prove that the algebra $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is central and simple. In the last section we present a matrix-computational approach to the problem formulated by Jacques Dixmier and also we compute some concrete nontrivial examples of automorphisms of the first Weyl algebra $A_1(K)$ and $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ using the MAPLE library SPBWE developed for the first author.We compute the inverses of these automorphisms, and for $A_1(K)$, its factorization through some elementary automorphisms. For $n$ odd, we found some endomorphisms of $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ that are not automorphisms. We conjecture that $\mathcal{CSD}_n(K)$ is Dixmier when $n$ is even.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By previous work of Ced\'{o}, Smoktunowicz, and Vendramin, one already knows that the analog of Gr\"{u}n's lemma fails to hold for perfect skew left braces when the socle is used as an analog of the center of a group. In this paper, we use the annihilator instead of the socle. We shall show that the analog of Gr\"{u}n's lemma holds for perfect two-sided skew braces but not in general.</description>

      <title>A multiplication formula for cluster characters in gentle algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multiplication formula for cluster characters induced by generating extensions in a gentle algebra A, generalizing a result of Cerulli Irelli, Esposito, Franzen, Reineke. In the case where A is the gentle algebra of a triangulation T of an unpunctured marked surface, this provides a representation-theoretic interpretation of the exchange relations in the cluster algebra with principal coefficients in T. As an application, we interpret a formula that relates cluster variables of type B to cluster variables of type A in the symmetric module category of the algebras arising from special triangulations of a regular polygon.</description>

      <title>Torsion modules and differential operators in infinitely many variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper grew out of the author's work on arXiv:2504.18460. Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field. We also discuss extension of differential operators to localizations of rings and modules, and to colocalizations of modules.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a bimodule with a factorization structure (BFS) and show that such a structure gives rise to an algebra morphism. We then prove that this framework offers an interpretation of the geometric construction underlying both the Betti and de Rham harmonic coproducts of the double shuffle theory developed Enriquez-Furusho inspired by an unpublished preprint of Deligne-Terasoma.</description>
