      <title>Four binary microlenses with directly measured masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys, aiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on two key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings for measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}$), and long durations enabling microlens-parallax ($\pi_{\rm E}$) measurements. Four events met these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining the normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes with the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude. Additionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve modeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of Earth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and distance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and KMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than that of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type of lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby, with distances $\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the Galactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component has a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has about half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater distance, roughly 4.5 kpc.</description>

      <title>Developments on LLNL's high contrast testbed and Lick/ShaneAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLNL has recently setup a High Contrast Testbed (HCT) for AO and exoplanet imaging technology development. We present the various HCT technologies currently under development, including (1) a Wynne corrector, (2) multi-wavefront sensor (WFS) single conjugate AO (SCAO) control. We present HCT testing results of a first Wynne corrector prototype with a self-coherent camera. We present updates on development efforts to design and apply multi-WFS SCAO control to our HCT setup. We also present ongoing HCT deformable mirror and WFS upgrades. Lastly, we present developments for REDWOODS, a project to deploy many of these technologies on-sky on a sub-bench of the Shane AO system at Lick Observatory.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the velocity response of a table-top EPR Speedmeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.</description>

      <title>First Results from WINERED: Detection of Emission Lines from Neutral Iron and a Combined Set of Trace Species on the Dayside of WASP-189 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground and space-based observations have revealed that Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJs,~$T_{\rm{eq}} &gt; 2200 \ \rm{K}$) typically have inverted thermal profiles, while cooler hot Jupiters have non-inverted ones. This shift is theorized due to the onset of strong optical absorbers like metal oxides (e.g., TiO, VO), metal hydrides (e.g. FeH), atomic species (e.g., Fe, Ti), and ions (e.g., H$^-$). High-resolution spectroscopy is valuable for characterizing the thermal, chemical, and dynamical atmospheric structures due to its sensitivity to detailed spectral line shapes. The newly commissioned WINERED high-resolution spectrograph ($R\sim68,000$) on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope enhances capabilities with its high throughput in the J-band (1.13-1.35 $\mu$m), capturing strong spectral features from key atmospheric species. In this study, we report detecting the dayside atmosphere of the UHJ WASP-189 b at a $S/N\sim10$, marking the first exoplanet atmosphere detection in emission with WINERED. Individually, we identify strong neutral iron (Fe) emission lines at a $S/N=6.3$, and tentatively detect neutral magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) at a $S/N&gt;4$. Although not individually detected, we detect a combined set of trace species at a $S/N=7.2$, which is attributed mostly to neutral chromium (Cr) and aluminum (Al), alongside magnesium and silicon. These results help refine the understanding of key atmospheric species that influence the thermal structure of WASP-189 b and UHJs more broadly.</description>

      <title>Inference with finite time series II: the window strikes back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth window functions are often applied to strain data when inferring the parameters describing the astrophysical sources of gravitational-wave transients. Within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, it is conventional to include a term to account for power loss due to this window in the likelihood function. We show that the inclusion of this factor leads to biased inference. The simplest solution to this, omitting the factor, leads to unbiased posteriors and Bayes factor estimates provided the window does not suppress the signal for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(100)$, but unreliable estimates of the absolute likelihood. Instead, we propose a multi-stage method that yields consistent estimates for the absolute likelihood in addition to unbiased posterior distributions and Bayes factors for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(1000)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the commonly held wisdom that using rectangular windows necessarily leads to biased inference is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Detailed Analyses for DC readout and a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum expectation value and the stationary noise spectral density for a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector with a DC readout scheme are discussed in detail only through the quantum electrodynamics of lasers and the Heisenberg equations of mirrors' motion. We demonstrate that the initial conditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency of the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest. Although in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the laser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density decreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral density shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser power is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation pressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the classical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme. Since the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a classical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium point of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must consider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in equilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is incomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this incompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror displacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover the near ideal case.</description>

      <title>The DeepFMKit Python package: A toolbox for simulating and analyzing deep frequency modulation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.</description>

      <title>Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA): Advancing the U.S. Priorities in Gravitational-wave and Lunar Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) is a next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) facility on the Moon. By harnessing the Moon's unique environment, LILA fills a critical observational gap in the mid-band GW spectrum ($0.1 - 10$ Hz) between terrestrial detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA) and the future space mission LISA. Observations enabled by LILA will fundamentally transform multi-messenger astrophysics and GW probes of fundamental physics. LILA will measure the lunar deep interior better than any existing planetary seismic instruments. The LILA mission is designed for phased development aligned with capabilities of the U.S.'s Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs. LILA is a unique collaboration between universities, space industries, U.S. government laboratories, and international partners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology and artificial intelligence in Africa.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in active galactic nuclei as a precursor of multi-messenger gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>
