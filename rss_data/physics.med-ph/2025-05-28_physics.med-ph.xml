      <title>Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models for therapeutic approaches involving electric conductors or shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up a mathematical model for a DC current in a human tissue that shows an attenuation effect in an extended circuit. We give a positive lower bound on the time duration over which this is guaranteed to happen in terms of the parameters of the model. We also discuss shielding and coupling in the context of electrical aspects of biological processes.</description>

      <title>Decoding Breast Cancer in X-ray Mammograms: A Multi-Parameter Approach Using Fractals, Multifractals, and Structural Disorder Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the fractal and multifractal characteristics of breast mammogram micrographs to identify quantitative biomarkers associated with breast cancer progression. In addition to conventional fractal and multifractal analyses, we employed a recently developed fractal-functional distribution method, which transforms fractal measures into Gaussian distributions for more robust statistical interpretation. Given the sparsity of mammogram intensity data, we also analyzed how variations in intensity thresholds, used for binary transformations of the fractal dimension, follow unique trajectories that may serve as novel indicators of disease progression. Our findings demonstrate that fractal, multifractal, and fractal-functional parameters effectively differentiate between benign and cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the threshold-dependent behavior of intensity-based fractal measures presents distinct patterns in cancer cases. To complement these analyses, we applied the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) light localization technique to quantify structural disorder at the microscopic level. This multi-parametric approach, integrating spatial complexity and structural disorder metrics, offers a promising framework for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the production of radionuclides in a PMMA (Polymethylmethacrylate) phantom irradiated with Very High Energy Electrons (VHEE) beams as a novel method for dose verification. In this work, Monte Carlo simulation studies using the Geant4 toolkit and experimental measurements with a VHEE beam produced by a laser-plasma accelerator were conducted. Specifically, the photonuclear production of 11C, 15O and 13N is examined, with a detailed analysis of their spatial distribution, production yields and decay time</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning and Mathematical Modeling for Tumor Dynamics Prediction: Comparing SPIONs against mNP-FDG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a Machine Learning guided study towards zone-specific ray therapy. Combining Machine Learning (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with continuum modeling (exponential and logistic growth), we find that while fluorodeoxyglucose-coated (mNP-FDG) can control cancerous tumor progression within 2 days compared to 18 days by Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), for complete termination of the tumor, SPIONS (20 days) are superior compared to mNP-FDG (more than 40 days). We also provide an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter/Python that allows users to input relevant data, such as treatment type and time, to receive real-time tumor volume predictions. Our ML-guided prediction indicates joint therapy as the optimum choice, with mNP-FDG ideal for taming the tumor spread, followed by SPIONs for complete eradication, facilitating personalized cancer treatment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Identifying Heart Attack Risk in Vulnerable Population: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and 'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Computational Feasibility of Direct Pseudoinversion of the Encoding Matrix for MR Image Reconstruction (Pinv-Recon)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is fundamentally a linear inverse problem, such that the image can be recovered via explicit pseudoinversion of the encoding matrix by solving $\textbf{data} = \textbf{Encode} \times \textbf{image}$ - a method referred to here as Pinv-Recon. While the benefits of this approach were acknowledged in early studies, the field has historically favored fast Fourier transforms (FFT) and iterative techniques due to perceived computational limitations of the pseudoinversion approach. This work revisits Pinv-Recon in the context of modern hardware, software, and optimized linear algebra routines. We compare various matrix inversion strategies, assess regularization effects, and demonstrate incorporation of advanced encoding physics into a unified reconstruction framework.
  While hardware advances have already significantly reduced computation time compared to earlier studies, our work further demonstrates that leveraging Cholesky decomposition and block-wise inversion leads to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over previous Singular Value Decomposition-based implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of Pinv-Recon on diverse \textit{in vivo} datasets encompassing a range of encoding schemes, starting with low- to medium-resolution functional and metabolic imaging and extending to high-resolution cases. Our findings establish Pinv-Recon as a practical and adaptable reconstruction method that aligns with the increasing emphasis on open-source and reproducible MRI research.</description>

      <title>Positronium Imaging: History, Current Status, and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positronium imaging was recently proposed to image the properties of positronium atoms in the patient body. Positronium properties depend on the size of intramolecular voids and oxygen concentration; therefore, they deliver information different and complementary to the anatomic, morphological, and metabolic images. Thus far, the mean ortho-positronium lifetime imaging has been at the center of research interest. The first ex vivo and in vivo positronium lifetime images of humans have been demonstrated with the dedicated J-PET scanner enabling simultaneous registration of annihilation photons and prompt gamma from ${\beta^{+} \gamma}$ emitters. Annihilation photons are used to reconstruct the annihilation place and time while prompt gamma is used to reconstruct the time of positronium formation. This review describes recent achievements in the translation of positronium imaging into clinics. The first measurements of positronium lifetime in humans with commercial PET scanners modernized to register triple coincidences are reported. The in vivo observations of differences in ortho-positronium lifetime between tumor and healthy tissues and between different oxygen concentrations are discussed. So far, the positronium lifetime measurements in humans were completed with clinically available ${^{68}\text{Ga}}$, ${^{82}\text{Rb}}$, and ${^{124}\text{I}}$ radionuclides. Status and challenges in developing positronium imaging on a way to a clinically useful procedure are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>
