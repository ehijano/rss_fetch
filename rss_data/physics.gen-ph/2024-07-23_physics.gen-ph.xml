      <title>Tiling Spaces and the Expanding Universe: Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a heuristic model of the universe as a growing quasicrystal projected from a higher-dimensional lattice. By extending the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a particle in a box with time-dependent boundaries, we derive an equation that resembles the Friedmann equation, addressing the Hubble tension. This model incorporates phonons and phasons, providing insights into cosmic-scale dynamics and the universe's expansion. We outline a pre-inflation tiling space phase with quantum error correction, a radiation phase dominated by quasiparticles, and a post-radiation phase with the emergence of matter. Our hypothesis, which posits that the universe is a growing quasicrystal, suggests that the necessity for an inflationary period may be obviated. Furthermore, phonon arising from this quasicrystalline structure could act as dark matter, influencing the dynamics of ordinary matter while remaining mostly undetectable by electromagnetic interactions. This hypothesis draws parallels with other crystalline matter at atomic scales that are fundamentally quantum in nature. We also explore how the notion of tiling space can support continuous symmetry atop a discrete structure, providing a novel framework for understanding the universe's expansion and underlying structure. Consequently, it is logical to start with quantum mechanics as the foundation of our model. Further development could enhance our understanding of cosmic expansion and the underlying structure of the universe.</description>

      <title>Finite Algebraic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed quantum field theory (QFT) for particles with or without structure, called "Structural Algebraic QFT (SAQFT)", we introduce a finite QFT. That is, a QFT for structureless elementary particles that does not require renormalization where loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams are finite. It is an algebraic theory utilizing orthogonal polynomials and based on the structureless sector of SAQFT.</description>

      <title>Spacetime representation of quantum mechanics and a proposal for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional path integral quantum mechanics, the integral variables are the canonical variables of Hamiltonian mechanics. We show that these integral variables can be transformed into the spacetime metric, leading to a new representation of quantum mechanics. We show that the wave-particle duality can be interpreted as the uncertainty of spacetime for the particle. Summarizing all possible trajectories in conventional path integral quantum mechanics can be transformed into the summation of all possible spacetime metrics. We emphasize that in conventional quantum gravity, it is possible that the classical matter fields correspond to the quantum spacetime. We argue that this is not quite reasonable and propose a new path integral quantum gravity model based on the new interpretation of wave-particle duality. In this model, the aforementioned drawback of conventional quantum gravity naturally disappears.</description>

      <title>Padmanabhan's Boundary Variational Principle for Electrodynamics and Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we revisit a variational principle introduced by Padmanabhan for describing gravitation using a field action composed of a boundary term. We demonstrate that this procedure can also be applied to derive Maxwell's and Yang-Mills equations. Additionally, we find that in this boundary approach, \(\mathcal{CP}\)-violating dual couplings and spontaneous symmetry breaking through gauge boson masses emerge in a manner analogous to the appearance of the cosmological constant in the original gravitational context.</description>

      <title>A String-Graph Approach to Molecular Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: molecular geometry, the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a molecule, is fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity, physical properties, and biological activity. The prevailing models used to describe molecular geometry include the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, hybridization theory, and molecular orbital theory. While these models provide significant insights, they also have inherent limitations. Applying string theory and graph theory with topological and macrotensorial methods could improve the understanding of molecular behavior. Objective: explore the potential applications of string and graph theory to material science, focusing on molecular geometry, electron domains, and phase changes via symmetries. Molecular geometry: each molecule is associated with a simple graph with an orthonormal representation inducing metrics via the usage of macrotensor operators, allowing the calculation of angles between molecules and following the equations of motion. Phase changes: a series of inequalities are proposed depending on the energy-momentum densities of bonds and the edges of the associated graph where electrons or atoms are located, its topology, and isometries, exploring possible new states of matter. Conclusions: application of macrotensors, graphs, and string theory to material science, specifically to molecular geometry and phase changes, allows for a more dynamic and flexible description of natural phenomena involving matter and the prediction of possible new states of matter. This presents a different perspective, opening possibilities for experimental confirmation and applications of the approach presented here.</description>

      <title>Extended phase space thermodynamics of magnetized black holes with nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's gravity in AdS space coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with two parameters is studied. We investigate magnetically charged black holes. The metric and mass functions and their asymptotic are obtained showing that black holes may have one or two horizons. Thermodynamics in extended phase space was studied and it was proven that the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the generalized Smarr relation hold. The magnetic potential and the vacuum polarization conjugated to coupling (NED parameter), are computed and depicted. We calculate the Gibbs free energy and heat capacity.</description>

      <title>The holographic principle comes from finiteness of the universe's geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovered as an apparent pattern, a universal relation between geometry and information called the holographic principle has yet to be explained. This relation is unfolded in the present paper. As it is demonstrated there, the origin of the holographic principle lies in the fact that a geometry of physical space has only a finite number of points. Furthermore, it is shown that the puzzlement of the holographic principle can be explained by a magnification of grid cells used to discretize geometrical magnitudes such as areas and volumes into sets of points. To wit, when grid cells of the Planck scale are projected from the surface of the observable universe into its interior, they become enlarged. For that reason, the space inside the observable universe is described by the set of points whose cardinality is equal to the number of points that constitute the universe's surface.</description>

      <title>Fractional Particle with Fractional First Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new classical fractional particle model incorporating fractional first derivatives. This model represents a natural extension of the standard classical particle with kinetic energy being quadratic in fractional first derivatives and fractional linear momenta, similarly to classical mechanics. We derive the corresponding equations of motion and explore the symmetries of the model. Also, we present the formulation in terms of fractional potentials. Two important examples are analytically solved: the free particle and the particle subjected to generalized forces characterized by fractional first derivatives.</description>

      <title>Axion Physics from String Theory: Cosmological Signatures in Dark Matter and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to understand the nature of dark matter and dark energy motivates a deep exploration into axion physics, particularly within the framework of string theory. Axions, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem, emerge as compelling candidates for both dark matter and dark energy components of the universe. String theory, offering a unified perspective on fundamental forces, predicts a rich spectrum of axion-like particles (ALPs) arising from its compactification schemes. This paper provides a comprehensive review of axion physics within string theory, detailing their theoretical foundations, emergence from compactification processes, and roles in cosmological models. Key aspects covered include the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the structure of ALPs, their moduli stabilization, and implications for observational signatures in dark matter, dark energy, and cosmological inflation scenarios. Insights from ongoing experimental efforts and future directions in axion cosmology are also discussed</description>

      <title>Finding the more fundamental law of classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08248v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the relationship between the conservation of energy and Newton's second law or equations of motion. Differently from recent works, we show that equations of motion can be obtained only in some special cases and their results are distinct in general. This distinctiveness makes it possible to find the more fundamental law experimentally.</description>
