      <title>A KLR-like presentation for the bt-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bt-algebra ${ \mathcal E}_n(q)$ of knot theory, defined over an arbitrary field $ \Bbbk$. We find a KLR-like presentation for $ {\mathcal E}_n(q) $ showing that it is a $ \mathbb Z$-graded algebra if $ q \in \Bbbk^{\times} \setminus \{1 \} $ admits a square root in $ \Bbbk $. We introduce the ordered bt-algebra $ {\mathcal E}^{\rm{ord}}_n(q)$ and show that it also has a KLR-like presentation, without restriction on $ q \in \Bbbk^{\times} \setminus \{1 \} $. In particular, $ {\mathcal E}^{\rm{ord}}_n(q)$ is a $ \mathbb Z$-graded algebra for all $ q \in \Bbbk^{\times} \setminus \{1 \} $.</description>

      <title>The Clifford Theory for Modular Representations of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clifford theory establishes a relation between the representation theory of a finite group and its normal subgroups. In this paper, we establish the Clifford theory for the modular representations of finite groups. The proofs are based on an explicit analysis of the representation spaces and their decompositions. We also analyze the relation between the modular representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ in defining characteristic, with that of $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ using the modular Clifford theory.</description>

      <title>Steadied Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras and local models for blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's known that many different blocks of $\mathbb{F}_pS_n$ for different values of $n$ are equivalent as categories, though the corresponding block algebras are almost never isomorphic. Thus, it is a challenging problem to give one particularly nice representative of this Morita equivalence class of algebras. This has been accomplished for the case of RoCK blocks through work of Chuang--Kessar, Turner, and Evseev--Kleshchev. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this problem, applying not just to RoCK blocks of $S_n$, but also to all blocks of Ariki--Koike algebras. We do this by considering steadied quotients of KLRW algebras: these algebras are a natural generalization of cyclotomic quotients, already related to $S_n$ and Ariki--Koike algebras in work of Brundan--Kleshchev. These algebras are defined by ``tilting'' the cyclotomic relations so that we kill the two-sided ideal defined by certain configurations on the left and right sides of our diagrams. We show a Morita equivalence between these algebras and blocks of Ariki-Koike algebras generalizing the work discussed above.</description>

      <title>Statistics for random representations of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how a typical, large-dimensional representation looks for a complex Lie algebra. In particular, we study the family $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$ of Lie algebras for $r \geq 2$ and derive asymptotic probability distributions for the multiplicity of small irreducible representations, as well as the largest dimension, the largest height, and the total number of irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of a representation sampled uniformly from all representations with the same dimension. This provides a natural generalization to the similar statistical studies of integer partitions, which forms the case $r=1$ of our considerations and where one has a rich toolkit ranging from combinatorial methods to approaches utilizing the theory of modular forms. We perform our analysis by extending the statistical mechanics inspired approaches in the case of partitions to the infinite family here.</description>

      <title>The structures of simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structures of ordinary simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus. More precisely, we prove that when the ramification type is fixed and the genus is treated as a variable, the connected monotone Hurwitz number is a linear combination of products of exponentials and polynomials, and the ordinary simple Hurwitz number is a linear combination of exponentials. Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson.</description>

      <title>Ring theory in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general ring theory in the o-minimal setting culminating in a description of all the definable rings in an arbitrary o-minimal structure. We show that every definably connected ring with non-trivial multiplication defines an infinite field and it is essentially semialgebraic. A surprisingly strong correspondence between definably connected rings and finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb{R}$-algebras is established. Every ideal of a definable unital ring is definable, from which it follows that every definable unital ring is Artinian and Noetherian. If a definable ring $R$ is not unital, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to embed in a definable unital ring as an ideal. Moreover, when this is the case, we provide the smallest such definable unital ring $R^{\wedge}$, its definable unitazation.</description>

      <title>Row and column detection complexities of character tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Character tables of finite groups and closely related commutative algebras have been investigated recently using new perspectives arising from the AdS/CFT correspondence and low-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Two important elements in these new perspectives are physically motivated definitions of quantum complexity for the algebras and a notion of row-column duality. These elements are encoded in properties of the character table of a group G and the associated algebras, notably the centre of the group algebra and the fusion algebra of irreducible representations of the group. Motivated by these developments, we define row and column versions of detection complexities for character tables, and investigate the relation between these complexities under the exchange of rows and columns. We observe regularities that arise in the statistical averages over small character tables and propose corresponding conjectures for arbitrarily large character tables.</description>

      <title>On Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ were briefly called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association schemes in [9]. In this paper, the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are studied. The centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are obtained.</description>

      <title>Model structure from one hereditary complete cortorsion pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast with the Hovey correspondence of abelian model structures from two complete cotorsion pairs, Beligiannis and Reiten give a construction of model structures on abelian categories from only one complete cotorsion pair. The aim of this paper is to extend this result to weakly idempotent complete exact categories, by adding the condition of heredity of the complete cotorsion pair. In fact, even for abelian categories, this condition of heredity should be added. This construction really gives model structures which are not necessarily exact in the sense of Gillespie. The correspondence of Beligiannis and Reiten of weakly projective model structures also holds for weakly idempotent complete exact categories.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional module factorizations and complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce higher-dimensional module factorizations associated to a regular sequence. They include higher-dimensional matrix factorizations, which are commutative cubes consisting of free modules with edges being classical matrix factorizations. We characterize the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete intersection via higher-dimensional matrix factorizations over the corresponding regular local ring. The result generalizes to noncommutative rings, including quantum complete intersections.</description>
