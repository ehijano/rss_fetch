      <title>Optimized Rolling Allocation of Outages for Damage Assesment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters often inflict severe damage on distribution grids. Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled. To our knowledge, this is among the first multi-state enterprise integrated deployments to treat DA crews as a first-class optimized resource in storm restoration.</description>

      <title>Fixed-time control with prescribed performance for path following of underwater gliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.</description>

      <title>X-GridAgent: An LLM-Powered Agentic AI System for Assisting Power Grid Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.</description>

      <title>Systemization of Knowledge: Resilience and Fault Tolerance in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) now support critical infrastructure spanning transportation, energy, manufacturing, medical devices, and autonomous robotics. Their defining characteristic is the tight coupling between digital computation and continuous physical dynamics which enables sophisticated autonomy but also creates highly non-linear failure modes. Small disturbances at sensors, firmware, networks, or physical interfaces can propagate through estimation and control pipelines, producing cascading instabilities that defy traditional single-layer reasoning. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) unifies nearly two decades of CPS resilience research into a structured Origin-Layer-Effect (OLE) taxonomy. This taxonomy provides a cross-layer lens for understanding how faults arise, how they propagate, and why unrelated CPS failures often share deep structural similarities. By mapping representative systems including RockDrone, MAYDAY, M2MON, HACMS, Byzantine fault-tolerant control, and learning-based recovery mechanisms onto the taxonomy, we reveal patterns of coverage, persistent blind spots, and recurring pathways of fault amplification. Our analysis identifies four structural gaps that span multiple CPS domains: (1) physical-model manipulation, (2) ML-enabled control without stability guarantees, (3) semantic inconsistencies between formal models and firmware, and (4) inadequate forensic visibility across cyber and physical layers. These insights motivate new directions for resilient CPS design, integrating robust control, runtime monitoring, formal assurance, and system-level visibility.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Underground Pumped Hydro Energy Storage Scheduling with Decision-Focused Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES) systems play a critical role in grid-scale energy storage for renewable integration, yet optimal day-ahead scheduling remains computationally prohibitive due to nonlinear turbine performance characteristics and discrete operational modes. This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark. Thus, the presented DFL framework enables flexible prioritization between profit maximization and real-time responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Decentralized water-level balancing for irrigation channels in storage critical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A feedback control system is proposed for balancing the deviations of water levels from set-points along open channels subject to uncertain supply-demand mismatch that exceeds individual pool capacity. Decentralized controllers adjust the gate flows between pools to regulate potentially weighted differences between neighbouring water-level errors to zero in steady state. A sequential SISO loop-shaping procedure is developed for the design of each local flow controller based on distributed parameter transfer function models of the channel dynamics. Recursive feasibility of the procedure for relevant performance specifications, and stability of the resulting MIMO closed-loop, are verified by supporting analysis. Both numerical simulations and field trial results are presented.</description>

      <title>Universal Transient Stability Analysis: A Large Language Model-Enabled Dynamics Prediction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing dynamics prediction frameworks for transient stability analysis (TSA) fail to achieve multi-scenario "universality"--the inherent ability of a single, pre-trained architecture to generalize across diverse operating conditions, unseen faults, and heterogeneous systems. To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.</description>

      <title>Partitioned robustness analysis of networks with uncertain links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An input-output model for networks with link uncertainty is developed. The main result presents a set of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) that collectively imply robust stability of the uncertain network dynamics. The model dependency of each IQC is localized according to an edge-based partition of the network graph. The class of admissible network partitions affords scope for trading-off scalability against conservativeness. This is illustrated by numerical example.</description>

      <title>LSTM-Based Modeling and Reinforcement Learning Control of a Magnetically Actuated Catheter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous magnetic catheter systems are emerging as a promising approach for the future of minimally invasive interventions. This study presents a novel approach that begins by modeling the nonlinear and hysteretic dynamics of a magnetically actuated catheter system, consists of a magnetic catheter manipulated by servo-controlled magnetic fields generated by two external permanent magnets, and its complex behavior is captured using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This model validated against experimental setup's data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 mm and 99.8% coverage within 3 mm, establishing it as a reliable surrogate model. This LSTM enables the training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for controlling the system and avoiding damage to the real setup, with the potential for subsequent fine-tuning on the physical system. We implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and actor-critic RL controllers, comparing these two agents first for regulation and subsequently for path following along linear and half-sinusoidal paths for the catheter tip. The actor-critic outperforms DQN, offering greater accuracy and faster performance with less error, along with smoother trajectories at a 10 Hz sampling rate, in both regulation and path following compared to the DQN controller. This performance, due to the continuous action space, suits dynamic navigation tasks like navigating curved vascular structures for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning Modeling and Control of Non-linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling systems with complex, nonlinear dynamics poses a significant challenge, particularly in achieving efficient and robust control. In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking. The results show that our SINDy-TD3 approach achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to direct reinforcement learning techniques, highlighting the potential of combining data-driven modeling with reinforcement learning for complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation with Zonotopic Tubes: An Elastic Tube-based MPC Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an elastic tube-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for unknown discrete-time linear systems subject to disturbances. Unlike most existing elastic tube-based MPC methods, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the system model or disturbance realizations bounds. Instead, a conservative zonotopic disturbance set is initialized and iteratively refined using data and prior knowledge: data are used to identify matrix zonotope model sets for the system dynamics, while prior physical knowledge is employed to discard models and disturbances inconsistent with known constraints. This process yields constrained matrix zonotopes representing disturbance realizations and dynamics that enable a principled fusion of offline information with limited online data, improving MPC feasibility and performance. The proposed design leverages closed-loop system characterization to learn and refine control gains that maintain a small tube size. By separating open-loop model mismatch from closed-loop effects in the error dynamics, the method avoids dependence on the size of the state and input operating regions, thereby reducing conservatism. An adaptive co-design of the tube and ancillary feedback ensures $\lambda$-contractive zonotopic tubes, guaranteeing robust positive invariance, improved feasibility margins, and enhanced disturbance tolerance. We establish recursive feasibility conditions and introduce a polyhedral Lyapunov candidate for the error tube, proving exponential stability of the closed-loop error dynamics under the adaptive tube-gain updates. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness, enlarged feasibility regions, and safe closed-loop performance using only a small amount of online data.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Human-Centered Framework for Assessing Pedestrian Well-Being in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian well-being is a critical yet rarely measured component of sustainable urban mobility and livable city design. Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being. By enabling real-world, multimodal measurement of pedestrian experience, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for advancing human-centered urban analytics.</description>

      <title>ARX-Implementation of encrypted nonlinear dynamic controllers using observer form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While computation-enabled cryptosystems applied to control systems have improved security and privacy, a major issue is that the number of recursive operations on encrypted data is limited to a finite number of times in most cases, especially where fast computation is required. To allow for nonlinear dynamic control under this constraint, a method for representing a state-space system model as an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX model) is proposed. With the input as well as the output of the plant encrypted and transmitted to the controller, the reformulated ARX form can compute each output using only a finite number of operations, from its several previous inputs and outputs. Existence of a stable observer for the controller is a key condition for the proposed representation. The representation replaces the controller with an observer form and applies a method similar to finite-impulse-response approximation. It is verified that the approximation error and its effect can be made arbitrarily small by an appropriate choice of a parameter, under stability of the observer and the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-Based Small-Gain Theorem for Fixed-Time ISS: Theory, Optimization, and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Lyapunov-based small-gain theorem for establishing fixed-time input-to-state stability (FxT-ISS) guarantees in interconnected nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed framework considers interconnections in which each subsystem admits a FxT-ISS Lyapunov function, providing robustness with respect to external inputs. We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability. To illustrate the applicability of the theory, we study feedback-based optimization problems with time-varying cost functions, and Nash-equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games with nonlinear dynamical plants in the loop. For both problems, we present a class of non-smooth gradient or pseudogradient-based controllers that achieve fixed-time convergence without requiring time-scale separation and using real-time feedback. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Versatile CMOS Analog LIF Neuron for Memristor-Integrated Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous systems with analog CMOS circuits integrated with nanoscale memristive devices enable efficient deployment of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. CMOS Neuron with low footprint can emulate slow temporal dynamics by operating with extremely low current levels. Nevertheless, the current read from the memristive synapses can be higher by several orders of magnitude, and performing impedance matching between neurons and synapses is mandatory. In this paper, we implement an analog leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron with a voltage regulator and current attenuator for interfacing CMOS neurons with memristive synapses. In addition, the neuron design proposes a dual leakage that could enable the implementation of local learning rules such as voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also propose a connection scheme to implement adaptive LIF neurons based on two-neuron interaction. The proposed circuits can be used to interface with a variety of synaptic devices and process signals of diverse temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy-convergence trade off for the training of neural networks on bio-inspired hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of wearable sensors and implantable devices is shifting AI processing demands to the extreme edge, necessitating ultra-low power for continuous operation. Inspired by the brain, emerging memristive devices promise to accelerate neural network training by eliminating costly data transfers between compute and memory. Though, balancing performance and energy efficiency remains a challenge. We investigate ferroelectric synaptic devices based on HfO2/ZrO2 superlattices and feed their experimentally measured weight updates into hardware-aware neural network simulations. Across pulse widths from 20 ns to 0.2 ms, shorter pulses lower per-update energy but require more training epochs while still reducing total energy without sacrificing accuracy. Classification accuracy using plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is diminished compared to mixed-precision SGD. We analyze the causes and propose a ``symmetry point shifting'' technique, addressing asymmetric updates and restoring accuracy. These results highlight a trade-off among accuracy, convergence speed, and energy use, showing that short-pulse programming with tailored training significantly enhances on-chip learning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of a real Hilbert space we consider the problem of approaching solutions to a class of hierarchical variational inequality problems, subsuming several other problem classes including certain mathematical programs under equilibrium constraints, constrained min-max problems, hierarchical game problems, optimal control under VI constraints, and simple bilevel optimization problems. For this general problem formulation, we establish rates of convergence in terms of suitably constructed gap functions, measuring feasibility gaps and optimality gaps. We present worst-case iteration complexity results on both levels of the variational problem, as well as weak convergence under a geometric weak sharpness condition on the lower level solution set. Our results match and improve the state of the art in terms of their iteration complexity and the generality of the problem formulation.</description>

      <title>Robustness Certificates for Neural Networks against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of machine learning in safety-critical domains amplifies the risk of adversarial threats, especially data poisoning attacks that corrupt training data to degrade performance or induce unsafe behavior. Most existing defenses lack formal guarantees or rely on restrictive assumptions about the model class, attack type, extent of poisoning, or point-wise certification, limiting their practical reliability. This paper introduces a principled formal robustness certification framework that models gradient-based training as a discrete-time dynamical system (dt-DS) and formulates poisoning robustness as a formal safety verification problem. By adapting the concept of barrier certificates (BCs) from control theory, we introduce sufficient conditions to certify a robust radius ensuring that the terminal model remains safe under worst-case ${\ell}_p$-norm based poisoning. To make this practical, we parameterize BCs as neural networks trained on finite sets of poisoned trajectories. We further derive probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds by solving a scenario convex program (SCP), which yields a confidence lower bound on the certified robustness radius generalizing beyond the training set. Importantly, our framework also extends to certification against test-time attacks, making it the first unified framework to provide formal guarantees in both training and test-time attack settings. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 show that our approach certifies non-trivial perturbation budgets while being model-agnostic and requiring no prior knowledge of the attack or contamination level.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals for loss of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining stability in feedback systems, from aircraft and autonomous robots to biological and physiological systems, relies on monitoring their behavior and continuously adjusting their inputs. Incremental damage can make such control fragile. This tends to go unnoticed until a small perturbation induces instability (i.e. loss of control). Traditional methods in the field of engineering rely on accurate system models to compute a safe set of operating instructions, which become invalid when the, possibly damaged, system diverges from its model. Here we demonstrate that the approach of such a feedback system towards instability can nonetheless be monitored through dynamical indicators of resilience. This holistic system safety monitor does not rely on a system model and is based on the generic phenomenon of critical slowing down, shown to occur in the climate, biology and other complex nonlinear systems approaching criticality. Our findings for engineered devices opens up a wide range of applications involving real-time early warning systems as well as an empirical guidance of resilient system design exploration, or "tinkering". While we demonstrate the validity using drones, the generic nature of the underlying principles suggest that these indicators could apply across a wider class of controlled systems including reactors, aircraft, and self-driving cars.</description>

      <title>Energy-Gain Control of Time-Varying Systems: Receding Horizon Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard formulations of prescribed worstcase disturbance energy-gain control policies for linear time-varying systems depend on all forward model data. In a discrete-time setting, this dependence arises through a backward Riccati recursion. The aim herein is to consider the infinite-horizon $\ell_2$ gain performance of state feedback policies with only finite receding-horizon preview of the model parameters. The proposed synthesis of controllers subject to such a constraint leverages the strict contraction of lifted Riccati operators under uniform controllability and observability. The main approximation result establishes a sufficient number of preview steps for the performance loss to remain below any set tolerance, relative to the baseline gain bound of the associated infinite-preview controller. Aspects of the main result are explored in the context of a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Flocking phase transition and threat responses in bio-inspired autonomous drone swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion inspired by animal groups offers powerful design principles for autonomous aerial swarms. We present a bio-inspired 3D flocking algorithm in which each drone interacts only with a minimal set of influential neighbors, relying solely on local alignment and attraction cues. By systematically tuning these two interaction gains, we map a phase diagram revealing sharp transitions between swarming and schooling, as well as a critical region where susceptibility, polarization fluctuations, and reorganization capacity peak. Outdoor experiments with a swarm of ten drones, combined with simulations using a calibrated flight-dynamics model, show that operating near this transition enhances responsiveness to external disturbances. When confronted with an intruder, the swarm performs rapid collective turns, transient expansions, and reliably recovers high alignment within seconds. These results demonstrate that minimal local-interaction rules are sufficient to generate multiple collective phases and that simple gain modulation offers an efficient mechanism to adjust stability, flexibility, and resilience in drone swarms.</description>

      <title>Wireless Center of Pressure Feedback System for Humanoid Robot Balance Control using ESP32-C3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining stability during the single-support phase is a fundamental challenge in humanoid robotics, particularly in dance robots that require complex maneuvers and high mechanical freedom. Traditional tethered sensor configurations often restrict joint movement and introduce mechanical noises. This study proposes a wireless embedded balance system designed to maintain stability on uneven surfaces. The system utilizes a custom-designed foot unit integrated with four load cells and an ESP32-C3 microcontroller to estimate the Center of Pressure (CoP) in real time. The CoP data were transmitted wirelessly to the main controller to minimize the wiring complexity of the 29-DoF VI-ROSE humanoid robot. A PID control strategy is implemented to adjust the torso, hip, and ankle roll joints based on CoP feedback. Experimental characterization demonstrated high sensor precision with an average measurement error of 14.8 g. Furthermore, the proposed control system achieved a 100% success rate in maintaining balance during single-leg lifting tasks at a 3-degree inclination with optimized PID parameters (Kp=0.10, Kd=0.005). These results validate the efficacy of wireless CoP feedback in enhancing the postural stability of humanoid robots, without compromising their mechanical flexibility.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian Polynomials, Semipositive Cones, and Cone-Stable EVI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian and completely log-concave polynomials have recently emerged as a unifying framework for negative dependence, log-concavity, and convexity in combinatorics and probability. We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\in\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian.
  Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Multiple-Scattering Channel Modeling for Ultraviolet Communications: A Monte-Carlo Integration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of multiple-scattering channels in atmospheric turbulence is essential for the performance analysis of long-distance non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) communications. Existing works on the turbulent channel modeling for NLOS UV communications either focused on single-scattering cases or estimate the turbulent fluctuation effect in an unreliable way based on Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) approach. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive turbulent multiple-scattering channel model by using a more efficient Monte-Carlo integration (MCI) approach for NLOS UV communications, where both the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects are considered. Compared with the MCS approach, the MCI approach is more interpretable for estimating the turbulent fluctuation. To achieve this, we first introduce the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects for NLOS UV communications in turbulent channels. Then we propose the estimation methods based on MCI approach for estimating both the turbulent fluctuation and the distribution of turbulent fading coefficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the turbulence-induced scattering effect can always be ignored for typical UV communication scenarios. Besides, the turbulent fluctuation will increase as either the communication distance increases or the zenith angle decreases, which is compatible with existing experimental results and also with our experimental results. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that the distribution of the turbulent fading coefficient for UV multiple-scattering channels under all turbulent conditions can be approximated as log-normal distribution; and we also demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that the turbulent fading can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution under weak turbulence.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. In particular, privacy noises are incorporated into each agent's state and tracking variable to mitigate information leakage, after which the perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes for the step-sizes and the sampling number within the algorithm. The sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method employed by both schemes enhances the differential privacy level, and ensures a finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The algorithm achieves both almost sure and mean square convergence for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, when nonconvex objectives satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, Scheme (S1) achieves a polynomial mean square convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves an exponential mean square convergence rate. The trade-off between privacy and convergence is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing works are illustrated through numerical examples of distributed training on the benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".</description>

      <title>Network-Realised Model Predictive Control Part II: Distributed Constraint Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customisable implementations.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Integrative, Scalable and Extensible Modeling of Hydrological Systems with Model-Based Systems Engineering and Hetero-functional Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Worsening global challenges demand solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. Existing environmental models encode extensive knowledge of individual systems, yet much of this information remains isolated within domain-specific formulations and data structures. This paper introduces a unified modeling framework that formalizes information from existing process models by asserting real-world physical relationships onto their underlying mathematical representations. By integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), the framework establishes a consistent ontology that explicitly defines system structure and behavior. Illustrative hydrological examples demonstrate implementation of the methodology, showing how relationships embedded in conventional process models can be made explicit and scalable. While simplified, these examples provide a first step toward applying the approach to complex environmental systems. More broadly, the methodology offers a foundation for future modeling of systems of systems within a shared computational architecture.</description>

      <title>Improving Action Smoothness for a Cascaded Online Learning Flight Control System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04346v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Gait Transitions in Load-Pulling Quadrupeds: Insights from Sled Dogs and a Minimal SLIP Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14727v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals employ diverse galloping strategies to optimize speed, stability, and energy efficiency. However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Formation Flying Using Alternating Magnetic Field Forces and Control Barrier Functions for State and Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs. The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation control method in numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We propose an equilibrium model of ski resorts where users are assigned to cycles in a closed network. As queues form on lifts with limited capacity, we derive an efficient way to find waiting times via convex optimization.

Abstract: India achieved a significant milestone on August $23^{\text{rd}}$ 2023, becoming the fourth country to accomplish a soft landing on the Moon. This paper presents the powered descent trajectory design for the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The optimization framework is based on pseudospectral Radau collocation, and controllability-based waypoint refinement is employed to further enhance the robustness of the trajectory against state and control perturbations. Furthermore, the trade-off between fuel consumption and robustness is explicitly quantified, providing insights into the practical considerations of mission planning.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part II: Nonmodular, Inverse Optimal, Adaptive, Prescribed/Fixed-Time and Safe Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Trajectory Bundle Method for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing requires precise tension and velocity control under operational constraints. Model predictive control demands gradient computation, while sampling-based methods like MPPI struggle with hard constraint satisfaction. This paper presents an adaptive trajectory bundle method that achieves rigorous constraint handling through derivative-free sequential convex programming. The approach approximates nonlinear dynamics and costs via interpolated sample bundles, replacing Taylor-series linearization with function-value interpolation. Adaptive trust region and penalty mechanisms automatically adjust based on constraint violation metrics, eliminating manual tuning. We establish convergence guarantees proving finite-time feasibility and convergence to stationary points of the constrained problem. Simulations on a six-zone R2R system demonstrate that the adaptive method achieves 4.3\% lower tension RMSE than gradient-based MPC and 11.1\% improvement over baseline TBM in velocity transients, with superior constraint satisfaction compared to MPPI variants. Experimental validation on an R2R dry transfer system confirms faster settling and reduced overshoot relative to LQR and non-adaptive TBM.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Control Law for Low Thrust Orbit Transfer with Guaranteed Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric propulsion is used to maximize payload capacity in communication satellites. These orbit raising maneuvers span several months and hundreds of revolutions, making trajectory design a complex challenge. The literature typically addresses this problem using feedback laws, with Q-law being one of the most prominent approaches. However, Q-law suffers from closed-loop stability issues, limiting its suitability for real-time on-board implementation. In this work, we focus on closed-loop orbit raising rather than offline trajectory planning and address the stability limitations of the Q-law through a Lyapunov based control design. A Lyapunov-guided modification of the classical Q-law is proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and enable real-time implementation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through closed-loop orbit transfers across various scenarios, including co-planar transfers, equatorial to polar orbit transfers, and geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) to geostationary earth orbit (GEO) transfers.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a Safe Online Control-Informed Learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The framework unifies optimal control, parameter estimation, and safety constraints into an online learning process. It employs an extended Kalman filter to incrementally update system parameters in real time, enabling robust and data-efficient adaptation under uncertainty. A softplus barrier function enforces constraint satisfaction during learning and control while eliminating the dependence on high-quality initial guesses. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence and safety guarantees, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on cart-pole and robot-arm systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical study for the development of Multiple Sclerosis in which a spatio-temporal kinetic { theory} model describes, at the mesoscopic level, the dynamics of a high number of interacting agents. We consider both interactions among different populations of human cells and the motion of immune cells, stimulated by cytokines. Moreover, we reproduce the consumption of myelin sheath due to anomalously activated lymphocytes and its restoration by oligodendrocytes. Successively, we fix a small time parameter and assume that the considered processes occur at different scales. This allows us to perform a formal limit, obtaining macroscopic reaction-diffusion equations for the number densities with a chemotaxis term. A natural step is then to study the system, inquiring about the formation of spatial patterns through a Turing instability analysis of the problem and basing the discussion on the microscopic parameters of the model. In particular, we get spatial patterns oscillating in time that may reproduce brain lesions characteristic of different phases of the pathology.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control with Natural Images: Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Overcomplete Sparse Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal control and sequential decision making are widely used in many complex tasks. Optimal control over a sequence of natural images is a first step towards understanding the role of vision in control. Here, we formalize this problem as a reinforcement learning task, and derive general conditions under which an image includes enough information to implement an optimal policy. Reinforcement learning is shown to provide a computationally efficient method for finding optimal policies when natural images are encoded into "efficient" image representations. This is demonstrated by introducing a new reinforcement learning benchmark that easily scales to large numbers of states and long horizons. In particular, by representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code, we are able to efficiently solve an optimal control task that is orders of magnitude larger than those tasks solvable using complete codes. Theoretical justification for this behaviour is provided. This work also demonstrates that deep learning is not necessary for efficient optimal control with natural images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is quite often claimed, and correctly so, that linear methods cannot achieve global stability results for attitude control, and conversely that nonlinear control is essential in order to achieve (almost) globally stable tracking of general attitude trajectories. On account of this definitive result, and also because of the existence of powerful nonlinear control techniques, there has been relatively very little work analyzing the limits and performance of linear attitude control. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a characterization of the stability achievable for one class of linear attitude control problems, namely those leading to a constant quaternion difference. In this paper, we analytically derive a critical error angle below which linearized dynamics lead to natural marginal stability for such a system, and above which the system is unstable. The dynamics are then used to derive a locally stable linear attitude controller whose performance is validated using simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture.
  To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>
