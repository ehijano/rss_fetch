      <title>Optimal energy collection with rotational movements constraints in concentrated solar power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants based on Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTC), the Sun is tracked at discrete time intervals, with each interval representing a movement of the collector system. The act of moving heavy mechanical structures can lead to the development of cracks, bending, and/or displacements of components from their optimal optical positions. This, in turn, diminishes the overall performance of the entire system for energy capture. In this context, we introduce two combinatorial optimization problems to limit the number of tracking steps of the collector and hence the risk of failure incidents and contaminant leaks. On the one hand, the Minimum Tracking Motion (MTM)-Problem aims at detecting the minimum number of movements while maintaining the production within a given range. On the other hand, the Maximal Energy Collection (MEC)-Problem aims to achieve optimal energy production within a predetermined number of movements. Both problems are solved assuming scenarios where the energy collection function contains any number of local maximum/minimum due to optical errors of the elements in the PTCsystem. The MTM- and MEC-Problems are solved in O(n) time and O(n2mw*) time, respectively, being n the number of steps in the energy collection function, m the maximum number of movements of the solar structure, and w* the maximal amplitude angle that the structure can cover. The advantages of the solutions are shown in realistic experiments. While these problems can be solved in polynomial time, we establish the NP-hardness of a slightly modified version of the MEC-Problem. The proposed algorithms are generic and can be adapted to schedule solar tracking in other CSP systems.</description>

      <title>On Connectedness of Solutions to Integer Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer linear system (ILS) is a linear system with integer constraints. The solution graph of an ILS is defined as an undirected graph defined on the set of feasible solutions to the ILS. A pair of feasible solutions is connected by an edge in the solution graph if the Hamming distance between them is 1. We consider a property of the coefficient matrix of an ILS such that the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector. Especially, we focus on the existence of an elimination ordering (EO) of a coefficient matrix, which is known as the sufficient condition for the connectedness of the solution graph for any right-hand side vector. That is, we consider the question whether the existence of an EO of the coefficient matrix is a necessary condition for the connectedness of the solution graph for any right-hand side vector. We first prove that if a coefficient matrix has at least four rows and at least three columns, then the existence of an EO may not be a necessary condition. Next, we prove that if a coefficient matrix has at most three rows or at most two columns, then the existence of an EO is a necessary condition.</description>

      <title>A database of constructions of Hadamard matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadamard matrices of order $n$ are conjectured to exist whenever $n$ is $1$, $2$, or a multiple of $4$; a similar conjecture exists for skew Hadamard matrices. We provide constructions covering orders $\le 1208$ of all known Hadamard and skew Hadamard matrices in the open-source software SageMath. This allowed us to verify the correctness of results given in the literature. Within this range, just one order, $292$, of a skew Hadamard matrix claimed to have a known construction, required a fix.
  We also produce the up to date tables, for $n \le 2999$ (resp. $n\le 999$ for skew case), of the minimum exponents $m$ such that a (skew) Hadamard matrix of order $2^m n$ is known, improving over 100 entries in the previously published sources. We explain how tables' entries are related to Riesel numbers. As a by-product of the latter, we show that the Paley constructions of (skew-)Hadamard matrices do not work for the order $2^m 509203$, for any $m$.</description>

      <title>Complexity Issues Concerning the Quadruple Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)$, a mapping $h : V(G) \rightarrow \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace$ is called a quadruple Roman dominating function (4RDF) for $G$ if it holds the following. Every vertex $x$ such that $h(x)\in \{0,1,2, 3\}$ satisfies that $h(N[x]) = \sum_{v\in N[x]} h(v) \geq |\{y:y \in N(x) \; \text{and} \; h(y) \neq 0\}|+4$, where $N(x)$ and $N[x]$ stands for the open and closed neighborhood of $x$, respectively. The smallest possible weight $\sum_{x \in V(G)} h(x)$ among all possible 4RDFs $h$ for $G$ is the quadruple Roman domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{[4R]}(G)$.
  This work is focused on complexity aspects for the problem of computing the value of this parameter for several graph classes. Specifically, it is shown that the decision problem concerning $\gamma_{[4R]}(G)$ is NP-complete when restricted to star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, split and planar graphs. In contrast, it is also proved that such problem can be efficiently solved for threshold graphs where an exact solution is demonstrated, while for graphs having an efficient dominating set, tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the classical domination number are given. In addition, some approximation results to the problem are given. That is, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within $(1 - \epsilon) \ln |V|$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$ unless $P=NP$. An approximation algorithm for it is proposed, and its APX-completeness proved, whether graphs of maximum degree four are considered. Finally, an integer linear programming formulation for our problem is presented.</description>

      <title>On $(k,g)$-Graphs without $(g+1)$-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graph is a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ which does not contain cycles of length $g+1$. Such graphs are known to exist for all parameter pairs $k \geq 3, g \geq 3 $, and we focus on determining the orders $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ of the smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the previously studied Girth-Pair Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph in which the length of a smallest even length cycle and the length of a smallest odd length cycle are prescribed. When considering the case of an odd girth $g$, this problem also yields results towards the Cage Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We establish the monotonicity of the function $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ with respect to increasing $g$, and present universal lower bounds for the values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$. We propose an algorithm for generating all $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs on $n$ vertices, use this algorithm to determine several of the smaller values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$, and discuss various approaches to finding smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs within several classes of highly symmetrical graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative 2-matching games are a generalization of cooperative matching games, where the value function is given by maximum-weight b-matchings, for a vertex capacity vector $b \leq 2$. We show how to separate over the core of 2-matching games in polynomial time, fixing a small flaw in the literature, and prove the existence of a compact extended formulation for it.</description>

      <title>On the matching arrangement of a graph,improper weight function problem and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents examples of an application of the finite field method for the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the matching arrangement of a graph. Weight functions on edges of a graph with weights from a finite field are divided into proper and improper functions in connection with proper colorings of vertices of the matching polytope of a graph. An improper weight function problem is introduced, a proof of its NP-completeness is presented, and a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem is constructed based on the improper weight function problem.</description>

      <title>Order acceptance and scheduling in capacitated job shops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a capacitated job shop problem with order acceptance. This research is motivated by the management of a research and development project pipeline for a company in the agricultural industry whose success depends on regularly releasing new and innovative products. The setting requires the consideration of multiple problem characteristics not commonly considered in scheduling research. Each job has a given release and due date and requires the execution of an individual sequence of operations on different machines (job shop). There is a set of machines of fixed capacity, each of which can process multiple operations simultaneously. Given that typically only a small percentage of jobs yield a commercially viable product, the number of potential jobs to schedule is in the order of several thousands. Due to limited capacity, not all jobs can be started. Instead, the objective is to maximize the throughput. Namely, to start as many jobs as possible. We present a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of this problem and study how resource capacity and the option to delay jobs can impact research and development throughput. We show that the MIP formulation can prove optimality even for very large instances with less restrictive capacity constraints, while instances with a tight capacity are more challenging to solve.</description>

      <title>Better Approximation for Weighted k-Matroid Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding an independent set of maximum weight simultaneously contained in $k$ matroids over a common ground set. This $k$-matroid intersection problem appears naturally in many contexts, for example in generalizing graph and hypergraph matching problems. In this paper, we provide a $(k+1)/(2 \ln 2)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted $k$-matroid intersection problem. This is the first improvement over the longstanding $(k-1)$-guarantee of Lee, Sviridenko and Vondr\'ak (2009). Along the way, we also give the first improvement over greedy for the more general weighted matroid $k$-parity problem.
  Our key innovation lies in a randomized reduction in which we solve almost unweighted instances iteratively. This perspective allows us to use insights from the unweighted problem for which Lee, Sviridenko, and Vondr\'ak have designed a $k/2$-approximation algorithm. We analyze this procedure by constructing refined matroid exchanges and leveraging randomness to avoid bad local minima.</description>

      <title>Equitable coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two different color classes do not differ by more than one. We use $\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ to represent the class of graphs $G$ that satisfy the following conditions: for any subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality $e(H) \leq m_1 v(H)$ holds, and for any bipartite subgraph $H$ of $G$, the inequality $e(H) \leq m_2 v(H)$ holds. A graph $G$ is $\alpha$-sparse if $e(H) \leq \alpha v(H)$ for every subgraph $H$ of $G$.
  In this paper, we show that there is a small constant $r_0\in [4m_1, 6.21m_1]$ solely determined by both $m_1$ and $m_2$, such that for any graph $G\in \mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ (where the ratio $m_1/m_2$ is between $1$ and $1.8$ inclusive) with a maximum degree $\Delta(G)\geq r_0$, an equitable $r$-coloring is guaranteed for all $r\geq \Delta(G)$. By setting $m_1=m_2=\alpha$ in this result, we conclude that every $\alpha$-sparse graph $G$ has an equitable $r$-coloring for every $r\geq \Delta(G)$ provided $\Delta(G)\geq 6.21\alpha$. Consequently, the celebrated Equitable $\Delta$-Color Conjecture and Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture are verified for sparse graphs with large maximum degree.
  The local crossing number of a drawing of a graph is the largest number of crossings on a single edge, and the local crossing number of that graph is the minimum of such values among all possible drawings. As an interesting application of our main result, we confirm Equitable $\Delta$-Color Conjecture and Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture for non-planar graphs $G$ with local crossing number not exceeding $\Delta(G)^2 / 383$.</description>

      <title>On Rank-Monotone Graph Operations and Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$, with a particular focus on finding and characterizing the smallest graphs with a given $\text{LS}_+$-rank (the needed number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We introduce a generalized vertex-stretching operation that appears to be promising in generating $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs and study its properties. We also provide several new $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs, most notably the first known instances of $12$-vertex graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $4$, which provides the first advance in this direction since Escalante, Montelar, and Nasini's discovery of a $9$-vertex graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $3$ in 2006.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Correlated Knapsack Orienteering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the {\em correlated knapsack orienteering} (CSKO) problem: we are given a travel budget $B$, processing-time budget $W$, finite metric space $(V,d)$ with root $\rho\in V$, where each vertex is associated with a job with possibly correlated random size and random reward that become known only when the job completes. Random variables are independent across different vertices. The goal is to compute a $\rho$-rooted path of length at most $B$, in a possibly adaptive fashion, that maximizes the reward collected from jobs that are processed by time $W$. To our knowledge, CSKO has not been considered before, though prior work has considered the uncorrelated problem, {\em stochastic knapsack orienteering}, and {\em correlated orienteering}, which features only one budget constraint on the {\em sum} of travel-time and processing-times.
  We show that the {\em adaptivity gap of CSKO is not a constant, and is at least $\Omega\bigl(\max\sqrt{\log{B}},\sqrt{\log\log{W}}\}\bigr)$}. Complementing this, we devise {\em non-adaptive} algorithms that obtain: (a) $O(\log\log W)$-approximation in quasi-polytime; and (b) $O(\log W)$-approximation in polytime. We obtain similar guarantees for CSKO with cancellations, wherein a job can be cancelled before its completion time, foregoing its reward. We also consider the special case of CSKO, wherein job sizes are weighted Bernoulli distributions, and more generally where the distributions are supported on at most two points (2-CSKO). Although weighted Bernoulli distributions suffice to yield an $\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log B})$ adaptivity-gap lower bound for (uncorrelated) {\em stochastic orienteering}, we show that they are easy instances for CSKO. We develop non-adaptive algorithms that achieve $O(1)$-approximation in polytime for weighted Bernoulli distributions, and in $(n+\log B)^{O(\log W)}$-time for the more general case of 2-CSKO.</description>
