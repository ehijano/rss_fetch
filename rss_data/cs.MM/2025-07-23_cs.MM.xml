      <title>Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimedia recommendations aim to use rich multimedia content to enhance historical user-item interaction information, which can not only indicate the content relatedness among items but also reveal finer-grained preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-aware Diffusion-Enhanced architecture using contrastive learning paradigms (KDiffE) for multimedia recommendations. Specifically, we first utilize original user-item graphs to build an attention-aware matrix into graph neural networks, which can learn the importance between users and items for main view construction. The attention-aware matrix is constructed by adopting a random walk with a restart strategy, which can preserve the importance between users and items to generate aggregation of attention-aware node features. Then, we propose a guided diffusion model to generate strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs with less noise for constructing a knowledge-aware contrastive view, which utilizes user embeddings with an edge connected to an item to guide the generation of strongly task-relevant knowledge graphs for enhancing the item's semantic information. We perform comprehensive experiments on three multimedia datasets that reveal the effectiveness of our KDiffE and its components on various state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Differential Multimodal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small language models have gained significant popularity due to their efficiency and growing capabilities. However, incorporating additional modalities, such as vision, can exacerbate the challenge of limited context windows by introducing noise. Recent studies have highlighted that Transformer attention mechanisms often disproportionately focus on irrelevant contexts. In this work, we extend the Differential Attention mechanism, originally designed for text-only models, to the text-vision model PaliGemma. Our aim is to evaluate its ability to mitigate noisy information retrieval and reduce hallucinations. To this end, we fine-tuned the PaliGemma 3B model using LoRA, incorporating Differential Attention, and experimented with various parameter settings and configurations. We demonstrate that Differential Attention can be adapted and integrated into the fine-tuning of existing models to enhance noisy information retrieval and question-answering capabilities.</description>

      <title>LMM4Edit: Benchmarking and Evaluating Multimodal Image Editing with LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4Edit.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Patient-Modality Graph Learning with Event-Conditional Modelling of Censoring for Cancer Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the survival of cancer patients is crucial for personalized treatment. However, existing studies focus solely on the relationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully leveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during the inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality graph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer survival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to model multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance degradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to simulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing scenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore modality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play event-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored data using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate survival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data into training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase the superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of the mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various modality-missing scenarios. In addition, using the plug-and-play ECMC module, the mean C-index of 8 baselines increased by 1.3% across 5 datasets. Code of CenSurv is available at https://github.com/yuehailin/CenSurv.</description>

      <title>FISHER: A Foundation Model for Multi-Modal Industrial Signal Comprehensive Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid deployment of SCADA systems, how to effectively analyze industrial signals and detect abnormal states is an urgent need for the industry. Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we summarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems and employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between modalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals can be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a result, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal compreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER considers the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band information. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit and adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop the RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial signals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models, FISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general performance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We also investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential avenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on https://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER</description>

      <title>Music-Aligned Holistic 3D Dance Generation via Hierarchical Motion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.</description>

      <title>ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AaronZ345/MRSDrama and https://github.com/AaronZ345/ISDrama.</description>

      <title>Speech as a Multimodal Digital Phenotype for Multi-Task LLM-based Mental Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.</description>

      <title>Predictability-Aware Motion Prediction for Edge XR via High-Order Error-State Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As 6G networks are developed and defined, offloading of XR applications is emerging as one of the strong new use cases. The reduced 6G latency coupled with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and into the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery needs in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with smaller form factors. However, offloading introduces increased delays compared to local execution, primarily due to network transmission latency and queuing delays at edge servers, especially under multi-user concurrency. Despite the computational power of edge platforms, the resulting motion-to-photon (MTP) latency negatively impacts user experience. To mitigate this, motion prediction has been proposed to offset delays. Existing approaches build on either deep learning or Kalman filtering. Deep learning techniques face scalability limitations at the resource-constrained edge, as their computational expense intensifies with increasing user concurrency, while Kalman filtering suffers from poor handling of complex movements and fragility to packet loss inherent in 6G's high-frequency radio interfaces. In this work, we introduce a context-aware error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) prediction framework, which forecasts the user's head motion trajectory to compensate for MTP latency in remote XR. By integrating a motion classifier that categorizes head motions based on their predictability, our algorithm demonstrates reduced prediction error across different motion classes. Our findings demonstrate that the optimized ESKF not only surpasses traditional Kalman filters in positional and orientational accuracy but also exhibits enhanced robustness and resilience to packet loss.</description>
