      <title>Enhanced detection of circularly polarized photons with topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) are highly attractive platforms for next-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices. Spin-momentum locking of topological surface states enhance their nonlinear optical responses and sensitivities, especially to circularly polarized light. Until now, theoretical investigations of nonlinear responses in TIs have been limited to microscopic calculations on analytical continuum models, or leveraging density functional theory based Hamiltonians. In this work, we expand beyond these two approaches by employing a nonlinear Kubo formalism to calculate second-order nonlinear optical conductivity in a slab geometry using symmetry informed tight binding models that accurately reproduce the conduction, valence and topological surface bands in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our methodology enables us to study the layer resolved contribution to injection-currents coupled to the incident electric field. We demonstrate that our technique can reveal how device engineering modifies elements of the nonlinear optical response such as the circular photogalvanic effect by breaking inversion and time-reversal symmetry. We find, in line with experiments, that the photogalvanic current is sensitive to field effects, Fermi level energy, gate voltage and the energy of incident light. Our computed midwavelength infrared (mid-IR) responsivity $R \approx 0.169~\mathrm{\mu A/W}$ is comparable to reported TI and intrinsic 2D-material photodetectors. We further simulate experimentally unexplored methods to modify the circular photogalvanic effect such as proximitizing a magnetic field to one of the TI surface materials, suggesting a mechanism for optoelectronic tuning.</description>

      <title>Elastic, Quasielastic, and Superelastic Electron Scattering from Thermal Lattice Distortions in Perfect Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional treatments of electron transport, momentum relaxation within a perfect, defect free crystal is commonly assumed to require phonon creation or annihilation. Here we treat the crystal as finite and isolated, retaining the lattice center of mass (recoil) degree of freedom and enforcing conservation of total mechanical momentum alongside discrete crystal pseudomomentum. Starting from the density density form of the electron lattice interaction, we find that an electron in the interior of a perfect crystal admits strong, and in some regimes dominant, elastic momentum relaxing scattering channels, in which momentum is conserved by recoil of the lattice background without phonon excitation. In addition, we identify mixed quasielastic and superelastic channels in which phonon occupations change but do not account fully for the electron's momentum transfer. These results provide a microscopic basis for momentum relaxation that does not rely on local energy dissipation. They naturally reconcile a wide range of experimental observations, including weak localization, quantum oscillations, ultrasonic attenuation, and the separation of momentum and energy relaxation times, with predominantly elastic scattering in clean crystals. The framework clarifies how diffusive transport, including Planckian scale diffusion, can emerge from elastic dynamics in a time dependent lattice background.</description>

      <title>Energy Absorption Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Connection between Dynamical Phase Transitions and Magnetization in the 1D XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the quench dynamics of a transverse-field XY model starting from coherent Gibbs states. The results reveal that the initial strength of magnetization plays a crucial role in the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. In concrete terms, when quenching within the same phase, through the properties of observables such as Fisher zeros and magnetization, we show that the stronger the initial magnetization, the more difficult the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions. The underlying mechanism is that the strong initial magnetization provides a directional effect, which inhibits the spin flipping in the process of quantum quench, making the dynamical quantum phase transition difficult to emerge. Since dynamical quantum phase transitions can be experimentally realized in various artificial systems, we hope that the physics predicted here can be experimentally verified in tabletop platforms.</description>

      <title>Intersubband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>High bosonic Bott index and transport of multi-band topological magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons are bosonic quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems. Bosonic Bott index has been affirmed as a real-space topological invariant for a two-band ferromagnetic model. In this work,we theoretically investigate the topology and transport of magnons in a multi-band bosonic Kagome ferromagnetic model. We demonstrate the validity of the bosonic Bott indices of values larger than 1 in multi-band magnonic systems by showing the agreement with Chern numbers in the clean limit and the bulk-boundary correspondence during the topological phase transition. For the high Bott index phase, the disorder-induced topological phase transition occurs in a multi-step manner. Using a generalized Landauer-Buttiker formalism, we reveal how the magnon transport depends on Gilbert damping and disorder under coherent excitation or temperature difference. The results further justify the bosonic Bott index as a robust real-space topological invariant for multi-band magnonic systems and provide insights into the transport of topological magnons.</description>
