      <title>Beyond the Wavefunction: Qualia Abstraction Language Mechanics and the Grammar of Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formal reconstruction of quantum mechanics grounded not in external mathematical abstractions, but in the structured dynamics of subjective experience. The Qualia Abstraction Language (QAL) models physical systems as evolving streams of introspective units, structured sequences of modality, shape, and functional effect, rather than as state vectors in Hilbert space. This approach reimagines core quantum concepts: superposition becomes a form of structured ambiguity; collapse is reframed as an introspective contraction; and entanglement is modeled as semantic resonance across streams of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.</description>

      <title>Cornelis Easton:The Milky Way as a spiral galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cornelis Easton (1864-1929) became a journalist and newspaper editor. During most of his career he was active as an amateur astronomer and contributed important papers in international astronomical journals This concerned three areas. The first was mapping the Milky Way. The book, La Voie Lactee dans l'hemisphere boreal, which he published in 1893, made some impression. Since it had in addition to drawings of the surface brightness of the Milky Way, also extensive descriptions and discussions of features in the structure and a comprehensive, essentially complete, listing and discussion on everything that had ever been published on the Milky Way. Later he produce an isophotal chart and used photographs to improve the map. Easton had been struck by the idea that what he saw was actually a spiral nebula, but then seen edge-on. Considering bright and dark areas he proposed a form for the spiral in the Milky Way System with the center in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. His publications on this Theory of the Milky Way in the Astrophysical Journal in 1900 and 1913 drew much attention, although many astronomers, including Jacobus Kapteyn, kept quite some reservations.
  The third area concerned correlations between surface densities of stars and surface brightness of the Milky Way. Easton maintained that there was such a correlation for relatively bright stars. T
  There is a publication Easton failed to include in his list of his publications, namely an 1894 short article in Nature. The elliptical companion NGC205 of the Andromeda Nebula between had on in 1874 and 1889 rotated by 15 degrees. Isophote twists are responsible for the apparent rotation.
  In 1903 Kapteyn and the University of Groningen bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Easton.</description>

      <title>About testing Bell locality at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, and in the presence of both strong and electroweak interactions. Particle physics naturally provides examples of systems that consist not only of qubits but also qutrits. Quantum tomography at colliders makes possible the measurement of entanglement and the testing of Bell locality. We provide a comprehensive explanation of how this is achieved and why it offers a novel perspective on the loopholes exploited by local hidden variable models to evade Bell tests.</description>
