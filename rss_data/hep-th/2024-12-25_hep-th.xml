      <title>Remark on the Emergence of Color Superconductivity for Gauge Theories in General Spacetime Dimensions from simple Holographic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of holography for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase by considering $d$-dimensional Anti de Sitter (AdS) space instead of the traditional 6 dimensions. The corresponding dual field theory is an arbitrary confining gauge theory with $SU(N_c)$ symmetry, like quantum chromodynamics (QCD) CSC. We then use a holographic model based on Einstein-Maxwell gravity in $d$-dimensional AdS spacetime to study this phenomenon in both confinement and deconfinement phase, study the confinement$-$deconfinement phase transition and the condition for the $N_c=2$ CSC phase with $d=4$ case, one special case from arXiv:2411.05550</description>

      <title>Duality covariant curvatures for the heterotic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality covariant curvature and torsion tensors in double field theory/generalized geometry are central in analyzing consistent truncations, generalized dualities, and related integrable $\sigma$-models. They are constructed systematically with the help of a larger, auxiliary space in a procedure inspired by Cartan geometry originally proposed by Pol\'a\v{c}ek and Siegel for bosonic strings. It pivots around a maximally isotropic group that captures the generalized structure group of the physical space. We show how dropping the isotropy condition on this group allows us to describe heterotic/type I strings. As an immediate application, we construct a new family of heterotic backgrounds that interpolates between the two-dimensional cigar and trumpet backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Inflow and Gauge Group Topology in the 10d Sugimoto String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the chiral spectra on charged 1- and 5-branes in the 10d non-supersymmetric $\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ string theory (also known as the Sugimoto model), and verify that they consistently cancel the anomaly inflow induced by a Green--Schwarz mechanism in the bulk. By analyzing the $\mathfrak{sp}(16)$ representations arising from quantizing the fermion zero modes on these branes as well as uncharged 4-branes, we find compelling evidence that the global structure of the gauge group is $Sp(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$. We further comment on a possible duality to non-supersymmetric heterotic strings, and explore bottom-up anomaly inflow constraints for 10d effective $Sp(16)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories coupled to gravity.</description>

      <title>A landscape of 4d N=1 SCFTs with a=c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a landscape of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) with identical central charges. These theories are obtained by renormalization group flows triggered by supersymmetry-preserving superpotential deformations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauging of the flavor symmetry of a collection of $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\mathcal{D}_p(G)$ Argyres--Douglas SCFTs. In this work, we focus on the fixed points in the landscape of the $SU(3)$ gauging of three copies of the $\mathcal{D}_2(SU(3)) = H_2$ theory together with an adjoint-valued chiral multiplet. We catalogue the network of $a = c$ fixed points, and, along the way, we find a variety of dualities and instances of supersymmetry enhancement.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit duality-covariant higher-derivative corrections which arise from the generalized Bergshoeff-de Roo (gBdR) identification, a prescription that gives rise to a two parameter family of $\alpha'$-corrections to the low-energy effective action of the bosonic and the heterotic string. Although it is able to reproduce all corrections at the leading and sub-leading ($\alpha'^2$) order purely from symmetry considerations, a geometric interpretation, like for the two-derivative action and its gauge transformation is lacking. To address this issue and to pave the way for the future exploration of higher-derivative (=higher-loop for the $\beta$-functions of the underlying $\sigma$-model) corrections to generalized dualities, consistent truncations and integrable $\sigma$-models, we recover the gBdR identification's results from the \PS{} construction that provides a natural notion of torsion and curvature in generalized geometry.</description>

      <title>Analytic bootstrap bounds on masses and spins in gravitational and non-gravitational scalar theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytic constraints on the weakly-coupled spectrum of theories with a massless scalar under the standard assumptions of the S-matrix bootstrap program. These bootstrap bounds apply to any theory (with or without gravity) with fully crossing symmetric (i.e. $stu$-symmetric) four-point amplitudes and generalize results for color- or flavor-ordered (i.e. $su$-symmetric) planar amplitudes recently proved by one of the authors. We assume that the theory is weakly-coupled below some cut-off, that the four-point massless scalar amplitude is polynomially-bounded in the Regge limit, and that this amplitude exchanges states with a discrete set of masses and a finite set of spins at each mass level. The spins and masses must then satisfy ``Sequential Spin Constraints" (SSC) and ``Sequential Mass Constraints" (SMC). The SSC requires the lightest spin-$j$ state to be lighter than the lightest spin-$(j+1)$ state (in the $su$-symmetric case) or the lightest spin-$(j+2)$ state (in the $stu$-symmetric case). The SMC requires the mass of the lightest spin-$j$ state to be smaller than some non-linear function of the masses of lower-spin states. Our results also apply to super-gluon and super-graviton amplitudes stripped of their polarization dependence. In particular, the open and closed superstring spectra saturate the SSC with maximum spins ${J_{n,\text{open}} = n+1}$ and ${J_{n,\text{closed}} = 2n+2}$, respectively, at the $n^\text{th}$ mass level.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Branches in 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using ideas from the gauge theory approach to the geometric Langlands program, we revisit supersymmetric localization with monopole operators in 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric gauge theories subject to $\Omega$-deformation. The key novel feature of our setup is a pair of dual boundary conditions, which drastically simplify the dynamics of the theory and the nature of the localization loci. From a careful calculation with these boundary conditions, the mathematical definition of Coulomb branches proposed by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima emerges naturally. It is straightforward to incorporate codimension two defects in the setup, and in this way we gain insight into Webster's construction of tilting bundles on Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>Spinning quadrupoles in effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the two independent parity-even cubic interactions $I_1 = {R^{\alpha \beta}}_{\mu \nu} {R^{\mu \nu}}_{\rho \sigma} {R^{\rho \sigma}}_{\alpha \beta}$ and $ G_3 = I_1 -2 {R^{\mu \nu \alpha}}_\beta {R^{\beta \gamma}}_{\nu \sigma} {R^\sigma}_{\mu \gamma \alpha}$ on the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted in the quasi-circular inspiral phase of the merger of two spinning objects. Focusing on the aligned spin configuration, we extract the corrections to Newton's potential at linear order in the perturbations, using the four-point amplitude of the massive spinning objects evaluated in the Post-Minkowskian expansion. We then derive the modifications to the quadrupole moments at leading order in the cubic perturbations, using a five-point amplitude with emission of a soft graviton. These modified moments, along with the corresponding potentials, are then employed to calculate the power emitted by gravitational waves during the inspiral phase. Using these results, we determine the changes to the waveforms, up to linear order in spin, in the Stationary Phase Approximation. Finally, we comment on the relation between cubic and tidal perturbations.</description>

      <title>Two-loop MHV Form Factors from the Periodic Wilson Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss how to compute maximal-helicity-violating (MHV) form factors for the chiral part of the stress-tensor supermultiplet from periodic light-like polygon Wilson loops in the planar $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory beyond the one-loop level. We show that the periodicity imposes path ordering on points on different edges, which explains the appearance of square roots coming from non-planar Feynman diagrams. Taking into account such diagrams, we provide the integrand of the two-loop $n$-particle MHV form factor, compute all diagrams, prove the cancellation of divergence and finally compute the two-loop 5-particle and 6-particle form factors as examples.</description>

      <title>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</description>

      <title>Extended Near Horizon Symmetries of Extremal BTZ Black Holes in 3D Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic symmetries of near-horizon extremal BTZ black holes in higher derivative theories of gravity, such as New Massive Gravity and Topological Massive Gravity. By employing a particular boundary condition and the regularization prescription proposed earlier for the Einstein gravity, we demonstrate the existence of two centrally extended Virasoro algebras. The central charges evaluated within this framework are in agreement with their corresponding expressions evaluated at the spatial infinity. We also discuss the robustness of the regularization procedure by relating asymptotic and near-horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Putting aside whether there is a physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have rapidly developed in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, they cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as {\it HHLL block} and {\it monodromy method}, and important results that have become proper nouns, such as {\it Hellerman bound} and {\it HKS bound}.</description>

      <title>Vortex shedding patterns in holographic superfluids at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of superfluid systems exhibit significant similarities to their classical counterparts, particularly in the phenomenon of vortex shedding triggered by a moving obstacle. In such systems, the universal behavior of shedding patterns can be classified using the classical concept of the Reynolds number $Re=\frac{v \sigma}{\nu}$ (characteristic length scale $\sigma$, velocity $v$ and viscosity $\nu$), which has been shown to generalize to quantum systems at absolute zero temperature. However, it remains unclear whether this universal behavior holds at finite temperatures, where viscosity arises from two distinct sources: thermal excitations and quantum vortex viscosity. Using a holographic model of finite-temperature superfluids, we investigate the vortex shedding patterns and identify two distinct regimes without quantum counterparts: a periodic vortex dipole pattern and a vortex dipole train pattern. By calculating the shedding frequency, Reynolds number, and Strouhal number, we find that these behaviors are qualitatively similar to empirical observations in both classical and quantum counterparts, which imply the robustness of vortex shedding dynamics at finite-temperature superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Nested Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a symmetry on the structure of angular momentum which interchanges internal and external degrees of freedom. The spin-orbit duality is a holographic map that projects a massive theory in four-dimensional flat spacetime onto the three-dimensional $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ null infinity. This cylinder has radius $R\sim1/m$ and, quantum-mechanically, its vacuum state is a fuzzy sphere. Progress shows that, first, this duality realizes the Hopf map, a fact manifest on the superparticle. Secondly, the bulk Poincar\`e group transforms into the conformal group on the cylinder. In fact, the general version of the duality yields that the dual symmetries include the BMS group, as is appropriate at null infinity. As an example, the Landau levels in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are shown to match those of a Dirac monopole on the dual $\mathbb{S}^2$, in the thermodynamic limit. This dual system is actually identified with a three-dimensional critical Ising model. The map is then realized on $N_f$ massive fermions in flat space which, indeed, are the hologram of $2N_f$ massless fermions on the cylinder. However, the dual space is really the conformal class of $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$, naturally enclosing the universal cover of a conformally compactified AdS$_4$ spacetime. We argue that, in the absence of interactions, the massless fermions on the conformal boundary are in turn dual to $N_f$ massive fermions in AdS$_4$. For free fermions, all path integrals $-$the ones in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and AdS$_4-$ are shown to match. Hence, AdS/CFT duality emerges into a larger context, where one holography nests inside the other, suggesting a complete holographic bridge between fields in flat space and the AdS superstring.</description>

      <title>The compactified D-brane cylinder amplitude and T duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address how to implement T duality to the closed string tree cylinder amplitude between a Dp brane and a Dp$'$ brane with $p - p' = 2 \,n$. For this, we first compute the closed string tree cylinder amplitude between these two D branes with common longitudinal and transverse circle compactifications. We then show explicitly how to perform a T duality to this amplitude along either a longitudinal or a transverse compactified direction to both branes. In the decompactification limit, we show that either the compactified cylinder amplitude or the T dual compactified cylinder one gives the known non-compactified one as expected.</description>

      <title>Deforming the Double Liouville String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the double Liouville theory, which can be thought of as a two-parameter family of marginal deformations of the so-called Virasoro Minimal String (VMS). The latter consists of a timelike ($c_{-}&lt;1$) and a spacelike ($c_{+}&gt;25$) Liouville field theory formulated on a fluctuating Riemann surface. For the deformed theory, we compute the sphere partition function exactly in $1/c_{\pm}$ and at third order in the coupling constant ($\lambda $) that controls the deformation. We also discuss the analogous computation in the case of the Complex Liouville String (CLS) theory, which is defined as two spacelike Liouville theories with complex central charges $c_{\pm }=13\pm i\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$. We show that the partition functions of VMS and CLS differ at leading order in $\lambda $ due to the presence of elliptic functions in the observables of the latter. Both VMS and CLS theories have recently been studied in relation to many interesting models, including the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, matrix models, and de Sitter gravity in 2 and 3 dimensions. We comment on the interpretation of the marginal deformation in some of these contexts.</description>

      <title>Komar charge of N = 2 supergravity and its superspace generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the defining equations for a Killing vector and its superpartner (called the generalized Killing spinor) and use them to construct the generalized Komar superform of minimal N=2, d=4 supergravity using the superspace formulation. The superspace procedure presented here can be used for the construction of generalized Komar forms in more general supergravity theories. We also present the (more cumbersome) calculation of the generalized Komar 2-form and of the on-shell closed 2-form used to prove the first law in the component formalism, as an independent confirmation of our main result.</description>

      <title>The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction $\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the path-integral formulation of $\psi$, due to the infinite choices of path-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each choice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of the quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, including all corrections in $\hbar$. Additionally, we impose Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\mu$, which appears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\Psi=\sqrt{\mu}\, \psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the initial path-integral prescription. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.</description>

      <title>Flowery Horizons &amp; Bulk Observers: $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Drive in $2d$ Holographic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore and analyze bulk geometric aspects corresponding to a driven two-dimensional holographic CFT, where the drive Hamiltonian is constructed from the $sl^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. In particular, we demonstrate that starting with a thermal initial state, the evolution of the event horizon is characterized by distinct geometric transformations in the bulk which are associated to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding transformations on the CFT. Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into an oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating) behaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary), all as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit symmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event horizon that displays a $U(1) \to {\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the $q\to \infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored. Furthermore, by analyzing the integral curves generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors, we also demonstrate how the fixed points of these curves approximate a bulk Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponding to a modular Hamiltonian for a sub-region in the CFT. Since the CFT modular Hamiltonian has an infinitely many in-equivalent extensions in the bulk, the fixed points of the integral curves can also lie outside the entanglement wedge of the CFT sub-region.</description>

      <title>Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonequilibrium states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the ``crosscap quench'', to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce nonabelian analogs of shift operators in the enumerative theory of quasimaps. We apply them on the one hand to strengthen the emerging analogy between enumerative geometry and the geometric theory of automorphic forms, and on the other hand to obtain results about quantized Coulomb branch algebras. In particular, we find a short and direct proof that the equivariant convolution homology of the affine Grassmannian of $GL_n$ is a quotient of a shifted Yangian.</description>

      <title>Exotic phase transitions in spin ladders with discrete symmetries that emulate spin-1/2 bosons in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spin ladder with discrete symmetries designed to emulate a two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson system at half-filling. Using global properties, such as the structure of topological defects, we establish a correspondence between the two systems and construct a dictionary of symmetries and operators. In particular, translation invariance leads to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for both systems, resulting in exotic deconfined quantum critical points. Subsequently, we study the spin ladder in detail. An exact duality transformation maps it onto a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory of three partons, analogous to the U(1) gauge theory of chargons and spinons in two-dimensional spin-1/2 boson systems. With the mapping between spins and partons, we construct exactly solvable models for all pertinent symmetry-breaking phases and analyze their transitions. We further make connections between our exact analysis and conventional parton gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the three known types of static solutions proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG), the first two have been extensively investigated, whereas the third type-which preserves general covariance, is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained-remains relatively unexplored. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. In this paper, we focus on the third type and show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter-unlike in the first two types. However, when we account for both the shadow and the lensing ring, the overall behavior closely resembles that of the second type, in which an increasing quantum parameter leads to a larger portion of the lensing ring being occupied by the shadow. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts. Remarkably, the parameter ranges under which the solution remains a black hole are highly consistent with the current observational constraints on black hole shadows, lending strong support to the classification of the third type of compact object in EQG as a black hole endowed with an event horizon.</description>

Abstract: We present the complete solution to the classification problem regarding the variational symmetries of the generalized Brans-Dicke cosmological model in the presence of a second scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and the generalized Brans-Dicke scalar field theory. Through the symmetry analysis, we were able to specify the functional form of the field equations such that they become integrable. Additionally, new families of integrable cosmological models are presented.</description>

      <title>Large and small hierarchies from finite modular symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli stabilization by the radiative corrections due to the moduli dependent vector-like masses invariant under the finite modular symmetry. The radiative stabilization mechanism can stabilize the modulus $\tau$ of the finite modular symmetry $\Gamma_N$ ($N \in \mathbb{N}$) at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau \gg 1$, where the shift symmetry $\tau \to \tau+1$ remains unbroken approximately. The shift symmetry can be considered as the residual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry which realizes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with the hierarchy parameter $e^{- 2\pi \mathrm{Im}\,\tau/N} \ll 1$. In this work, we study the stabilization of multiple moduli fields, so that various hierarchical values of the modular forms coexist in a model. For example, one modulus stabilized at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau_1 \sim 3$ is responsible for the hierarchical structure of the quarks and leptons in the Standard Model, and another modulus stabilized at $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau_2 \sim 15$ can account for the flatness of the $\mathrm{Re}\,\tau_2$ direction which may be identified as the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretic approach to flat polymerized membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the pullback trivialization technique to systematically construct gapped interfaces and anomalous boundaries for fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) states by extending their symmetry group $G_f = \mathbb{Z}_2^f \times_{\omega_2} G$ to larger groups. These FSPT states may involve decoration layers of both Majorana chains and complex fermions. We derive general consistency formulas explicitly for (2+1)D and (3+1)D systems, where nontrivial twists arise from fermionic symmetric local unitaries or "gauge transformations" that ensure coboundaries vanish at the cochain level. Additionally, we present explicit example for a (3+1)D FSPT with symmetry group $G_f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f \times \mathbb{Z}_4 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$ with Majorana chain decorations.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local universal Mumford form on a product of Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Virasoro algebra. The existence of this universal Mumford form furthers the proposal that the Sato Grassmannian provides a universal moduli space with applications to string theory. Our approach using the Virasoro flow is an alternative to using the KP flow, which in particular allows for a bosonic universal Mumford form to be constructed. Applying the same method, we construct a local universal super Mumford form on a product of super Sato Grassmannians using the flow of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra.</description>

Abstract: In 1987, Albert Schwarz suggested a formula which extends the super Mumford form from the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces into the super Sato Grassmannian. His formula is a remarkably simple combination of super tau functions. We compute the Neveu-Schwarz action on super tau functions, and show that Schwarz's extended Mumford form is invariant under the the super Heisenberg-Neveu-Schwarz action, which strengthens Schwarz's proposal that a locus within the Grassmannian can serve as a universal moduli space with applications to superstring theory. Along the way, we construct the Neveu-Schwarz, super Witt, and super Heisenberg formal groups.</description>

      <title>Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z&gt;1}$.</description>

      <title>Fixing three dimensional geometries from entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.01355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method of fixing the leading behaviors of three dimensional geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies. We employ only the holographic principle and do not use any assumption about the AdS/CFT correspondence and bulk geometry. Our strategy involves using both UV and IR-like CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies to fix the bulk geodesics. With a simple trick, the metric can be extracted from the geodesics. As examples, we fix the leading behaviors of the pure AdS$_3$ metric from the entanglement entropies of free CFT$_2$ and, more importantly, the BTZ black hole from the entanglement entropies of finite temperature CFT$_2$. Consequently, CFT$_2$ with finite size or topological defects can be determined through simple transformations. Following the same steps, in principle, the leading behaviors of all three dimensional (topologically distinct) holographic classical geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies can be fixed.</description>

      <title>Looking through the QCD Conformal Window with Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.01742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conformal window of QCD using perturbation theory, starting from the perturbative upper edge and going down as much as we can towards the strongly coupled regime. We do so by exploiting the available five-loop computation of the $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ $\beta$-function and employing Borel resummation techniques both for the ordinary perturbative series and for the Banks-Zaks conformal expansion. Large-$n_f$ results are also used. We argue that the perturbative series for the $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ $\beta$-function is most likely asymptotic and non-Borel resummable, yet Borel resummation techniques allow to improve on ordinary perturbation theory. We find substantial evidence that QCD with $n_f=12$ flavours flows in the IR to a conformal field theory. Though the evidence is weaker, we find indications that also $n_f=11$ might sit within the conformal window. We also compute the value of the mass anomalous dimension $\gamma$ at the fixed point and compare it with the available lattice results. The conformal window might extend for lower values of $n_f$, but our methods break down for $n_f&lt;11$, where we expect that non-perturbative effects become important. A similar analysis is performed in the Veneziano limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse higher-spin theory with general coupling constant $\eta$ at the second order, focusing on the gauge non-invariant vertices $\Upsilon(\omega,\omega)$, $\Upsilon(\Omega,\omega,C)$ and $\Upsilon(\omega,C)$, that are shown to generate nontrivial currents in the Fronsdal equations. Explicit expressions for the currents are found in the frame-like formalism counterpart of the TT gauge worked out in the paper. The nonlinear higher-spin theory is shown to generate all types of Metsaev's currents with the coupling constants manifestly expressed via the complex coupling constant $\eta$ of the higher-spin theory. It is shown that all currents in the higher-spin theory are conformal in the TT gauge except for those bilinear in the higher-spin gauge fields $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. We calculated the potential barriers between superfluson flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index. A tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The auxiliary field sigma model (AFSM) has recently been constructed by Ferko and Smith as deformations of the principal chiral model by including auxiliary fields and the potential term given by an arbitrary univariate function. This AFSM provides an infinite family of integrable sigma models including the original $T\overline{T}$-deformation and the root $T\overline{T}$-deformation. In this paper, we propose a 4D Chern-Simons (CS) theory with auxiliary fields. Then the AFSM is derived from this CS theory with the twist function for the principal chiral model by imposing appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and auxiliary fields. We also derive the AFSM with the Wess-Zumino term by deforming the twist function and modifying the boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the false-vacuum decay rate in one-dimensional quantum mechanics on the basis of the saddle-point approximation in the Euclidean path integral at finite temperature. The saddle points are the finite-T and shifted bounce solutions, which are finite-period analogs of the (zero-temperature) bounce solution, and the shot solutions. We re-examined the zero-temperature result by Callan and Coleman and compare with the zero-temperature limit of our results. We also perform some numerical calculations to illustrate the temperature dependence of the decay rate and compare it with the result by Affleck.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown by Danielson-Satishchandran-Wald (DSW) that for the massive or charged body in a quantum spatial separated superposition state, the presence of a black hole can decohere the superposition inevitably towards capturing the radiation of soft photons or gravitons. In this work, we study the DSW decoherence effect for the static charged body in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By calculating the decohering rate for this case, it is shown that the superposition is decohered by the low frequency photons that propagate through the black hole horizon. For the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the decoherence of quantum superposition is completely suppressed due to the black hole Meissner effect.It is also found that the decoherence effect caused by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is equivalent to that of an ordinary matter system with the same size and charge.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $% SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result, while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector, and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$, only the vector submultiplet and the singlet tensor field manifest in the observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order masses. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin, some $SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

Abstract: New dilaton Weyl multiplets are constructed in four and five space-time dimensions for $N=4$ and $N=2$ conformal supergravity respectively. They are constructed from a mixture of the old dilaton weyl multiplets with an on-shell vector multiplet. The old dilaton Weyl multiplets have a $USp(4)$ R-symmetry group whereas the new multiplets have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ R-symmetry, which is a subgroup of $USp(4)$. In six dimensions, for the first time we construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $(2,0)$ conformal supergravity from a mixture of the standard Weyl multiplet and a tensor multiplet. The R-symmetry group for the dilaton Weyl multiplet in six dimensions is also $SU(2)\times SU(2)$.</description>

      <title>Construction of $G_2$ symmetry in a Hubbard-type model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the smallest exceptional Lie group and the automorphism group of the non-associative algebra octonions, $G_2$ is often employed for describing exotic symmetry structures. We construct $G_2$ symmetry in a self-dual Hubbard-type model with 4-component fermions in a bipartite lattice, which lies in the intersection of two $SO(7)$ algebras connected by the structure constants of octonions. Depending on the representations of the order parameters, the $G_2$ symmetry can be spontaneously broken into either an $SU(3)$ one associated with an $S^6$ sphere Goldstone manifold, or, into $SU(2)\times U(1)$ with a Grassmannian Goldstone manifold. In the quantum disordered states, quantum fluctuations generate the effective $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge theories for low energy fermions.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <title>Stability of $f(Q, B)$ Gravity via Dynamical System Approach: a Comprehensive Bayesian Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological stability of $f(Q, B)$ gravity using a dynamical system approach, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ represents the boundary term. We determine the model parameters of $f(Q, B)$ through Bayesian statistical analysis, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. This analysis incorporates numerical solutions and observational data from cosmic chronometers, the extended Pantheon$^+$ data set, and baryonic acoustic oscillation measurements. Our findings reveal a stable critical point within the dynamical system of the model, corresponding to the de Sitter phase, which is consistent with current observations of the Universe dominated by dark energy and undergoing late-time accelerated expansion. Additionally, we utilize Center Manifold Theory to examine the stability of this critical point, providing deeper insights into the behavior of the model. The cosmological implications of $f(Q, B)$ gravity indicate a smooth transition in the deceleration parameters from deceleration to the acceleration phase, underscoring the potential of the model to describe the evolution of the Universe. Our results suggests that the $f(Q, B)$ model presents a viable alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, effectively capturing the observed acceleration of the Universe and offering a robust framework for explaining the dynamics of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite-group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be abelian or non-abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-abelian finite-group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We continue exploring the Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group generating evolution in frequency of physical observables. In this paper we study the evolution of the total cross section for dilute-dilute scattering retaining only eikonal emissions. We derive and analyze the analog of the BFKL equation in this framework. The frequency evolution has a very strong effect on the solutions of the BO-BFKL equation, slowing down the evolution of the scattering amplitude in a spectacular fashion: the intercept of the Pomeron is decreased by about a factor of three relative to the canonical LO BFKL result. The anomalous dimension is also modified significantly - from the BFKL value of one it goes down to the negative value of $\approx-0.2$. Introducing saturation boundary as a proxy for the full saturation dynamics, we find that the dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity $\eta$ becomes quite weak with $Q^2_s\sim e^{a\bar\alpha_s\eta}$ with $a\approx 0.784$ as opposed to the BFKL value $a=4.88$. Our results underscore the necessity to take into account the DGLAP effects in the high energy evolution. This is left for future work.</description>
