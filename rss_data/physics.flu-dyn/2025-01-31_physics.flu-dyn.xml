      <title>The origin of vorticity in viscous incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In inviscid, incompressible flows, the evolution of vorticity is exactly equivalent to that of an infinitesimal material line-element, and hence vorticity can be traced forward or backward in time in a Lagrangian fashion. This elegant and powerful description is not possible in viscous flows due to the action of diffusion. Instead, a stochastic Lagrangian interpretation is required and was recently introduced, where the origin of vorticity at a point is traced back in time as an expectation over the contribution from stochastic trajectories. We herein introduce for the first time an Eulerian, adjoint-based approach to quantify the back-in-time origin of vorticity in viscous, incompressible flows. The adjoint variable encodes the advection, tilting and stretching of the earlier-in-time vorticity that ultimately leads to the target value. Precisely, the adjoint vorticity is the volume-density of the mean Lagrangian deformation of the earlier vorticity. The formulation can also account for the injection of vorticity into the domain at solid boundaries. We demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of the adjoint approach and the stochastic Lagrangian approach. We then provide an example from turbulent channel flow, where we analyze the origin of high-stress events and relate them to Lighthill's mechanism of stretching of near-wall vorticity.</description>

      <title>Statistical Estimates for 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical features of homogeneous, isotropic, two-dimensional stochastic turbulence are discussed. We derive some rigorous bounds for the mean value of the bulk energy dissipation rate $\mathbb{E} [\varepsilon ]$ and enstrophy dissipation rates $\mathbb{E} [\chi] $ for 2D flows sustained by a variety of stochastic driving forces. We show that $$\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon ] \rightarrow 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\mbox{and} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathbb{E} [ \chi ] \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$$ in the inviscid limit, consistent with the dual-cascade in 2D turbulence.</description>

      <title>Enhanced State Estimation for turbulent flows combining Ensemble Data Assimilation and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel strategy is proposed to improve the accuracy of state estimation and reconstruction from low-fidelity models and sparse data from sensors. This strategy combines ensemble Data Assimilation (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) tools, exploiting their complementary features. ML techniques rely on the data produced by DA methods during analysis phases to train physics-informed corrective algorithms, which are then coupled with the low-fidelity models when data from sensors is unavailable. The methodology is validated via the analysis of the turbulent plane channel flow test case for $Re_\tau \approx 550$. Here, the low-fidelity model consists of coarse-grained simulations coupled with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), while observation is sampled by a highly refined body-fitted calculation. The analysis demonstrates the capabilities of the algorithm based on DA and ML to accurately predict the flow features with significantly reduced computational costs. This approach exhibits potential for future synergistic applications of DA and ML, leveraging the robustness and efficiency of ML models alongside the physical interpretability ensured by DA algorithms.</description>

      <title>A weakly compressible SPH method for RANS simulation of wall-bounded turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method for solving the two-equation Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. The turbulent wall-bounded flow with or without mild flow separation, a crucial flow pattern in engineering applications, yet rarely explored in the SPH community, is simulated. The inconsistency between the Lagrangian characteristic and RANS model, mainly due to the intense particle shear and near-wall discontinuity, is firstly revealed and addressed by the mainstream and nearwall improvements, respectively. The mainstream improvements, including Adaptive Riemann-eddy Dissipation (ARD) and Limited Transport Velocity Formulation (LTVF), address dissipation incompatibility and turbulent kinetic energy over-prediction issues. The nearwall improvements, such as the particle-based wall model realization, weighted near-wall compensation scheme, and constant $y_p$ strategy, improve the accuracy and stability of the adopted wall model, where the wall dummy particles are still used for future coupling of solid dynamics. Besides, to perform rigorous convergence tests, an level-set-based boundary-offset technique is developed to ensure consistent $y^+$ across different resolutions. The benchmark wall-bounded turbulent cases, including straight, mildly- and strongly-curved, and Half Converging and Diverging (HCD) channels are calculated. Good convergence is, to our best knowledge, firstly achieved for both velocity and turbulent kinetic energy for the SPH-RANS method. All the results agree well with the data from the experiments or simulated by the Eulerian methods at engineering-acceptable resolutions. The proposed method bridges particle-based and mesh-based RANS models, providing adaptability for other turbulence models and potential for turbulent fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-assisted vorticity production in decaying acoustic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vorticity production in isothermal, subsonic, acoustic (nonvortical), decaying turbulence due to the presence of magnetic fields. Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we always find that the resulting turbulent kinetic energy cascade follows the ordinary Kolmogorov phenomenology involving a constant spectral energy flux. For acoustic turbulence, the corresponding nondimensional prefactor is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to an inefficiency in dissipating kinetic energy. We find that the Lorentz force can not only drive the direct production of vortical motions, but it can also facilitate the conversion of acoustic energy into vortical energy. This conversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear in the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical motions by the magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our results suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity production in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant acoustic turbulence is prevalent. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the early universe, where magnetic fields may convert acoustic turbulence generated during cosmological phase transitions into vortical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Comparison of lubrication theory and Stokes flow models in step bearings with flow separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients. Flow separation and corner flow recirculation in step bearings are explored further; we consider the effect of smoothing large gradients in the surface geometry in order to recover limits under which the lubrication and Stokes approximations converge.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning optimized vertical-axis wind turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of renewable energy due to their unique advantages over traditional horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs). However, traditional VAWTs including Darrieus and Savonius types suffer from significant drawbacks -- negative torque regions exist during rotation. In this work, we propose a new design of VAWT, which combines design principles from both Darrieus and Savonius but addresses their inherent defects. The performance of the proposed VAWT is evaluated through numerical simulations and validated by experimental testing. The results demonstrate that its power output is approximately three times greater than that of traditional Savonius VAWTs of comparable size. The performance of the proposed VAWT is further optimized using machine learning techniques, including Gaussian process regression and neural networks, based on extensive supercomputer simulations. This optimization leads to a 30% increase in power output.</description>

      <title>Pressure Field Reconstruction with SIREN: A Mesh-Free Approach for Image Velocimetry in Complex Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for pressure field reconstruction from image velocimetry data using SIREN (Sinusoidal Representation Network), emphasizing its effectiveness as an implicit neural representation in noisy environments and its mesh-free nature. While we briefly assess two recently proposed methods - one-shot matrix-omnidirectional integration (OS-MODI) and Green's function integral (GFI) - the primary focus is on the advantages of the SIREN approach. The OS-MODI technique performs well in noise-free conditions and with structured meshes but struggles when applied to unstructured meshes with high aspect ratio. Similarly, the GFI method encounters difficulties due to singularities inherent from the Newtonian kernel. In contrast, the proposed SIREN approach is a mesh-free method that directly reconstructs the pressure field, bypassing the need for an intrinsic grid connectivity and, hence, avoiding the challenges associated with ill-conditioned cells and unstructured meshes. This provides a distinct advantage over traditional mesh-based methods. Moreover, it is shown that changes in the architecture of the SIREN can be used to filter out inherent noise from velocimetry data. This work positions SIREN as a robust and versatile solution for pressure reconstruction, particularly in noisy environments characterized by the absence of mesh structure, opening new avenues for innovative applications in this field.</description>

      <title>On the removal of the barotropic condition in helicity studies of the compressible Euler and ideal compressible MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The helicity is a topological conserved quantity of the Euler equations which imposes significant constraints on the dynamics of vortex lines. In the compressible setting the conservation law only holds under the assumption that the pressure is barotropic. We show that by introducing a new definition of helicity density $h_{\rho}=(\rho\textbf{u})\cdot\mbox{curl}\,(\rho\textbf{u})$ this assumption on the pressure can be removed, although $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ is no longer conserved. However, we show for the non-barotropic compressible Euler equations that the new helicity density $h_{\rho}$ obeys an entropy-type relation (in the sense of hyperbolic conservation laws) whose flux $\textbf{J}_{\rho}$ contains all the pressure terms and whose source involves the potential vorticity $q = \omega \cdot \nabla \rho$. Therefore the rate of change of $\int_V h_{\rho}dV$ no longer depends on the pressure and is easier to analyse, as it only depends on the potential vorticity and kinetic energy as well as $\mbox{div}\,\textbf{u}$. This result also carries over to the inhomogeneous incompressible Euler equations for which the potential vorticity $q$ is a material constant. Therefore $q$ is bounded by its initial value $q_{0}=q(\textbf{x},\,0)$, which enables us to define an inverse resolution length scale $\lambda_{H}^{-1}$ whose upper bound is found to be proportional to $\|q_{0}\|_{\infty}^{2/7}$. In a similar manner, we also introduce a new cross-helicity density for the ideal non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations.</description>

      <title>A novel instability in an elastoviscoplastic fluid flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent demonstration of drastically different turbulent flow dynamics of an EVP fluid by Abdelgawad et al. (Nat. Phys., 2023, 1-5.), we analyse the linear stability of the sliding Couette flow of an EVP fluid. After yielding, the EVP fluid behaves as an Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. In the creeping-flow limit, in the absence of yield stress, two discrete linearly stable Gorodtsov and Leonov (GL) modes exist for an arbitrarily high value of the Weissenberg number. As yield stress effects, i.e., Bingham number increases, the GL modes become unstable, leading to the novel instability. Analysis reveals that these modes originate near the boundaries due to the `extra normal stress' arising from the interplay between yield stress and elasticity. The extra normal stress is an inherent feature of an EVP fluid. Thus, the predicted novel instability is expected to be present in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Collective Effects in Breath Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breath figures are the complex patterns that form when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets on a surface. The primary question concerning breath figures is how the condensing vapor is allocated between the growth of existing droplets and the nucleation of new ones. Although numerous theoretical studies have concentrated on scenarios resulting in highly polydisperse droplet ensembles, a companion paper [Bouillant {\em et al.}, submitted] demonstrates that nearly monodisperse patterns can be achieved on defect-free substrates in a diffusion-controlled regime. The objective of this work is to present a theoretical framework that elucidates the formation and evolution of nearly-monodisperse patterns in breath figures. We discover that, following a short nucleation phase, the number of droplets remains constant over an extensive range of timescales due to collective effects mediated by the diffusion of vapor. The spatial extent of these diffusive interactions is identified through asymptotic matching, based on which we provide an accurate description of breath figures through a mean-field model. The model accounts for the sub-diffusive growth of droplets as well as for the arrest of nucleating new droplets, and reveal the scaling laws for the droplet density observed in experiments. Finally, droplets expand and ultimately coalesce, which is shown to trigger a scale-free coarsening of the breath figures.</description>

      <title>FLRONet: Deep Operator Learning for High-Fidelity Fluid Flow Field Reconstruction from Sparse Sensor Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements is vital for many science and engineering applications but remains challenging because of dimensional disparities between state and observational spaces. Due to such dimensional differences, the measurement operator becomes ill-conditioned and non-invertible, making the reconstruction of flow fields from sensor measurements extremely difficult. Although sparse optimization and machine learning address the above problems to some extent, questions about their generalization and efficiency remain, particularly regarding the discretization dependence of these models. In this context, deep operator learning offers a better solution as this approach models mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, enabling superior generalization and discretization-independent reconstruction. We introduce FLRONet, a deep operator learning framework that is trained to reconstruct fluid flow fields from sparse sensor measurements. FLRONet employs a branch-trunk network architecture to represent the inverse measurement operator that maps sensor observations to the original flow field, a continuous function of both space and time. Validation performed on the CFDBench dataset has demonstrated that FLRONet consistently achieves high levels of reconstruction accuracy and robustness, even in scenarios where sensor measurements are inaccurate or missing. Furthermore, the operator learning approach endows FLRONet with the capability to perform zero-shot super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains, offering a solution for rapid reconstruction of high-fidelity flow fields.</description>

      <title>Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection: Attractors, bifurcations and heat transport via a Galerkin hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for energetically consistent climate models, the Boussinessq-Coriolis (BC) equations are studied with a focus on the averaged vertical heat transport, ie the Nusselt number. A set of formulae are derived by which arbitrary Fourier truncations of the BC model can be explicitly generated, and Criteria are given which precisely guarantee that such truncated models obey energy relations consistent with the PDE. The Howard-Krishnamurti-Coriolis (HKC) hierarchy of such energetically consistent ODE models is then implemented in MATLAB, with code available on GitHub. Several theoretical results are proven to support a numerical analysis. Well-posedness and convergence of the HKC hierarchy toward the BC model are proven, as well as the existence of an attractor for the BC model. Since the rate of convergence is unknown, explicit upper and lower bounds on the attractor dimension are proven so as to provide guidance for the required spatial resolution for an accurate approximation of the Nusselt number. Finally, a series of numerical studies are performed using MATLAB, which investigate the required spatial resolution and indicate the presence of multiple stable values of the Nusselt number, setting the stage for an energetically consistent analysis of convective heat transport.</description>

      <title>Mathematically established chaos and forecast of statistics with recurrent patterns in Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>
