      <title>A symmetric monoidal fracture square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ which is rigidly-compactly generated and a set of compact objects $\mathcal{K}$ of $\mathcal{C}$, one can form the subcategories of $\mathcal{K}$-complete and $\mathcal{K}$-local objects. The goal of this paper is to explain how to recover $\mathcal{C}$ from its $\mathcal{K}$-local and $\mathcal{K}$-complete subcategories while retaining the symmetric monoidal structure. Specializing to the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is the $\infty$-category of $G$-spectra for a finite group $G$, our result can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal variant of the isotropy separation decomposition, a version of which appeared previously in work of Krause.</description>

      <title>$C$-triviality of manifolds of low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space $X$ is said to be $C$-trivial if the total Chern class $c(\alpha)$ equals $1$ for every complex vector bundle $\alpha$ over $X$. In this note we give a complete homological classification of $C$-trivial closed smooth manifolds of dimension $&lt; 7$. In dimension $7$ we give a complete classification of orientable $C$-trivial manifolds and in the non-orientable case we give necessary homological conditions for the manifold to be $C$-trivial. Our main tool is the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence and orders of its differentials.</description>

      <title>ClusterGraph: a new tool for visualization and compression of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the global organization of complicated and high dimensional data is of primary interest for many branches of applied sciences. It is typically achieved by applying dimensionality reduction techniques mapping the considered data into lower dimensional space. This family of methods, while preserving local structures and features, often misses the global structure of the dataset. Clustering techniques are another class of methods operating on the data in the ambient space. They group together points that are similar according to a fixed similarity criteria, however unlike dimensionality reduction techniques, they do not provide information about the global organization of the data. Leveraging ideas from Topological Data Analysis, in this paper we provide an additional layer on the output of any clustering algorithm. Such data structure, ClusterGraph, provides information about the global layout of clusters, obtained from the considered clustering algorithm. Appropriate measures are provided to assess the quality and usefulness of the obtained representation. Subsequently the ClusterGraph, possibly with an appropriate structure--preserving simplification, can be visualized and used in synergy with state of the art exploratory data analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Strongly chiral rational homology spheres with hyperbolic fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $m\geq0$ and any prime $p\equiv3\ \mathrm{(mod \ 4)}$, we construct strongly chiral rational homology $(4m+3)$-spheres, which have real hyperbolic fundamental groups and only non-zero integral intermediate homology groups isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2p}$ in degrees $1,2m+1$ and $4m+1$. This gives group theoretic analogues in high dimensions of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic rational homology $3$-spheres, as well as of the existence of strongly chiral hyperbolic manifolds of any dimension that are not rational homology spheres, which was shown by Weinberger. One of our tools will be $r$-spins. We thus investigate the relationship between the sets of degrees of self-maps of a given manifold and its $r$-spins, and give classes of manifolds for which the sets are equal.</description>

      <title>Relative Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of optimal transport relative to a distinguished subset, which acts as a reservoir of mass, allowing us to compare measures of different total variation. This relative transportation problem has an optimal solution and we obtain relative versions of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, Wasserstein distance, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality and Monge-Kantorovich duality. We also prove relative versions of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani theorem, which connect the spaces of measures arising from the relative optimal transport problem to spaces of Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>Smooth Calabi-Yau structures and the noncommutative Legendre transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the relation between smooth Calabi-Yau structures and pre-Calabi-Yau structures. We show that, from a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on an $A_\infty$-category $A$, one can produce a pre-Calabi-Yau structure on $A$; as defined in our previous work, this is a shifted noncommutative version of an integrable polyvector field. We explain how this relation is an analogue of the Legendre transform, and how it defines a one-to-one mapping, in a certain homological sense. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to chains on based loop spaces of (possibly non-simply connected) Poincar\'e duality spaces, and fully calculate the case of the circle.</description>

      <title>Reflexive homology and involutive Hochschild homology as equivariant Loday constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For associative rings with anti-involution several homology theories exists, for instance reflexive homology as studied by Graves and involutive Hochschild homology defined by Fern\`andez-Val\`encia and Giansiracusa. We prove that the corresponding homology groups can be identified with the homotopy groups of an equivariant Loday construction of the one-point compactification of the sign-representation evaluated at the trivial orbit, if we assume that $2$ is invertible and if the underlying abelian group of the ring is flat. We also show a relative version where we consider an associative $k$-algebra with an anti-involution where $k$ is an arbitrary ground ring.</description>

      <title>A Persistence-Driven Edit Distance for Graphs with Abstract Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we define a novel edit distance for graphs considered with some weights on the edges. The metric is driven by the idea of considering graphs as topological summaries in the context of persistence and topological data analysis. Several examples related to persistent sets are presented. In case the graphs are trees, the metric can be computed with a dynamical binary linear programming approach. This framework is applied and further studied in other works focused on merge trees, where the problems of stability and merge trees estimation are also assessed.</description>
