      <title>RiverEcho: Real-Time Interactive Digital System for Ancient Yellow River Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yellow River is China's mother river and a cradle of human civilization. The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice queries using a large language model and a cultural knowledge dataset, delivering explanations through a talking-head digital human. Specifically, we built a knowledge database focused on the ancient Yellow River culture, including the collection of historical texts and the processing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the proposed dataset enhances the response quality of the Large Language Model(LLM), enabling the system to generate more professional and informative responses. Our work not only diversifies the means of promoting Yellow River culture but also provides users with deeper cultural insights.</description>

      <title>End-to-End RGB-IR Joint Image Compression With Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec presented at CVPR 2022.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Scissor: Token Compression with Semantic Connected Components for Video LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

      <title>Integrating Multi-Modal Sensors: A Review of Fusion Techniques for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion plays a critical role in enhancing perception for autonomous driving, overcoming individual sensor limitations, and enabling comprehensive environmental understanding. This paper first formalizes multi-sensor fusion strategies into data-level, feature-level, and decision-level categories and then provides a systematic review of deep learning-based methods corresponding to each strategy. We present key multi-modal datasets and discuss their applicability in addressing real-world challenges, particularly in adverse weather conditions and complex urban environments. Additionally, we explore emerging trends, including the integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and the role of sensor fusion in end-to-end autonomous driving, highlighting its potential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers valuable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor fusion in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Generating Attribute-Aware Human Motions from Textual Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes, enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate our model's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding with Dual-Distillation for Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements, multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized, lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness, semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning MIDI-to-Audio Alignment using a Neural Network on Piano Roll and CQT Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art MIDI-to-audio alignment.</description>

      <title>MimicMotion: High-Quality Human Motion Video Generation with Confidence-aware Pose Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects. Detailed results and comparisons are available on our project page: https://tencent.github.io/MimicMotion .</description>

      <title>FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings, character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful, narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for personalized and engaging story animation.
