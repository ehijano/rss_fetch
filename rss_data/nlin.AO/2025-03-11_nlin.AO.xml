      <title>Slow-fast systems with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the effects of instantaneous stochastic resetting on a planar slow-fast dynamical system of the form $\dot{x}=f(x)-y$ and $\dot{y}=\epsilon (x-y)$ with $0&lt;\epsilon \ll 1$. We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\gg \epsilon$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/d\tau=\E[x|y]-y$ where $\tau=\epsilon t$, $\E[x|y]=\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\E[x|y^*]$. Finally, we numerically explore deviations from averaging theory when $r=O(\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>

Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"odinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We refer to our method as cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic functions can be quantized with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is exact. Being free from any approximations, cascade quantization dispenses with simplifying assumptions such as the weakly-nonlinear limit, or semiclassical dynamics in the quantized system -- both of which have been critical in facilitating quantization in the literature. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over the existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Environmental Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small, forested catchments are prototypes of terrestrial ecosystems and have been studied in several disciplines of environmental sciences since several decades. Time series of water and matter fluxes and nutrient concentrations from these systems exhibit a bewildering diversity of spatio-temporal patterns, indicating the intricate nature of processes acting on a large range of time scales. Nonlinear dynamics is an obvious framework to investigate catchment time series. We analyze selected long-term data from three headwater catchments in the Bramke valley, Harz mountains, Lower Saxony in Germany at common biweekly resolution for the period 1991 to 2023. For every time series, we perform gap filling, detrending and removal of the annual cycle using Singular System Analysis (SSA), and then calculate metrics based on ordinal pattern statistics: the permutation entropy, permutation complexity and Fisher information, as well as their generalized versions (q-entropy and {\alpha}-entropy). Further, the position of each variable in Tarnopolski diagrams is displayed and compared to reference stochastic processes, like fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian noise, and \b{eta} noise. Still another way of distinguishing deterministic chaos and structured noise, and quantifying the latter, is provided by the complexity from ordinal pattern positioned slopes (COPPS). We also construct Horizontal Visibility Graphs and estimate the exponent of the decay of the degree distribution. Taken together, the analyses create a characterization of the dynamics of these systems which can be scrutinized for universality, either across variables or between the three geographically very close catchments.</description>
