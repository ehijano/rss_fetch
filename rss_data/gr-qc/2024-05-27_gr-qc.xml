      <title>Holographic dark energy with Granda-Oliveros cutoff and ansatz based approach: An extended look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic dark energy models have proven to be a very interesting way to study various aspects of late-time acceleration of the universe. In this work we extensively study HDE models with the Granda-Oliveros cutoff with an ansatz based approach. We consider the Tsallis, Barrow and PLEC HDE models in this regard and consdier simple power law, emergent universe, intermediate and logamediate forms of for the universe. Studying various cosmologically interesting parameters alongside the thermodynamical aspects in these models, we show that the Logamediate models are the best fit out of the other possibilites, followed by the emergent universe model, intermediate model and the simple power law models at the very last in terms of feasibility.</description>

      <title>Ringing of the Extreme Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasinormal ringing in both time and frequency domains for scalar and neutrino perturbations around black hole solutions that simultaneously describe regular and extreme configurations within a non-linear electrodynamics framework. Two types of solutions are considered: those with de Sitter and Minkowski cores. The quasinormal frequencies obtained from two independent methods exhibit excellent agreement. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression in the eikonal limit and discuss the validity of the correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and null geodesics.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Model in Einstein and Horava-Lifshitz Gravity with a new Parametrization of $\omega(z)$: Model Comparison, Analysis and Observational Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel dynamical dark energy model within the frameworks of both Einstein gravity and Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Utilizing a new parametrization of the dark energy equation of state $\omega(z)$, we derive solutions to the field equations. By employing recent cosmological datasets, such as cosmic chronometer datasets, Type Ia Supernovae datasets, Baryonic Oscillation datasets, and the recent Hubble constant value measured by the Hubble Space Telescope and the SH0ES Team as an additional prior. We validate our model and determine optimal parameter values. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of the Universe by showing the redshift dependence plots of key cosmological parameters through graphical representations. We also perform diagnostic analyses to compare our model with the standard model. Using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we compare the three models and find that all of them are supported by the current data, making it impossible to discard any of them. Our model aligns well with recent observations and unveils intriguing features of the Universe, particularly the late-time behavior of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on compact dark matter from the non-observation of gravitational-wave strong lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the non-observation of strong lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the first three observation runs of LIGO-Virgo detectors to constrain the fraction of dark matter in the form of compact objects in the mass range $10^{6}-10^{9}~{\mathrm{M}_\odot}$. Using a Bayesian formalism supplemented by astrophysical simulations of strong lensing of GWs, we constrain the compact dark matter fraction to $\lesssim 0.4-0.6$ with currently available data and show that they may get significantly tighter in the future. We find that multiple lensing -- i.e., GWs getting deflected by multiple compact objects on their way to us -- is possible. By ignoring this, we underestimate the constraints by a few percent.</description>

      <title>The estimation of parameters of generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas and viscous modified Chaplygin gas and Accretions around Black Hole in the background of Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phenomenon of accelerated cosmic expansion in the late universe and the mass accretion process of a 4-dimensional Einstein-Aether black hole. Starting with the basics of Einstein-Aether gravity theory, we have first considered the field equations and two eminent models of Chaplygin gas, viz. generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas model and viscous modified Chaplygin gas model. Then, we obtained the energy density and Hubble parameters equations for these models in terms of some dimensionless density parameters and some unknown parameters. After finding the required parameters, we proceeded with the mass accretion process. For both models, we obtained the equation of mass in terms of the redshift function and represented the change of mass of the black hole graphically with redshift. At the same time, we have made a graphical comparison between the above-mentioned models and the $\Lambda$CDM model of the universe. Eventually, we have concluded that the mass of a 4-dimensional black hole will increase along the universe's evolution in the backdrop of Einstein-Aether gravity.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Frequency Expansion for Nearly Monochromatic Binary Black Holes Detectable with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed space gravitational wave (GW) detector LISA has potential to detect stellar-mass black hole binaries (BBHs). The majority of the detected BBHs are expected to emit nearly monochromatic GWs, whose frequency evolution will be efficiently described by Taylor expansions. We study the measurability of the associated time derivative coefficients of the frequencies, by extending a recent work based on a simplified Fisher matrix analysis. Additionally, we provide qualitative discussions on how to extract astrophysical information, such as orbital eccentricity and tertiary perturbation, from the observed derivative coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lorentz group in gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is argued that in gravity theories the local Lorentz group can not be considered as a gauge group in the sense of Yang-Mills theories, the Lorentz connection is not a gauge potential but an artificial force, the inertial force. A genuine gravity theory should be a translation gauge theory, though a unnormal gauge theory. All the three theories of the Geometrical Trinity of Gravity are translation gauge theories. A real gravity theory should get rid of "gauging" Lorentz group. The covariantization of the teleparallel gravity is not necessary physically.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves in $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity without gauge fixing. The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{\mu\nu}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.</description>

      <title>Energy flux and waveform of gravitational wave generated by coalescing slow-spinning binary system in effective one-body theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our research on the energy flux and waveform characteristics of gravitational waves generated by merging nonspinning binary black holes through self-consistent effective one-body theory \cite{L2023} to include binary systems with slowly spinning black holes. Initially, we decompose the equation for the null tetrad component of the gravitationally perturbed Weyl tensor $\psi^B_{4}$ into radial and angular parts, leveraging the second-order approximation of the rotation parameter $a$. Subsequently, we derive an analytical solution for the radial equation and observe that our results are contingent upon the parameters $a_2$, $a_3$ and $a$, which represent the second- and third-order correction parameters, respectively. Ultimately, we calculate the energy flux, the radiation-reaction force and the waveform for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes of the gravitational waves generated by merging slowly spinning binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Cosmic Evolution admitting Garcia-Salcedo Ghost and Generalized Ghost Dark Energy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to explore the Garcia-Salcedo ghost dark energy and generalized ghost dark energy models in the context of $f(\mathrm{R},\mathrm{T^2})$ theory, where $\mathrm{R}$ is the Ricci scalar and $\mathrm{T^2}$ is the self-contraction of stress-energy tensor. We investigate the non-interacting case only corresponding to flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. We reconstruct the corresponding $f(\mathrm{R},\mathrm{T^2})$ gravity models using the considered dark energy models by taking two particular models of this gravity. The stability analysis is performed for all the cases. The behavior of the equation of state parameter is also checked. It is found that some of the reconstructed $f(\mathrm{R},\mathrm{T^2})$ models successfully describe both the phantom and quintessence epochs of the universe, which support the current cosmic accelerated expansion. This exploration reveals the intricate connections between dark energy models and modified gravitational theory, providing significant understanding into the dynamics of the cosmos on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Entanglement island and Page curve for one-sided charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of calculating the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation of black holes using the "in" vacuum state, which describes one-sided asymptotically flat neutral black hole formed by gravitational collapse, to dynamic charged black holes. We explore the influence of charge on the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ and the Page time. Due to their distinct geometric structures, we discuss non-extremal and extremal charged black holes separately. In non-extremal cases, the emergence of island saves the bound of entropy at late times, and the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation satisfies the Page curve. Moreover, we also find that the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ depends on the position of the cutoff surface (observers), differing from the behavior in eternal charged black holes. In extremal black holes, when the island exists, the entanglement entropy is approximately equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, while the entanglement entropy becomes ill-defined when island is absent. Our analysis underscores how different geometric configurations significantly influence the behavior of entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While two highly intensive laser beams collide, they create a region where the refractive index varies so quickly that photons are created. The variance of the refractive index is analog to the universe scale factor variance. Therefore, this laser system can be an analog to the expansion of the universe. We find that several hundreds of photons can be created under feasible conditions. This system can demonstrate the particle creation during inflation or other similar periods.</description>

Abstract: If the Universe is closed, there must exist a constant and positive energy density of vacuum (cosmological constant). By analyzing the McVittie metric, we show that in the expanding Universe: the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes are equal and related to the cosmological constant, black holes do not grow with the expansion of the Universe, and different regions of the Universe expand at different rates (Hubble tension).</description>

      <title>Geometrically Thick Disks around Kerr Black Holes in a Swirling Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate geometrically thick disks around Kerr black holes in a swirling universe. This stationary and axisymmetric spacetime is composed of a Kerr black hole, which is immersed in a swirling background. The swirling background is characterized by an odd $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, where the northern and southern hemispheres are rotating in opposite directions. The Kerr and swirling rotations can lead to the emergence of complex spin-spin interactions, which heavily influence the spacetime properties. In order to study this influence, we analyze prograde as well as retrograde circular orbits and geometrically thick disks for different spacetime solutions, which are classified by their Kerr parameter $a$ and the swirling parameter $j$. We find stabilizing effects on prograde circular orbits and destabilizing effects on retrograde circular orbits, which originate from the spin-spin interaction and depend mainly on the Kerr rotation. Furthermore, the background rotation leads to an emergence of static orbits and the symmetry breaking regarding the equatorial plane causes a vertical distribution of the circular orbits and thick torus solutions. Due to the destabilizing effect of the swirling rotation, an outer marginally stable orbit appears, which heavily downsizes the parameter space for disk solutions. Dependent on the Keplerian specific angular momentum distribution of the spacetime and on the disk momentum $\ell_0$, different types of disk are possible which we classify and which differ in terms of the complex disk dynamics that could arise due to the presence of an inner and outer cusp or just an outer cusp.</description>

      <title>Barrow entropy and spacetime foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravitational effects, on the one hand, lead to a limitation in the accuracy of measuring spatial and time intervals, and, on the other hand, they generate a discrete of spacetime structure (quantum foam). The common source of both measurement limitations and discreteness of space-time are quantum fluctuations, so their characteristics must be related to each other. We study such a relationship using Barrow entropy as a source of fractal space-time structure. The minimum inaccuracy in measuring space-time intervals is expressed through the Barrow entropy parameter. The connection between the level of fractality and the speed of information processing is considered.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, the energy extraction conditions, the power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive for energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave equations for some curved spacetimes may involve functions that prevent a solution in a closed form. In some cases, these functions can be eliminated by transformations and the solutions can be found analytically. In the cases where such transformations are not available, the infinite series expansions of these functions can be convoluted with the power series solution ansatz. We study such an example where the solution is based on a special function.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Cosmology: Be Careful of the Black Hole Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) offer insights into the universe expansion. The spectral siren method, used without electromagnetic counterparts (EMC), infers cosmic expansion (Hubble constant) by relating detector and source frame masses of black hole (BH) mergers. However, heuristic mass models (broken power law, power law plus peak, multipeak) may introduce biases in the Hubble constant estimation, potentially up to 3 sigma with 2000 detected GW mergers. These biases stem from the models inability to consider redshift evolution and unexpected mass features. Future GW cosmology studies should employ adaptable source mass models to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Statistical conformal Killing Vector Fields for FLRW Space-Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of conformal Killing vector fields for FLRW space-time from Riemannian point of view was done by Maartens-Maharaj in \cite{Maartens1986}. In this paper, we introduce conformal Killing vector fields from a new point of view for the FLRW space-time. In particular, we consider three cases for the conformal factor. Then, it is shown that there exist nine conformal vector fields on FLRW in total, such that six of them are Killing and the rest being non-Killing conformal vector fields. Consequently, by recalling the concept of statistical conformal Killing vector fields introduced in \cite{SP}, we classify statistical structures with repsect to which these vector fields are conformal Killing. We also obtain the form of affine connections that feature a vanishing Lie derivative with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields. Imposing the torsion-free and the Codazzi conditions on these connections, we study statistical structures on FLRW. Finally, for torsionful connections we study the vanishing of the Lie derivative of the torsion tensor with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields and derive the conditions under which this is valid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Hubble parameterization method and employ observational data from Hubble, Pantheon, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constrain model parameters. The proposed method is thoroughly validated against these datasets, demonstrating a robust fit to the observational Hubble, Pantheon, and BAO data. The obtained best-fit values are $H_0 = 67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ $\text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm{m0}} = 0.2764\pm{0.0094}$, and $\alpha = 0.33\pm{0.22}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results, highlighting the existence of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A waveform model for the missing quadrupole mode from black hole coalescence: memory effect and ringdown of the $(\ell=2,m=0)$ spherical harmonic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a model for the $(\ell=2, m=0)$ spherical harmonic mode of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the coalescence of binary black holes, in particular, spin-aligned systems. This mode can be viewed as consisting of two components, gravitational wave memory and quasi-normal ringdown, which are both included in our model. Depending on the parameters of the binary and the sensitivity curve of the detector, but in particular for high masses, the ringdown part can contribute significantly to the signal-to-noise ratio. The model is constructed using the methods of the phenomenological waveforms program, and is calibrated to public numerical relativity data from the SXS waveforms catalog, with the analytical results derived from the BMS balance laws. The code has been implemented as an extension to the computationally efficient IMRPhenomTHM model, it can therefore be used for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian parameter estimation. The region of validity of our model in the parameter space is given by: $q\leq10$ and $\chi_{1},\chi_{2}\in[-1,1]$, and no restrictions apply in terms of the length of the waveforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will explore the effects of non-commutativity in fractional classical and quantum schemes using the anisotropicc Bianchi Type I cosmological model coupled to a scalar field in the K-essence formalism. We introduce non-commutative variables considering that all minisuperspace variables $q^i_{nc}$ do not commute, so the symplectic structure was modified, resulting in some changes with respect to the traditional formalism. In the quantum regime, the probability density presents a new structure in the scalar field corresponding to the value of the non-commutative parameter.</description>

      <title>A new search pipeline for gravitational waves with higher-order modes using mode-by-mode filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all template-based gravitational wave (GW) searches only include the quasi-circular quadrupolar modes of the signals in their templates. Including additional degrees of freedom in the GW templates corresponding to higher-order harmonics, orbital precession, or eccentricity is challenging because: ($i$) the size of template banks and the matched-filtering cost increases significantly with the number of degrees of freedom, $(ii)$ if these additional degrees are not included properly, the search can lose sensitivity overall (due to an increase in the rate of background triggers). Here, we focus on including aligned-spin higher harmonics in GW search templates. We use a new mode-by-mode filtering approach, where we separately filter GW strain data with three harmonics [namely $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$, $(3,3)$ and $(4,4)$]. This results in an increase in the matched-filtering cost by only a factor of $3$ compared to that of a $(2,2)$-only search. We develop computationally cheap trigger-ranking statistics to optimally combine the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) timeseries from different harmonics, which ensure only physically-allowed combinations of the different harmonics are triggered on. We use an empirical template-dependent background model in our ranking statistic to account for non-Gaussian transients. In addition, we develop a tool called band eraser which specifically excises narrow time-varying noisy bands in time-frequency space (without having to excise entire time chunks in the data). New GW candidate events that we detect using our search pipeline and the details of our template banks are discussed in accompanying papers: Wadekar et al. [1] and [2] respectively. Apart from higher harmonics, we expect our methodology to also be useful for cheap and optimal searches including orbital precession and eccentricity in GW waveforms.</description>

      <title>Closed FRW holography: A time-dependent ER=EPR realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20652v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent de Sitter holographic proposal and entanglement entropy prescription to generic closed FRW cosmologies in arbitrary dimensions, and propose that for large classes of bouncing and Big Bang/Big Crunch cosmologies, the full spacetime can be encoded holographically on two holographic screens, associated to two antipodal observers. In the expanding phase, the two screens lie at the apparent horizons. In the contracting phase, there is an infinite number of possible trajectories of the holographic screens, which can be grouped in equivalence classes. In each class the effective holographic theory can be derived from a pair of ``parent'' screens on the apparent horizons. A number of cases including moduli dominated cosmologies escape our discussion, and it is expected that two antipodal observers and their associated screens do not suffice to reconstruct these cosmologies. The leading contributions to the entanglement entropy between the screens arise from a minimal extremal trapped or anti-trapped surface lying in the region between them. This picture entails a time-dependent realization of the ER=EPR conjecture, where an effective geometrical bridge connecting the screens via the minimal extremal surface emerges from entanglement. For the Big Crunch contracting cases, the screens disentangle and the geometrical bridge closes off when the minimal extremal trapped sphere hits the Big Crunch singularity at a finite time before the collapse of the Universe. Semiclassical, thermal corrections are incorporated in the cases of radiation dominated cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discussions of the arrow of time often get quite confusing due to highly complex systems they deal with. Popular literature then often coveys messages that tend to get lost in translation. The purpose of this note is to demystify the arrow of time by stripping off the unnecessary complexities and thereby simplifying the discussion. We do this by providing examples that are exactly solvable and make it easy to see the root cause of the apparent "time-irreversibility". We also discuss "time-reversal" solutions, where the initial state evolves such that it reaches the state which is the same as the initial state moving backward in time. These solutions are simple enough to be comprehensible to a highschooler. We discuss the arrow of time both in the classical and quantum settings, including in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Complementarity for a Dynamical Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole complementarity posits that the interior of a black hole is not independent from its Hawking radiation. This leads to an apparent violation of causality: the interior can be acausally affected by operators acting solely on the radiation. We argue that this perspective is misleading and that the black hole interior must be viewed as existing in the causal past of the Hawking radiation, despite the fact that they are spacelike separated in the semiclassical description. Consequently, no operation on the Hawking radiation -- no matter how complex -- can affect the experience of an infalling observer. The black hole interior and the radiation only appear spacelike separated in the semiclassical description because an infalling observer's ability to access complex information is limited; the chaotic dynamics on the horizon, as viewed from the exterior, then converts any effect caused by such an observer to information in the Hawking radiation which cannot be accessed at the semiclassical level. We arrive at the picture described above by considering a unitary exterior description in which the flow of information is strictly causal, which we extend to apply throughout the entire history of black hole evolution, including its formation. This description uses the stretched event horizon as an inner edge of spacetime, on which the information inside is holographically encoded. We argue that the global spacetime picture arises from coarse-graining over black hole microstates, and discuss its relationship with the exterior description.</description>

      <title>Dual Inflation and Bounce Cosmologies Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the entire parameter space of a dual scenario that combines generalized inflation and bounce cosmologies. In this scenario, the redshift term of curvature perturbation are phenomenologically generalized to accommodate various model-building of inflation and bounce cosmologies. Performing a Bayesian analysis with data from NANOGrav 15-year, PPTA DR3, EPTA DR2, and IPTA DR2, we identify, for the first time, two groups of regions -- each comprising dual regions from inflation and bounce -- that can simultaneously explain stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals detected by pulsar timing arrays and produce scale-invariant curvature perturbations compatible with observations of CMB anisotropies. Bayes factor (BF) calculations indicate that this dual scenario is strongly favored by NG15 data with large BFs over other conventional astrophysical and cosmological sources, such as supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, domain walls, first-order phase transitions, and scalar-induced gravitational waves. Our Bayesian analysis also provides initial evidence of a duality between inflation and bounce cosmologies regarding SGWB. These results offer new insights for model-building in the early universe's inflation or bounce phases and highlight parameter regions that can be probed by current and future CMB observations and gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Taub-NUT Instanton as the Self-dual Analog of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that a certain vacuum Kerr-Schild spacetime, which may be regarded as a self-dual analog of the Kerr metric, is equivalent to the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton. We confirm this conjecture by applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to each metric and showing that for suitable choices of null tetrad, the algorithm leads to the same invariants and linear isotropy groups for both, establishing their equivalence. While it is well-known that the Taub-NUT solution and its self-dual version admit a double Kerr-Schild form, the observation that the self-dual Taub-NUT instanton admits a single Kerr-Schild form has only been made very recently. The two metrics we compare may be regarded as either complex metrics with Lorentzian (1,3) signature or real metrics with Kleinian (2,2) signature; here we take the latter view. Significant simplifications occur when the null tetrads are chosen to consist of two pairs of complex conjugate null vectors rather than four real independent ones. As a bonus, our work provides the first example of applying the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm using a null tetrad of this type.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology: large-temperature behaviour and bounds from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a transparent discussion of the high temperature asymptotic behaviour of Cosmology in a dilaton-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (dEGB) scenario of modified gravity with vanishing scalar potential. In particular, we show that it has a clear interpretation in terms of only three attractors (stable critical points) of a set of autonomous differential equations: $w=-\frac{1}{3}$, $w=1$ and $1&lt;w&lt;\frac{7}{3}$, where $w\equiv p/\rho$ is the equation of state, defined as the ratio of the total pressure and the total energy density. All the possible different high-temperature evolution histories of the model are exhausted by only eight paths in the flow of the set of the autonomous differential equations. Our discussion clearly explains why five out of them are characterized by a swift transition of the system toward the attractor, while the remaining three show a more convoluted evolution, where the system follows a meta-stable equation of state at intermediate temperatures before eventually jumping to the real attractor at higher temperatures. Compared to standard Cosmology, the regions of the dEGB parameter space with $w=-\frac{1}{3}$ show a strong enhancement of the expected Gravitational Wave stochastic background produced by the primordial plasma of relativistic particles of the Standard Model. This is due to the very peculiar fact that dEGB allows to have an epoch when the energy density $\rho_{\rm rad}$ of the relativistic plasma dominates the energy of the Universe while at the same time the rate of dilution with $T$ of the total energy density is slower than what usually expected during radiation dominance. This allows to use the bound from BBN to put in dEGB a constraint $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^8 - 10^9$ GeV on the reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm RH}$. Such BBN bound is complementary to late-time constraints from compact binary mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that certain aspects of the measurement require revision in Quantum Gravity. Using entropic arguments, we propose that the number of measurement outcomes and the accuracy (or the range) of the measurement are limited by the entropy of the black hole associated with the observer scale. This also implies the necessity of modifying the algebra of commutation relationships to ensure a finite representation of observables, changing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing the strong nuclear force and the interactions among quarks and gluons. Topological stars, characterized by extreme density conditions, offer a unique environment where QCD phenomena play a crucial role due to the confinement of fundamental particles. Understanding these phenomena is essential for unraveling the behavior and properties of these celestial bodies.
  In this study, we explore the implications of QCD within extreme density regimes, focusing on its contribution to the energy-momentum tensor ($T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{QCD}}$) within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics. Our analysis sheds light on how these QCD effects influence the fabric of spacetime in the vicinity of topological stars, providing valuable insights into their underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q$-form field on squared curvature gravity domain wall brane coupling with gravity and background scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a $q$-form field, represented as $\displaystyle X_{M_1M_2...M_q}$, where $\displaystyle q$ indicates the number of indices, with special cases $\displaystyle q = 0, 1, 2$ corresponding to the scalar fields, vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields, respectively. Unlike the duality observed between scalar and vector fields in four-dimensional spacetime, $q$-form fields in higher dimensions correspond to a wider array of particles. We propose a novel localized Kaluza-Klein decomposition approach for the $q$-form field in a five-dimensional spacetime, considering its coupling with gravity and background scalar fields. This methodology enables the successful localization of the $q$-form field on a domain wall brane, leading to the derivation of zero modes, Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, and a four-dimensional effective action. Additionally, in order to stand for the coupling of the $q$-form field with gravity and scalar fields of the background spacetime, we propose a new coupling function $F(R,\varphi)$. Our analysis highlights the significance of the parameters $\displaystyle C_2$ and $\displaystyle t$ in the localization process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $\Phi$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $\Phi$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux ($\Phi^{\rm cri}$) that admits shocks in GRMHD flow and ascertain that $\Phi^{\rm cri}$ is higher (lower) for black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$ ($0.0$) and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Cross-Matching of OGLE, GAIA, and Hubble Catalogs: Evaluating the Probability of Resolving Lens Stars in Microlensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study commenced by cross-matching data from the GAIA and OGLE telescopes with the aim of resolving the source star, long after microlensing is finished. The aim is breaking degeneracy between parameters of the microlensing equation, and ultimately calculating the mass of lens. We have examined different catalogs and found no evidence. Subsequently, employing the Monte Carlo method and guided by sensible assumptions, we embarked a simulation to discern the distribution of angular separation and to probe the feasibility of detecting this phenomenon. The results revealed that a mere 0.029% of gravitational microlensing events exhibited separations exceeding 50 milliarcseconds. Consequently, the likelihood of observing this phenomenon utilizing the OGLE and GAIA telescopes appears exceedingly far available. However, it is worth noting that instruments with very high angular resolution in the range of several tens of milliarcseconds present a viable avenue for such observations. Finally, we proposed 60 microlensing events for which the observation of separation is more probable based on the measured proper velocity.</description>

      <title>Doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang models, Born-selfdual $\kappa$-deformed quantum phase spaces and two generalizations of Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that by using two different realizations of $\hat{o}(1,4)$ Lie algebra one can describe one-parameter standard Snyder model and two-parameter $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model. In this paper, by using the generalized Born duality and Jacobi identities we obtain from the $\kappa$-deformed Snyder model the doubly $\kappa$-deformed Yang model which provides the new class of quantum relativistic phase spaces. These phase spaces contain as subalgebras the $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space-time as well as quantum $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformed fourmomenta and are depending on five independent parameters. Such a large class of quantum phase spaces can be described in $D=4$ by particular realizations of $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebra, what illustrates the property that in noncommutative geometry different $D=4$ physical models may be described by various realizations of the same algebraic structure. Finally, in the last Section we propose two new ways of generalizing Yang models: by introducing $\hat o(1,3+2N)$ algebras ($N=1,2\ldots$) we provide internal symmetries $O(N)$ symmetries in Kaluza-Klein extended Yang model, and by replacing the classical $\hat{o}(1,5)$ algebras which describe the algebraic structure of Yang models by $\hat o(1,5)$ quantum groups with suitably chosen nonprimitive coproducts.</description>

      <title>Bounding Dark Energy from the SPARC rotation curves: Data driven probe for galaxy virialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy (DE) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper bound on DE studies its resistance to the attractive gravitational force from dark matter. Using the SPARC dataset, we fit the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist models to identify the most suitable galaxies for these models. Introducing the presence of DE in these galaxies helps establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper bound on DE sits around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. We discuss the conditions for detecting DE in different systems and show the consistency of the upper bound from galaxies to other systems. The upper bound is of the same order of magnitude as $\rho_{200} = 200 \rho_c$ for both dark matter profiles. We also address the implications for future measurements on that upper bound and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in presence of isometries and non-trivial topology, the Einstein--Hilbert action is invariant under certain transformations of the metric which are not diffeomorphisms. These transformations are similar to the higher-form symmetries of field theories with $p$-form fields. In the context of toroidal Kaluza--Klein compactifications, we show that these symmetries give rise to some of the ``hidden symmetries'' (dualities) of the dimensionally-reduced theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although we lack complete understanding of quantum aspects of gravitation, it is usually agreed, using general arguments, that a final quantum gravity theory will endow space and time with some (fundamental or effective) notion of discreteness. This granular character is supposed to lie on space and time scales of $l_P \sim 10^{-33}$ cm and $\tau_P\sim 10^{-42}$ s, respectively -- the Planck scale -- , far beyond any hope of direct assessment. Here, by modeling displacements of particles on a discrete underlying space as Poisson processes, we speculate on the possibility of amplifying the effects of space discreteness (if existent) by several orders of magnitude, using the statistical variance of correlated displacements of particles/systems with very different masses. Although still out of reach by current technology, the analysis presented here suggests that it may be possible to see hints of space(time) discreteness at larger scales than one would usually expect.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of false vacuum decay in arbitrary dimensions, in the presence of gravity, and compute the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation, generalising the results of Coleman and de Luccia. In the particular case of one compact dimension, we present explicit formulae for the Euclidean Bounce configuration that drives the transition from a de Sitter to Minkowski or from a Minkowski to anti-de Sitter vacua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the (ambi-)twistor model for spinning particles interacting via electromagnetic field, as a toy model for studying classical dynamics of gravitating bodies including effects of both spins to all orders. We compute the momentum kick and spin kick up to one-loop order and show precisely how they are encoded in the classical eikonal. The all-orders-in-spin effects are encoded as a dynamical implementation of the Newman-Janis shift, and we find that the expansion in both spins can be resummed to simple expressions in special kinematic configurations, at least up to one-loop order. We confirm that the classical eikonal can be understood as the generator of canonical transformations that map the in-states of a scattering process to the out-states. We also show that cut contributions for converting worldline propagators from time-symmetric to retarded amount to the iterated action of the leading eikonal at one-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

Abstract: We use the loop-by-loop Baikov representation to investigate the geometries in Feynman integrals contributing to the classical dynamics of a black-hole two-body system in the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity. These geometries determine the spaces of functions to which the corresponding Feynman diagrams evaluate. As a proof of principle, we provide a full classification of the geometries appearing up to three loops, i.e. fourth post-Minkowskian order, for all diagrams relevant to the conservative as well as the dissipative dynamics, finding full agreement with the literature. Moreover, we show that the non-planar top topology at four loops, which is the most complicated sector with respect to integration-byparts identities, has an algebraic leading singularity and thus can only depend on non-trivial geometries through its subsectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring hidden priors when interpreting gravitational wave and electromagnetic probes of the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide range of sub- and super-nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them ideal probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation and in highly dynamic events, many recent observations, most famously the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals associated with the BNS merger GW170817/AT2017gfo, have provided suggestive insight into these highest nuclear densities. Measurements of galactic neutron star masses and radii from NICER and other radio and X-ray measurements provide critical complementary perspectives, bounding other features of the EoS. Though nominally congruent, in this paper we highlight many underappreciated "hidden" priors embedded in joint analysis of these many messengers, and their systematic impact on joint EoS inference. In this work, we perform a careful step-by-step Bayesian inference using a simple low-dimensional parametric EoS model, incrementally adding information from galactic pulsars, gravitational wave sources, and more speculative constraints involving kilonovae and the neutron star maximum mass. At each stage, we carefully discuss the marginal likelihood, explaining how hidden priors impact conclusions. Conversely, we also quantify how much information these measurements have, arguing that many if not most have minimal impact relative to the explicit and hidden prior assumptions. Specifically, we find two features dominate our inference: on the one hand, the choice of EoS parameterization and particularly hyperprior, and on the other the astrophysical priors associated with interpreting events, particularly the multimessenger source GW170817. In an appendix, we outline a simple semianalytic projection suitable for assessing the measurability of the EoS with ensembles of present and future detections.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint on axion non-Abelian dynamics during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary models equipped with Chern-Simons coupling between their axion and gauge sectors exhibit an array of interesting signals including a testable chiral gravitational wave spectrum. The energy injection in the gauge sector triggered by the rolling axion leads to a well-studied enhancement of gauge field fluctuations. These may in turn affect observables such as the scalar and tensor spectra and also account for non-linear corrections to field propagators. In this work, we focus on non-Abelian gauge sectors. We show that gauge field self-interactions and axion-gauge field non-linear couplings significantly renormalize the gauge field mode function. Operating within the regime of validity of the perturbative treatment places strong constraints on the accessible parameter space of this class of models. We calculate corrections to the gauge field propagator that are universally present in these scenarios. Enforcing perturbativity on such propagators leads to bounds that are competitive with those stemming from analytical estimates on the onset of the strong backreaction regime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the radiative processes involving two entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors that are moving on circular trajectories in $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We assume that the detectors are coupled to a massless, quantum scalar field, and calculate the transition probability rates of the detectors in the Minkowski vacuum as well as in a thermal bath. We also evaluate the transition probability rates of the detectors when they are switched on for a finite time interval with the aid of a Gaussian switching function. We begin by examining the response of a single detector before we go on to consider the case of two entangled detectors. As we shall see, working in $(2+1)$ spacetime dimensions makes the computations of the transition probability rates of the detectors relatively simpler. We find that the cross transition probability rates of the two entangled detectors can be comparable to the auto transition probability rates of the individual detectors. We discuss specific characteristics of the response of the entangled detectors for different values of the parameters involved and highlight the effects of the thermal bath as well as switching on the detector for a finite time interval.</description>

Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is a hypothesized modification of Newton's law of universal gravitation to account for the flat rotation curves in the outer regions of galaxies, thereby eliminating the need for dark matter. Although a highly successful model, it is not a self-contained physical theory since it is based entirely on observations. It is proposed in this paper that noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, can account for the flat rotation curves and thereby provide a justification for MOND. This paper extends an earlier heuristic argument by the author.</description>

Abstract: We analyse several aspects of detectors with uniform acceleration $a$ and uniform rotation $\Omega$ in de Sitter ($\Lambda&gt;0$) and anti-de Sitter ($\Lambda&lt;0$) spacetimes, focusing particularly on the periodicity, in (Euclidean) proper time $\tau_{\rm traj}$, of geodesic interval $\tau_{\rm geod}$ between two events on the trajectory. For $\Lambda&lt;0$, $\tau_{\rm geod}$ is periodic in ${\rm i} \tau_{\rm traj}$ for specific values of $a$ and $\Omega$. These results are used to obtain numerical plots for the response rate $\dot{\mathcal{F}}$ of Unruh-de Witt detectors, which display non-trivial combined effects of rotation and curvature through the dimensionless parameter $\Lambda c^2/\Omega^2$. In particular, periodicity does not imply thermality due to additional poles in the Wightman function away from the imaginary axis. We then present some results for stationary rotational motion in arbitrary curved spacetime, as a perturbative expansion in curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonminimally coupled theories where a scalar field is coupled to the Ricci scalar, neutron stars (NSs) can have scalar charges through an interaction with matter mediated by gravity. On the other hand, the same theories do not give rise to hairy black hole (BH) solutions. The observations of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from an inspiralling NS-BH binary system allows a possibility of constraining the NS scalar charge. Moreover, the nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories generate a breathing scalar mode besides two tensor polarizations. Using the GW200115 data of the coalescence of a BH-NS binary, we place observational constraints on the NS scalar charge as well as the nonminimal coupling strength for a subclass of massless Horndeski theories with a luminal GW propagation. Unlike past related works, we exploit a waveform for a mixture of tensor and scalar polarizations. Taking the breathing mode into account, the scalar charge is more tightly constrained in comparison to the analysis of the tensor GWs alone. In nonminimally coupled theories including Brans-Dicke gravity and spontaneous scalarization scenarios with/without a kinetic screening, we put new bounds on model parameters of each theory.</description>

      <title>Multipole expansion at the level of the action in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the multipole expansion of the long-wavelength effective action for radiative sources in ($d$+1) spacetime dimensions. We present detailed expressions for the multipole moments for the case of scalar-, electromagnetic-, and (linearized) gravitational-wave emission. For electromagnetism and gravity, we derive expressions for the odd-parity, magnetic-type moments as SO($d$) duals of the ones traditionally used in the literature. The $d$-dimensional case features a novel set of `Weyl-type' moments, coupling to the spatial part of the Weyl tensor, which are absent in three dimensions. Agreement is found in the overlap with previous known results, notably in the $d \to 3$ limit. Due to its reliance on dimensional regularization, the results presented here play a crucial role for the further development of the Effective Field Theory approach to gravitational dynamics, and in particular for the computation of the gravitational-wave flux, starting at the third post-Newtonian order.</description>

Abstract: We consider antisymmetric Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity with a Lagrangian containing the most general terms up to dimension four and search for theories that are ghost- and tachyon-free when expanded around flat space. We find new examples that propagate only the graviton and one other massive degree of freedom of spin zero, one or two. These models require terms of the form $(\nabla T)^2$ in the Lagrangian, that have been largely ignored in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational lensing of supermassive black holes surrounded by dark matter halo has attracted a great number of interests in recent years. However, many studies employed simplified dark matter density models, which makes it very hard to give a precise prediction on the dark matter effects in real astrophysical galaxies. In this work, to more accurately describe the distribution of dark matter in real astrophysical galaxies, we study the gravitational lensing of black holes in astrophysical dark matter halo models (Beta, Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore). The deflection angle is obtained using a generalized Gibbons-Werner approach. The visual angular positions and the Einstein rings are also calculated by adopting the gravitational lens equation. Specifically, we choose the supermassive black holes in Milky Way Galaxy, Andromeda galaxy (M31), Virgo galaxy (M87), and ESO138-G014 galaxy as examples, including the corresponding fitted value of dark matter halos. The results suggest that the dark matter halo described by the Beta model has non-negligible influences on the gravitational deflection angle and gravitational lensing observations. However, the Burkert, Brownstein, and Moore models have relatively small influences on angular position of images and the Einstein ring.</description>

Abstract: We study radial perturbations of spherically symmetric spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosonic stars, computing numerically the squared frequency of the fundamental mode. We find that not all critical points $-$ where the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass attains an extremum $-$ correspond to zero modes. Thus, radial stability does not $\textit{always}$ change at such critical points. The results are in agreement with the so-called critical point method.</description>

      <title>Conformal Killing cosmology -- Geometry, dark sector, growth of structures, and big rip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Sinyukov-like tensors, a special kind of conformal Killing tensors. In Robertson-Walker space-times they have the perfect-fluid form and only depend on two constants and the scale factor. They are the candidate for the dark term of the newly proposed Conformal Killing Gravity, by Harada. In addition to ordinary matter, the Friedmann equations contain a dark term and a Lambda term that parametrize the Sinyukov-like tensor. The expression of H(z) is tested on cosmological data based on cosmic chronometers CC or including baryon acoustic oscillations BAO. There is a large incertitude in Omega_Lambda and Omega_dark that may become negative, but their sum is close to Omega_Lambda of Lambda-CDM. In any case, there is a future singularity, that is a big rip for all Omegas positive. We solve the equation for the evolution, in linear approximation, of the density contrast in matter-dominated universe. The dark sector and the Lambda term give no significative deviation from Lambda-CDM and GR results.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the reheating phase after Higgs inflation in the hybrid metric-Palatini approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the post-inflationary era called reheating stage. For this purpose, we consider a model in which the inflaton is non-minimally coupled to the curvature within the hybrid metric-Palatini approach. Furthermore, to investigate the consistency of our results with the observational data, we relate reheating parameters to those of inflation model. By taking into consideration the Higgs potential $V(\phi)=\lambda/4 \phi^4$; we derive the necessary quantities needed to obtain the reheating duration and the reheating temperature. Moreover, we plot reheating e-folds and temperature as a function of the spectral index, respectively. We consider three cases depending on the coupling constant $\xi$. In addition, we use some specific values of the effective equation of state $\omega$, which is presumed to remain relatively constant within the range of $-\frac{1}{3} \leq \omega &lt; \frac{1}{3}$. We find that for $\xi=10^{-4.1}$ our results are in agreement with the recent Planck data as the reheating instant is corresponding to the central value of the spectral index and to a maximum temperature required by the scale of baryogenesis models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, combined with small inaccuracies in the estimated masses of larger asteroids, introduces timing noise for pulsars equivalent to a strain amplitude of ~10^{-15}, which cannot be neglected relative to the reported signal. The asteroid contribution needs to be modeled better in order to obtain accurate inferences from the PTA signal.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss the effect of light, non-gauge, bosonic degrees of freedom on the exterior spacetime of an exotic compact object. We show that such fields generically introduce large deviations from black hole spacetimes of General Relativity near and outside the surfaces of ultra-compact exotic objects unless one assumes they totally decouple from the standard model or new heavy fields. Hence, using black hole spacetimes of General Relativity to model ultra-compact exotic objects and their perturbations relies implicitly on this assumption or on the absence of such fields.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear studies of modifications to general relativity: Comparing different approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the dynamical, nonlinear regime of modified theories of gravity remains a theoretical challenge that limits our ability to test general relativity. Here we consider two generally applicable, but approximate methods for treating modifications to full general relativity that have been used to study binary black hole mergers and other phenomena in this regime, and compare solutions obtained by them to those from solving the full equations of motion. The first method evolves corrections to general relativity order by order in a perturbative expansion, while the second method introduces extra dynamical fields in such a way that strong hyperbolicity is recovered. We use shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a benchmark theory to illustrate the differences between these methods for several spacetimes of physical interest. We study the formation of scalar hair about initially non-spinning black holes, the collision of black holes with scalar charge, and the inspiral and merger of binary black holes. By directly comparing predictions, we assess the extent to which those from the approximate treatments can be meaningfully confronted with gravitational wave observations. We find that the order-by-order approach cannot faithfully track the solutions when the corrections to general relativity are non-negligible. The second approach, however, can provide consistent solutions, provided the ad-hoc timescale over which the dynamical fields are driven to their target values is made short compared to the physical timescales.</description>

      <title>Natural dynamical reduction of the three-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem is a fundamental long-standing open problem, with applications in all branches of physics, including astrophysics, nuclear physics and particle physics. In general, conserved quantities allow to reduce the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions. This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities. Applications to global features, to the statistical solution and to special exact solutions are presented. A generalization to the four-body problem is presented.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Model of Quantum Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum model of the Schwarzschild black hole as a quantum mechanics of a system of fermionic degrees of freedom. The system has a constant density of states and a Fermi energy that is inversely proportional to the size of the system. Assuming equivalence principle, we show that the degeneracy pressure of the Fermi degrees of freedom is able to withstand the collapse of gravity if the radius of the system is given precisely by the horizon radius of the Schwarzschild black hole. In our model, the fermionic degrees of freedom at each energy level can be entangled in certain different ways, giving rise to a multitude of degenerate ground states of the system. The counting of these microstates reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This simple Fermi model is universal and works also for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om charged black hole as well as black hole with a cosmological constant. From the properties of the Fermi variables, we propose that quantum gravity is characterized by a principle of {\it maximal capacity of states} where there can be no more than $V /l_P^3$ quantum states in any volume $V$. It implies a loss of spatial locality below the Planck length and suggests that any singularity predicted by general relativity is resolved and replaced by a quantum space in quantum gravity. In our model, a black hole spacetime is equipped with an uniform distribution of energy levels. This is another reason why black hole can be considered a simple harmonic oscillator of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formalism to solve the kinematical constraints due to Weyl invariance for CFTs in curved backgrounds and/or non-trivial states, and we apply it to thermal CFTs and to CFTs on squashed spheres. The ambient space formalism is based on constructing a class of geometric objects that are Weyl covariant and identifying them as natural building blocks of correlation functions. We construct (scalar) $n$-point functions and we illustrate the formalism with a detailed computation of 2-point functions. We compare our results for thermal 2-point functions with results that follow from thermal OPEs and holographic computations, finding exact agreement. In our holographic computation we also obtain the OPE coefficient of the leading double-twist contribution, and we discuss how the double-twist coefficients may be computed from the multi-energy-momentum contributions, given knowledge of the analytic structure of the correlator. The 2-point function for the CFT on squashed spheres is a new result. We also discuss the relation of our work to flat holography.</description>

Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Hotspots and Photon Rings in Spherically-Symmetric Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future black hole (BH) imaging observations are expected to resolve finer features corresponding to higher-order images of hotspots and of the horizon-scale accretion flow. In spherical spacetimes, the image order is determined by the number of half-loops executed by the photons that form it. Consecutive-order images arrive approximately after a delay time of $\approx\pi$ times the BH shadow radius. The fractional diameters, widths, and flux-densities of consecutive-order images are exponentially demagnified by the lensing Lyapunov exponent, a characteristic of the spacetime. The appearance of a simple point-sized hotspot when located at fixed spatial locations or in motion on circular orbits is investigated. The exact time delay between the appearance of its zeroth and first-order images agrees with our analytic estimate, which accounts for the observer inclination, with $\lesssim 20\%$ error for hotspots located about $\lesssim 5M$ from a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$. Since M87$^\star$ and Sgr A$^\star$ host geometrically-thick accretion flows, we also explore the variation in the diameters and widths of their first-order images with disk scale-height. Using a simple conical torus model, for realistic morphologies, we estimate the first-order image diameter to deviate from that of the shadow by $\lesssim 30\%$ and its width to be $\lesssim 1.3M$. Finally, the error in recovering the Schwarzschild lensing exponent ($\pi$), when using the diameters or the widths of the first and second-order images is estimated to be $\lesssim 20\%$. It will soon become possible to robustly learn more about the spacetime geometry of astrophysical BHs from such measurements.</description>

Abstract: General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory provides a covariant formalism for out-of-equilibrium phenomena in GR, extending the Einstein equations with an entropic force that behaves like bulk viscosity with a negative effective pressure. In particular, the growth of entropy associated with the homogeneous causal horizon can explain the present acceleration of the Universe, without introducing a cosmological constant. The dynamics of the accelerated Universe is characterized by a single parameter $\alpha$, the ratio of the causal horizon to the curvature scale, which provides a unique history of the Universe distinguishable from that of LCDM. In particular, we explain the coincidence problem and the Hubble tension by shifting the coasting point to higher redshifts. All background observables are correlated among themselves due to their common dependence on $\alpha$. This scenario gives a specific evolution for the effective equation of state parameter, $w(a)$. Furthermore, we study the linear growth of matter perturbations in the context of a homogeneous expanding background driven by the entropy of the causal horizon. We find that the rate of growth of matter fluctuations in GREA slows down due to the accelerated expansion and alleviates the $\sigma_8$ tension of LCDM. We compute the growth function of matter fluctuations, the redshift space distortions in the galaxy correlation function, as well as the redshift evolution of the BAO scale, and find that the ISW effect is significantly larger than in LCDM. It is interesting to note that many of the tensions and anomalies of the standard model of cosmology are alleviated by the inclusion of this transient period of acceleration of the Universe based on known fundamental physics. In the near future we will be able to constrain this theory with present data from deep galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Symmetry Breaking: Unequal Probabilities of Vacuum Selection</title>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental notion in modern physics, ranging from high energy to condensed matter. However, the usual spontaneous symmetry breaking only considers the equal probability to select the vacua. In this work, we conceive a model to realize the unequal probability of the symmetry breaking, leading to an unbalanced number of ground states. Specifically, we study the probabilities of a scalar field to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. As the whole system is subject to random perturbations, we find that the probability for the field to roll down to the left or right side depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy, Phase Transition, and Island Rule for Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the examination of the island rule within the context of four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (4D RN-AdS) black holes, illuminating the intricate relationship between the entanglement entropy and phase transitions of black holes. The entanglement entropy of 4D RN-AdS black holes follows the anticipated linear growth pattern before ultimately declining to a constant value, in accordance with the well-established Page curve. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the influence, previously unexplored, of the first-order phase transition on the shape and evolution of the Page curve in situations involving both eternal and evaporating black holes. Despite the morphological alterations of the curve induced by the transition, the inherent unitarity of the system persists. As the evaporation progresses, the Page curve displays diverse configurations, unveiling phenomena that are novel and defies traditional expectations, thereby enriching our comprehension of the thermodynamics of black holes interlinked with quantum information.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations for binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers used to be the most promising candidate for gravitational waves for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, such as advanced LIGO and advanced VIRGO. This was proved by the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger in 2017. Numerical modeling is pivotal in predicting and interpreting binary neutron star mergers. This chapter reviews the progress of fully general relativistic magnetized binary neutron star merger simulations. From 2008 to 2024, about forty numerical relativity simulations of magnetized binary neutron star mergers were conducted with a different level of sophistication. This chapter aims to comprehensively view the magnetohydrodynamics effect in binary neutron star mergers by reviewing all the related works.</description>

      <title>The fate of boundary terms in dimensional reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>
