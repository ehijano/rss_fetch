      <title>Optimal Software Pipelining using an SMT-Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software Pipelining is a classic and important loop-optimization for VLIW processors. It improves instruction-level parallelism by overlapping multiple iterations of a loop and executing them in parallel. Typically, it is implemented using heuristics. In this paper, we present an optimal software pipeliner based on a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) Solver. We show that our approach significantly outperforms heuristic algorithms and hand-optimization. Furthermore, we show how the solver can be used to give feedback to programmers and processor designers on why a software pipelined schedule of a certain initiation interval is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Magellan: Autonomous Discovery of Novel Compiler Optimization Heuristics with AlphaEvolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.</description>

      <title>Hexcute: A Compiler Framework for Automating Layout Synthesis in GPU Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient GPU programming is crucial for achieving high performance in deep learning (DL) applications. The performance of GPU programs depends on how data is parallelized across threads and arranged within memory subsystems. The mapping functions describing tensors on GPUs are known as \emph{tensor layouts}. Low-level programming frameworks, such as CUTLASS and Hidet, provide expressive layout abstractions but often require \emph{considerable programming effort} to manually specify optimal layouts. High-level GPU programming languages, such as Triton, rely on compiler heuristics to generate dataflow, layouts, and pipelining strategies in GPU programs. However, the heuristics for dataflow and pipelining strategies are not generalizable to complex operators. To balance expressiveness and programmability, we propose Hexcute, a compiler framework that automates layout synthesis while providing explicit control over dataflow and pipelining. Hexcute formalizes layout synthesis as a constraint programming problem and solves it with a type-inference-based algorithm. This approach enables systematic exploration of optimal layouts and instructions.
  Our evaluation shows that Hexcute matches the performance of libraries like cuBLAS and FlashAttention on GEMM, Attention, and their variants, while reducing the amount of code by 1.27$\times$-7.94$\times$ compared to CUTLASS. For mixed-type mixture-of-experts (MoE) operators, Hexcute achieves an average speedup of 6.46$\times$ over Triton. In the end-to-end evaluations of vLLM, Hexcute delivers up to 2.60$\times$ speedup on DeepSeek-R1-AWQ and 2.04$\times$ on a Mamba-based model.</description>

      <title>LLMs versus the Halting Problem: Revisiting Program Termination Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</description>

      <title>Axe: A Simple Unified Layout Abstraction for Machine Learning Compilers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling modern deep learning workloads demands coordinated placement of data and compute across device meshes, memory hierarchies, and heterogeneous accelerators. We present Axe Layout, a hardware-aware abstraction that maps logical tensor coordinates to a multi-axis physical space via named axes. Axe unifies tiling, sharding, replication, and offsets across inter-device distribution and on-device layouts, enabling collective primitives to be expressed consistently from device meshes to threads. Building on Axe, we design a multi-granularity, distribution-aware DSL and compiler that composes thread-local control with collective operators in a single kernel. Experiments show that our unified approach can bring performance close to hand-tuned kernels on across latest GPU devices and multi-device environments and accelerator backends.</description>
