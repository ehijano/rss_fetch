      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of $n$-Replica Time Evolution in the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $n$-replica time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}_n(t)\equiv e^{\mathcal{L}_nt} $ for the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE) using a graph-theoretic approach. We examine the moments of the generating operator $\mathcal{L}_n$, which governs the Euclidean time evolution within an auxiliary $D^{2n}$-dimensional Hilbert space, where $D$ represents the dimension of the Hilbert space for the original system. Explicit representations for the cases of $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are derived, emphasizing the role of graph categorization in simplifying calculations. Furthermore, we present a general approach to streamline the calculation of time evolution for arbitrary $n$, supported by a detailed example of $n = 4$. Our results demonstrate that the $n$-replica framework not only facilitates the evaluation of various observables but also provides valuable insights into the relationship between Brownian disordered systems and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum thermalizers based on weakly-symmetric nonunitary multi-qubit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose incorporating multi-qubit nonunitary operations in Variational Quantum Thermalizers (VQTs). VQTs are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that generate the thermal (Gibbs) state of a given Hamiltonian, with applications in quantum algorithms and simulations. However, current algorithms struggle at intermediate temperatures, where the target state is nonpure but exhibits entanglement. We devise multi-qubit nonunitary operations that harness weak symmetries and thereby improve the performance of the algorithm. Utilizing dissipation engineering, we create these nonunitary multi-qubit operations without the need for measurements or additional qubits. To train the ansatz, we develop and benchmark novel methods for entropy estimation of quantum states, expanding the toolbox for quantum state characterization. We demonstrate that our approach can prepare thermal states of paradigmatic spin models at all temperatures. Our work thus creates new opportunities for simulating open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Iterative quantum optimisation with a warm-started quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method to prepare a warm-started quantum state from measurements with an iterative framework to enhance the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA). The numerical simulations show the method can effectively address the "stuck issue" of the standard QAOA using a single-string warm-started initial state described in [Cain et al., 2023]. When applied to the $3$-regular MaxCut problem, our approach achieves an improved approximation ratio, with a lower bound that iteratively converges toward the best classical algorithms for $p=1$ standard QAOA. Additionally, in the context of the discrete global minimal variance portfolio (DGMVP) model, simulations reveal a more favourable scaling of identifying the global minimal compared to the QAOA standalone, the single-string warm-started QAOA and a classical constrained sampling approach.</description>

      <title>Revealing correlated noise with single-qubit operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially correlated noise poses a significant challenge to fault-tolerant quantum computation by breaking the assumption of independent errors. Existing methods such as cycle benchmarking and quantum process tomography can characterize noise correlations but require substantial resources. We propose straightforward and efficient techniques to detect and quantify these correlations by leveraging collective phenomena arising from environmental correlations in a qubit register. In these techniques, single-qubit state preparations, single-qubit gates, and single-qubit measurements, combined with classical post-processing, suffice to uncover correlated relaxation and dephasing. Specifically, we use that correlated relaxation is connected to the superradiance effect which we show to be accessible by single-qubit measurements. Analogously, the established parity oscillation protocol can be refined to reveal correlated dephasing through characteristic changes in the oscillation line shape, without requiring the preparation of complex and entangled states.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness of Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to estimate non-stabilizerness or "magic", a key resource for quantum complexity, with Neural Quantum States (NQS). Our framework relies on two schemes based on Monte Carlo sampling to quantify non-stabilizerness via Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) in arbitrary variational wave functions. When combined with NQS, this approach is effective for systems with strong correlations and in dimensions larger than one, unlike Tensor Network methods. Firstly, we study the magic content in an ensemble of random NQS, demonstrating that neural network parametrizations of the wave function capture finite non-stabilizerness besides large entanglement. Secondly, we investigate the non-stabilizerness in the ground state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. In 1D, we find that the SRE vanishes at the Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2 = J_1/2$, consistent with a stabilizer ground state. In 2D, a dip in the SRE is observed near maximum frustration around $J_2/J_1 \approx 0.6$, suggesting a Valence Bond Solid between the two antiferromagnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Weak continuous measurements require more work than strong ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a dynamical model for a quantum measurement process, able to capture nonideal (weak or inefficient) measurements. In this model, the irreversibility of the measurement dynamics is due to action of a reservoir at equilibrium, which cause decoherence between the states associated with different measurement results. We analyze the performance of measurement process generated by the model, by introducing figures of merits to quantify the strength of the measurement and its efficiency. We also derive and analyze a lower bound on the measurement work cost that we can relate to the measurement quality. We take as an illustration a qubit measurement owing to its coupling to a harmonic oscillator. We investigate the long sequences of extremely short and weak measurements (a.k.a continuous measurements), to find under which conditions they converge to an ndeal measurement and analyze their work cost. Surprisingly, we find that a sequence converging towards a projective measurement has a much larger work cost than a equivalent strong measurement obtained from a single intense interaction with the apparatus. We extend this result to a large class of models owing to scaling arguments. Our analysis offer new insights into the trade-offs between measurement strength, energy consumption, and information extraction in quantum measurement protocols.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Analysis of Regev's Quantum Factorization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a significant advancement in computational capabilities. Of particular concern is its impact on asymmetric cryptography through, notably, Shor's algorithm and the more recently developed Regev's algorithm for factoring composite numbers. We present our implementation of the latter. Our analysis encompasses both quantum simulation results and classical component examples, with particular emphasis on comparative cases between Regev's and Shor's algorithms. Our experimental results reveal that Regev's algorithm indeed outperforms Shor's algorithm for certain composite numbers in practice. However, we observed significant performance variations across different input values. Despite Regev's algorithm's theoretical asymptotic efficiency advantage, our implementation exhibited execution times longer than Shor's algorithm for small integer factorization in both quantum and classical components. These findings offer insights into the practical challenges and performance characteristics of implementing Regev's algorithm in realistic quantum computing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering and Harnessing Giant Atoms in Frequency-Comb Emission and Bichromatic Correlations in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to design spectrally controlled photon emission is not only fundamentally interesting for understanding frequency-encoded light-matter interactions, but also is essential for realizing the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. Here we consider a dynamically modulated qubit array, and realize frequency-controlled single-photon emission focusing on the generation of a frequency comb constituted solely of even-parity or anti-Stokes sidebands. Our system also offers parity-dependent bunching and antibunching in frequency-filtered quantum correlations. In particular, the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup is extended to include chiral and non-local coupling architectures, thereby enhancing its versatility in Floquet engineering. Our proposal also supports the predictable generation of high-dimensional entangled quantum states, where the corresponding effective Hilbert space dimension is well controlled by energy modulation. Moreover, the utilisation of sophisticated numerical tools, such as the matrix product states (MPSs) and the discretization approach, enables the efficient simulation of multi-photon dynamics, in which the non-Markovian Floquet steady states emerge. This work fundamentally broadens the fields of collective emission, and has wide applications in implementing frequency-encoded quantum information processing and many-body quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Phase Estimation in Satellite-to-Earth Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A global continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) network can be established using a series of satellite-to-Earth channels. Increased performance in such a network is provided by performing coherent measurement of the optical quantum signals using a real local oscillator, calibrated locally by encoding known information on transmitted reference pulses and using signal phase error estimation algorithms. The speed and accuracy of the signal phase error estimation algorithm are vital to practical CV-QKD implementation. Our work provides a framework to analyze long short-term memory neural network (NN) architecture parameterization, with respect to the quantum Cram\'er-Rao uncertainty bound of the signal phase error estimation, with a focus on reducing the model complexity. More specifically, we demonstrate that signal phase error estimation can be achieved using a low-complexity NN architecture, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Our results significantly improve the real-time performance of practical CV-QKD systems deployed over satellite-to-Earth channels, thereby contributing to the ongoing development of the Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Photon Blockade with Weak Optical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional photon blockade, the occupation of a cavity mode by more than one photon is suppressed via strong optical nonlinearity. An alternative, called unconventional photon blockade, can occur under weak nonlinearity by relying on quantum interference between fine-tuned cavities. A serious limitation is the very short antibunching time window, orders of magnitude less than the cavity lifetime. We present a method to achieve photon blockade over a large time window of several cavity lifetimes, even exceeding that of conventional photon blockade, while still requiring only weak nonlinearity. This ``long-lived photon blockade'' (LLPB) occurs when the single-photon Green's function exhibits a zero at a large cavity loss rate, which is satisfied by an exemplary configuration of four coupled cavities under weak driving. Our analytical results agree well with wavefunction Monte Carlo simulations. The LLPB phenomenon may aid the development of single-photon sources utilizing materials with weak optical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Spin-squeezed vector atomic magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic magnetometers based on Zeeman shift measurement have the potential for high sensitivity and long-term stability. Like other atomic sensors including atomic clocks and atom interferometers, the atomic magnetometer could in principle be augmented with spin squeezing for further sensitivity enhancement. However, existing atomic magnetometers are not compatible with spin squeezing because the atoms can hardly be in a pure quantum state during operation. A natural challenge is the arbitrary direction of the magnetic field. In this paper, we propose a cold-atom-based magnetometer with spin squeezing that can measure both the magnitude and the direction of an arbitrary magnetic field. For experimentally accessible parameters, we show that the technique described above could achieve a sensitivity nearly three orders of magnitude higher than that of the best existing magnetometers.</description>

      <title>The state of a quantum system is not a complete description for retrodiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed quantum state can be taken as capturing an unspecified form of ignorance; or as describing the lack of knowledge about the true pure state of the system ("proper mixture"); or as arising from entanglement with another system that has been disregarded ("improper mixture"). These different views yield identical density matrices and therefore identical predictions for future measurements. But when used as prior beliefs for inferring the past state from later observations ("retrodiction"), they lead to different updated beliefs. This is a purely quantum feature of Bayesian agency. Based on this observation, we establish a framework for retrodicting on any quantum belief and we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence of beliefs. We also illustrate how these differences have operational consequences in quantum state recovery.</description>

      <title>Entangling power of Anti-Jaynes-Cummings model and its efficiency to encode information in atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangling power is crucial for quantum information processing. This study examines the Anti-Jaynes-Cummings Model (AJCM) in generating quantum correlations between two atoms interacting via the Ising model and its effect on the entangled system. The AJCM is shown to create entanglement suitable as a quantum channel for information encoding. Interaction parameters act as controls to enhance quantum correlations, increase the capacity of the final atomic state, and improve system efficiency. When the atomic system starts in a maximally entangled state, increasing interaction strength and mean photon number further boosts concurrence and channel capacity.</description>

      <title>SWAP Attack: Stealthy Side-Channel Attack on Multi-Tenant Quantum Cloud System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing has spurred widespread adoption, with cloud-based quantum devices gaining traction in academia and industry. This shift raises critical concerns about the privacy and security of computations on shared, multi-tenant quantum platforms accessed remotely. Recent studies have shown that crosstalk on shared quantum devices allows adversaries to interfere with victim circuits within a neighborhood. While insightful, these works left unresolved questions regarding the root cause of crosstalk, effective countermeasures, and replicability across circuits. We revisit the crosstalk effect, tracing its origins to the SWAP path between qubits and demonstrating its impact even over long distances. Our results significantly improve the understanding of this phenomenon beyond prior works. The proposed SWAP-based side-channel attack operates in both active and passive modes, as verified on real IBM quantum devices. In the active attack, an attacker executing a single CNOT gate can perturb victim circuits running Grover's Algorithm, reducing expected output accuracy by $81.62\%$ through strategic qubit placement. Moreover, this effect can be modeled to identify qubits more susceptible to attack. The passive attack, leveraging a stealthy circuit as small as $6.25\%$ of the victim's, achieves $100\%$ accuracy in predicting the victim's circuit size when running Simon's Algorithm. These findings challenge the existing defense strategy of maximizing topological distance between circuits, showing that attackers can still extract sensitive information or manipulate results remotely. Our work highlights the urgent need for robust security measures to safeguard quantum computations against emerging threats.</description>

      <title>Suppressing spurious transitions using spectrally balanced pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise control over quantum systems presents a significant challenge, especially in many-body setups, where residual couplings and unintended transitions undermine the accuracy of quantum operations. In superconducting qubits, parasitic interactions -- both between distant qubits and with spurious two-level systems -- can severely limit the performance of quantum gates. In this work, we introduce a pulse-shaping technique that uses spectrally balanced microwave pulses to suppress undesired transitions. Experimental results demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in spurious excitations between weakly detuned qubits, as well as a substantial decrease in single-qubit gate errors caused by a strongly coupled two-level defect over a broad frequency range. Our method provides a simple yet powerful solution to mitigate adverse effects from parasitic couplings, enhancing the fidelity of quantum operations and expanding feasible frequency allocations for large-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal routing induced by chirality in an atom-dimer waveguide-QED system</title>

Abstract: The implementation of quantum routers is an important and desired task in quantum information science, since quantum routers are important components of quantum networks. Here, we propose a scheme for implementing single-photon routers in a waveguide-QED system, which consists of two coupled two-level atoms coupled to two waveguides to form a four-port quantum device. We obtain the exact analytical expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes using the real-space method. By taking the propagating time of photons between two coupling points into account or not, we consider the system working in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, respectively. In addition, we introduce the chiral coupling, which breaks the symmetry of the waveguide model, to manipulate the transmission of single photons. We find that when the system works in the non-Markovian regime, the single photon can be transmitted on demand by adjusting the asymmetry coefficient. More interestingly, the complete single-photon routing in this device does not require an ideal chiral coupling, loosening the photon transport conditions. This work will motivate the studies concerning the nonreciprocal and chiral quantum devices in the waveguide-QED platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ``local uncertainty relations'' in thermal many-body systems, from which fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds (e.g., those of the diffusion constant and viscosity) that are compared against experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks for Cloud Cover Parameterizations in Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term climate projections require running global Earth system models on timescales of hundreds of years and have relatively coarse resolution (from 40 to 160 km in the horizontal) due to their high computational costs. Unresolved subgrid-scale processes, such as clouds, are described in a semi-empirical manner by so called parameterizations, which are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Machine learning models trained on short high-resolution climate simulations are promising candidates to replace conventional parameterizations. In this work, we explore the potential of quantum machine learning (QML), and in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), to develop cloud cover parameterizations. QNNs differ from their classical counterparts, and their potentially high expressivity turns them into promising tools for accurate data-driven schemes to be used in climate models. We perform an extensive comparative analysis between several QNNs and classical neural networks (NNs), by training both ansatzes on data coming from high-resolution simulations with the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic weather and climate model (ICON). Our results show that the overall performance of the investigated QNNs is comparable to that of classical NNs of similar size, i.e., with the same number of trainable parameters, with both ansatzes outperforming standard parameterizations used in climate models. Our study includes an analysis of the generalization ability of the models as well as the geometrical properties of their optimization landscape. We also investigate the effects of finite sampling noise, and show that the training and the predictions of the QNNs are stable even in this noisy setting. These results demonstrate the applicability of QML to learn meaningful patterns in climate data, and are thus relevant for a broad range of problems within the climate modeling community.</description>

      <title>Implicit solvent sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method shows great promise in quantum-centric simulations of ground state energies in molecular systems. Inclusion of solute-solvent interactions in simulations of electronic structure is critical for biochemical and medical applications. However, all of the previous applications of the SQD method were shown for gas-phase simulations of the electronic structure. The present work aims to bridge this gap by introducing the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) of solvent into the SQD calculations. We perform SQD/cc-pVDZ IEF-PCM simulations of methanol, methylamine, ethanol, and water in aqueous solution using quantum hardware and compare our results to CASCI/cc-pVDZ IEF-PCM simulations. Our simulations on ibm_cleveland, ibm_kyiv, and ibm_marrakesh quantum devices are performed with 27, 30, 41, and 52 qubits demonstrating the scalability of SQD IEF-PCM simulations.</description>

      <title>Precise Quantum Control of Molecular Rotation Toward a Desired Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of a direct map between control fields and desired control objectives poses a significant challenge in applying quantum control theory to quantum technologies. Here, we propose an analytical framework to precisely control a limited set of quantum states and construct desired coherent superpositions using a well-designed laser pulse sequence with optimal amplitudes, phases, and delays. This theoretical framework that corresponds to a multi-level pulse-area theorem establishes a straightforward mapping between the control parameters of the pulse sequence and the amplitudes and phases of rotational states within a specific subspace. As an example, we utilize this approach to generate 15 distinct and desired rotational superpositions of ultracold polar molecules, leading to 15 desired field-free molecular orientations. By optimizing the superposition of the lowest 16 rotational states, we demonstrate that this approach can achieve a maximum orientation value of $|\langle\cos\theta\rangle|_{\rm{max}}$ above 0.99, which is very close to the global optimal value of 1 that could be achieved in an infinite-dimensional state space. This work marks a significant advancement in achieving precise control over multi-level subsystems within molecules. It holds potential applications in molecular alignment and orientation, as well as in various interdisciplinary fields related to the precise quantum control of ultracold polar molecules, opening up considerable opportunities in molecular-based quantum techniques.</description>

      <title>Variational optical phase learning on a continuous-variable quantum compiler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process learning is a fundamental primitive that draws inspiration from machine learning with the goal of better studying the dynamics of quantum systems. One approach to quantum process learning is quantum compilation, whereby an analog quantum operation is digitized by compiling it into a series of basic gates. While there has been significant focus on quantum compiling for discrete-variable systems, the continuous-variable (CV) framework has received comparatively less attention. We present an experimental implementation of a CV quantum compiler that uses two mode-squeezed light to learn a Gaussian unitary operation. We demonstrate the compiler by learning a parameterized linear phase unitary through the use of target and control phase unitaries to demonstrate a factor of 5.4 increase in the precision of the phase estimation and a 3.6-fold acceleration in the time-to-solution metric when leveraging quantum resources. Our results are enabled by the tunable control of our cost landscape via variable squeezing, thus providing a critical framework to simultaneously increase precision and reduce time-to-solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital teleportation protocols make use of entanglement, local measurements and a classical communication channel to transfer quantum states between remote parties. We consider analog teleportation protocols, where classical communication is replaced by transmission through a noisy quantum channel. We show that analog teleportation protocols outperform digital protocols if and only if Alice and Bob are linked by a channel that does not reduce the entanglement of its input state. We first derive general analytical results in the broader context of Gaussian-channel simulation. Then, we apply it to the quantum teleportation of a uniformly distributed codebook of coherent states, showing that an analog protocol is optimal for a wide range of communication channel transmissivities. Our result is relevant in the intermediate case when the communication channel is far from being ideal but is not too lossy, as is the case of cryogenic links in microwave superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Investigation of intrinsic nonlinear effects in driven-dissipative optomechanical systems using the generalized linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of intrinsic nonlinear optomechanical interaction on the linear response of a driven-dissipative optomechanical system to a weak time-dependent perturbation. By calculating the linear response of the cavity optical mode to a weak probe laser in the framework of the generalized linear response theory, it is shown how the Stokes and anti-Stokes sideband amplitudes as well as the power reflection coefficient, and the density of states of the cavity optical mode are expressed in terms of photonic retarded Green's functions. Then, we derive the equations of motion of retarded Green's functions of the system from nonlinear quantum Langevin equations and solve them. It is shown that for a single-photon optomechanical coupling of the order of the cavity linewidth, the nonlinear effect does not manifest itself unless the system satisfies a resonance condition, where the frequency of the upper normal mode of the system is twice that of the lower one. Based on the generality of the present approach which works at all regimes, the validity of linearization approximation is also confirmed at the off-resonance regime.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the status of security proofs for practical decoy-state Quantum Key Distribution using the BB84 protocol, pertaining to optical implementations using weak coherent pulses and threshold photo-detectors. Our focus is on the gaps in the existing literature. Gaps might result, for example, from a mismatch of protocol detail choices and proof technique elements, from proofs relying on earlier results that made different assumptions, or from protocol choices that do not consider real-world requirements. While substantial progress has been made, our overview draws attention to the details that still require our attention.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Jaynes cummings model as an autonomous thermodynamic machine, where a qubit is coupled to a cavity with a very large initial coherent field. Our analysis reveals different behaviors of this model including the expected unitary behavior of qubit at short times, which fails at longer times when the cavity starts measuring the qubit. The subsequent dynamics feature feedback from the cavity on the qubit, which appears to purify the qubit irrespective of its initial state. Upon analyzing these dynamics from a thermodynamic standpoint, we found that the cavity behaves as an autonomous Maxwell demon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum measurements have been shown to constitute a resource for operating quantum thermal machines, the nature of the energy exchanges involved in the interaction between system and measurement apparatus is still under debate. In this work, we show that a microscopic model of the apparatus is necessary to unambiguously determine whether quantum measurements provide energy in the form of heat or work. We illustrate this result by considering a measurement-based refrigerator, made of a double quantum dot embedded in a two-terminal device, with the charge of one of the dots being continuously monitored. Tuning the parameters of the measurement device interpolates between a heat- and a work-fueled regimes with very different thermodynamic efficiency. Notably, we demonstrate a trade-off between a maximal thermodynamic efficiency when the measurement-based refrigerator is fueled by heat and a maximal measurement efficiency quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio in the work-fueled regime. Our analysis offers a new perspective on the nature of the energy exchanges occurring during a quantum measurement, paving the way for energy optimization in quantum protocols and quantum machines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and benchmark an interesting circuit family which we call diamond circuits, that use a mid-cycle construction built around the subsystem surface code to implement a surface code on a Lieb or "Heavy-Square" lattice. This makes them more qubit- and measurement-efficient than previous constructions. These circuits are described via the LUCI framework, and are effectively circuits with half the measure qubits dropped out of the grid. These circuits preserve the spacelike distance of the code, but suffer a penalty in timelike distance, and could be useful in regimes where quantum computers are limited by frequency collisions or number of control lines.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. That significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states and is responsible for an unconventional form of transport. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport; counterintuitively, quantum many-body scars are completely irrelevant for the aforementioned mechanism. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A smoking gun for our current paradigm of the early universe would be direct evidence for the quantum mechanical origin of density perturbations which are conjectured to seed the large scale structure of our universe. A recently-proposed novel phenomenon is that of \textit{recoherence}, wherein a specific interaction between the adiabatic and the entropic sector leads to the adiabatic mode retaining a coherent state after a transient increase in linear entropy. In this paper, we choose the most general Gaussian action and analyze the evolution of linear entropy, complexity of purification (COP), and complexity of formation (COF) to capture the interplay between decoherence and recoherence in this model. In the presence of two types of couplings that drive these two opposing characteristics, we highlight how COF is an efficient tool for diagnosing dynamics for such an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum in cuprous oxide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a realistic semiconductor system containing bound states in the continuum (BICs) which allows for a practical realization. By varying the confinement strength of excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, we show that long-lived Rydberg states of the confined electron-hole pairs appear in the continuum background. The accuracy of calculations of the linewidths based on the coupled-channel Schr\"odinger equation with three channels and only few basis states is confirmed by a numerically exact solution employing a B-spline basis and the complex coordinate-rotation method. We argue that finite-sized cuprous oxide crystals, due to their large exciton binding energies, are a convenient platform for experimental identification of BICs.</description>

      <title>Determining angle of arrival of radio frequency fields using subwavelength, amplitude-only measurements of standing waves in a Rydberg atom sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep subwavelength RF imaging with atomic Rydberg sensors has overcome fundamental limitations of traditional antennas and enabled ultra-wideband detection of omni-directional time varying fields all in a compact form factor. However, in most applications, Rydberg sensors require the use of a secondary strong RF reference field to serve as a phase reference. Here, we demonstrate a new type of Rydberg sensor for angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing which utilizes subwavelength imaging of standing wave fields. By placing a metallic plate within the Rydberg cell, we can determine the AoA independent of the strength of incoming RF field and without requiring a secondary strong RF phase reference field. We perform precision AoA measurements with a robotic antenna positioning system for 4.2, 5.0, and 5.7 GHz signals and demonstrate a 1.7 deg polar angular resolution from 0 deg to 60 deg AoA and 4.1 deg over all possible angles.</description>

      <title>Atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions under the influence of spin-dependent Rydberg molecular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the energy spectrum and eigenstates of two-component atomic Fermi superfluids with tunable pairing interactions in the presence of spin-dependent ultra long-range Rydberg molecule (ULRM) potentials, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism. The attractive ULRM potentials lead to local density accumulation, while their difference results in a local polarization potential and induces the in-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states whose energies lie below the bulk energy gap. A transition from equal-population to population-imbalance occurs as the pairing strength falls below a critical value, accompanied by the emergence of local Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like states characterized by out-of-phase wave functions and lower energies compared to the YSR states. The negative contribution emanating from the FFLO-like states also causes a sign change in the gap function within the ULRM potentials. Depending on the Rydberg state generating the ULRM potentials, the transition towards population-imbalance can be on either the BCS or the Bose-Einstein condensation side of the Fermi superfluid. Additionally, spin-polarized bound states arise along with oscillatory ``clumpy states" to compensate for the local density difference. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations and measurements of the composite Rydberg atom-Fermi superfluid system.</description>

      <title>Effects of finite trapping on the decay, recoil, and decoherence of dark states of quantum emitter arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective interaction of electronic excitations with the electromagnetic field in atomic arrays can lead to significantly reduced decay rates, resulting in the formation of subradiant states with promising applications in quantum information and quantum memories. In many previous studies, atoms are assumed to be perfectly positioned and fixed. In this work, we investigate the effects of finite trap strength on the long-lived subradiant states for two, three, and many atoms in a 1D waveguide or free space. We demonstrate that the decay rate is lower bounded by the spatial spread of the motional wavefunction, which is non-zero even for the vibrational ground state. Additionally, in relatively tight traps, the decay of a shared electronic excitation imparts recoil energy to the atoms, which is proportional to the lifetime of the excited state. In a 1D waveguide, this energy can reach a vibrational quantum, even in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Furthermore, for atoms in weaker traps, the induced dipole forces become significant, causing the atoms to undergo motion prior to decay. This motion results in a time-dependent decay rate, an additional energy transfer to the atoms following decay, and mixing between the different electronic eigenstates. Consequently, these effects lead to decoherence and a reduction in the fidelity of a stored electronic eigenstate. Infidelity can be mitigated by either decreasing the induced forces or increasing the trap strength. For quantum information storage, these considerations suggest optimal array configurations, both in terms of geometric arrangements and polarization directions. Our findings provide insights for the behavior of quantum memories and atom array experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review some methods that tried to solve the information loss problem. In particular, we revisit the solution based on Hawking radiation as tunneling, and provide a detailed statistical interpretation on the black hole entropy in terms of the quantum tunneling probability of Hawking radiation from the black hole. In addition, we show that black hole evaporation is governed by a time-dependent Schrodinger equation that sends pure states into pure states rather than into mixed states (Hawking had originally established that the final result would be mixed states). This is further confirmation of the fact that black hole evaporation is unitary.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle mimicking dynamical Dark Energy: matter perturbations and gravitational wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) stands out as a nearly ubiquitous feature in quantum gravity modeling, predicting the emergence of a minimum length at the Planck scale. Recently, it has been shown to modify the area-law scaling of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, giving rise to deformed Friedmann equations within Jacobson's approach. The ensuing model incorporates the GUP correction as a quintessence-like dark energy that supplements the cosmological constant, influencing the dynamics of the early Universe while aligning with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm in the current epoch. In this extended scenario, we examine the growth of matter perturbations and structure formation employing the Top-Hat Spherical Collapse approach. Our analysis reveals that the profile of the density contrast is sensitive to the GUP parameter $\beta$, resulting in a slower gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations in the matter density. We also discuss implications for the relic density of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying the parameter space that enhances the PGW spectrum. Using the sensitivity of the next-generation GW observatories in the frequency range below $10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$, we constrain $\beta\lesssim10^{39}$, which is more stringent than most other cosmological/astrophysical limits. This finding highlights the potential role of GWs in the pursuit of understanding quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We study the exchange of energy between gravitational and electromagnetic waves in a Sagnac type geometry, in analogy to an ``optical Weber bar.'' In the presence of a gravitational wave (such as the ones measured by LIGO), we find that it should be possible to observe signatures of stimulated emission or absorption of gravitons with present day technology. Apart from marking the transition from passively observing to actively manipulating such a natural phenomenon, this could also be used as a complementary detection scheme. Non-classical photon states may improve the sensitivity and might even allow us to test certain quantum aspects of the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dephasing is the loss of phase coherence due to the interaction of an electron with the environment. The most common approach to model dephasing in light-matter interaction is the relaxation time approximation. Surprisingly, its use in intense laser physics results in a pronounced failure, because ionization {is highly overestimated.} Here, this shortcoming is corrected by developing a strong field model in which the many-body environment is represented by a heat bath. Our model reveals that ionization enhancement and suppression by several orders of magnitude are still possible, however only in more extreme parameter regimes. Our approach allows the integration of many-body physics into intense laser dynamics with minimal computational and mathematical complexity, thus facilitating the identification of novel effects in strong-field physics and attosecond {science}.</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split-CTMRG approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Many-body theory calculations of positron binding to parabenzoquinone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron binding in parabenzoquinone is studied using \textit{ab initio} many-body theory. The effects of electron-positron correlations including polarization, virtual positronium formation and positron-hole repulsion, as well as those of $\pi$ bonds, aromaticity, and lone electron pairs, are considered. The binding energy is calculated as 60$\pm$16 meV, considerably larger than the 0.0925 meV value inferred from recent scattering calculations of [G. Moreira and M. Bettega, {\emph{Eur.~Phys.~J.~D}} {\bf 78} (2024)], but substantially smaller than we find in benzene (148$\pm$26 meV). The positron contact density (lifetime) is calculated as 8.0$\times10^{-3}$ a.u. (2.48 ns), vs.~1.61$\times 10^{-2}$ a.u. (0.81 ns) in benzene. The decrease (increase) in binding (annihilation rate) in parabenzoquinone compared to benzene is ascribed to the loss of aromaticity: the electron density on the positive oxygen nuclei being relatively harder for the positron to probe compared to the aromatic rings in benzene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</description>

      <title>On proving the robustness of algorithms for early fault-tolerant quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hope of the quantum computing field is that quantum architectures are able to scale up and realize fault-tolerant quantum computing. Due to engineering challenges, such ''cheap'' error correction may be decades away. In the meantime, we anticipate an era of ''costly'' error correction, or early fault-tolerant quantum computing. Costly error correction might warrant settling for error-prone quantum computations. This motivates the development of quantum algorithms which are robust to some degree of error as well as methods to analyze their performance in the presence of error. Several such algorithms have recently been developed; what is missing is a methodology to analyze their robustness. To this end, we introduce a randomized algorithm for the task of phase estimation and give an analysis of its performance under two simple noise models. In both cases the analysis leads to a noise threshold, below which arbitrarily high accuracy can be achieved by increasing the number of samples used in the algorithm. As an application of this general analysis, we compute the maximum ratio of the largest circuit depth and the dephasing scale such that performance guarantees hold. We calculate that the randomized algorithm can succeed with arbitrarily high probability as long as the required circuit depth is less than 0.916 times the dephasing scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Circuit locality from relativistic locality in scalar field mediated entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locality is a central notion in modern physics, but different disciplines understand it in different ways. Quantum field theory focuses on relativistic locality, based on spacetime regions, while quantum information theory focuses circuit locality, based on the notion of subsystems. Here, we investigate how spacetime and subsystem locality are related in the context of systems getting entangled while interacting via a scalar field. We show how, when the systems are put in a quantum-controlled superposition of localised states, relativistic locality (in the form of microcausality) gives rise to a specific kind of circuit. The relation between these forms of locality is relevant for understanding whether it is possible to formulate quantum field theory in quantum circuit language, and has bearing on the recent discussions on low-energy tests of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. Here, we present a novel $CC\Phi$ quantum phase gate protocol based on radio-frequency-induced F\"{o}rster resonant interactions in the array of highly excited $^{87}$Rb atoms. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by RF field application enables high-fidelity and robust gate performance for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, as well as it significantly facilitates the experimental implementation of the gate protocol. Taking into account finite Rydberg states lifetimes, we achieve an average theoretical gate fidelity of $99.27 \%$ under room-temperature conditions (improved up to $99.65 \%$ in a cryogenic environment), thus showing the protocol compatibility with modern quantum error correction techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing has demonstrated how quantum Zeno can be used to construct quantum optimisers. However, much less work has been done to understand how more general Zeno effects could be used in a similar setting. We use a construction based on three state systems rather than directly in qubits, so that a qubit can remain after projecting out one of the states. We find that our model of computing is able to recover the dynamics of a transverse field Ising model, several generalisations are possible, but our methods allow for constraints to be implemented non-perturbatively and does not need tunable couplers, unlike simple transverse field implementations. We further discuss how to implement the protocol physically using methods building on STIRAP protocols for state transfer. We find a substantial challenge, that settings defined exclusively by measurement or dissipative Zeno effects do not allow for frustration, and in these settings pathological spectral features arise leading to unfavorable runtime scaling. We discuss methods to overcome this challenge for example including gain as well as loss as is often done in an optical setting.</description>

      <title>Ising Hamiltonian Minimization: Gain-Based Computing with Manifold Reduction of Soft-Spins vs Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the minimization of Ising Hamiltonians, comparing the performance of gain-based computing paradigms based on the dynamics of semi-classical soft-spin models with quantum annealing. We systematically analyze how the energy landscape for the circulant couplings of a Mobius graph evolves with increased annealing parameters. Our findings indicate that these semi-classical models face challenges due to a widening dimensionality landscape. To counteract this issue, we introduce the `manifold reduction' method, which restricts the soft-spin amplitudes to a defined phase space region. Concurrently, quantum annealing demonstrates a natural capability to navigate the Ising Hamiltonian's energy landscape due to its operation within the comprehensive Hilbert space. Our study indicates that physics-inspired or physics-enhanced optimizers will likely benefit from combining classical and quantum annealing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using the dynamical invariant also known as the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant, to speed-up the equilibration of a driven open quantum system. This allows us to reverse engineer the time-dependent master equation that describes the dynamics of the open quantum system and systematically derive a protocol that realizes a shortcut to equilibration. The method does not require additional constraints on the timescale of the dynamics beside the Born-Markov approximation and can be generically applied to boost single particle quantum engines significantly. We demonstrate it with the damped harmonic oscillator, and show that our protocol can achieve a high-fidelity control in shorter timescales than simple non-optimized protocols. We find that the system is heated during the dynamics to speed-up the equilibration, which can be considered as an analogue of the Mpemba effect in quantum control.</description>

      <title>Fast classical simulation of quantum circuits via parametric rewriting in the ZX-calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently, it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate an average speedup factor of 78.3+-10.2 for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum extension of dynamic programming, a fundamental computational method that efficiently solves recursive problems using memory. Our innovation lies in showing how to coherently generate recursion step unitaries by using memorized intermediate quantum states. Quantum dynamic programming achieves an exponential reduction in circuit depth for a broad class of fixed-point quantum recursions, though this comes at the cost of increased circuit width. Interestingly, the trade-off becomes more favourable when the initial state is pure. By hybridizing our approach with a conventional memoryless one, we can flexibly balance circuit depth and width to optimize performance on quantum devices with fixed hardware constraints. Finally, we showcase applications of quantum dynamic programming to several quantum recursions, including a variant of Grover's search, quantum imaginary-time evolution, and a new protocol for obliviously preparing a quantum state in its Schmidt basis.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning using Machine Learning Models Trained with Continuous Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build upon recent work on using Machine Learning models to estimate Hamiltonian parameters using continuous weak measurement of qubits as input. We consider two settings for the training of our model: (1) supervised learning where the weak measurement training record can be labeled with known Hamiltonian parameters, and (2) unsupervised learning where no labels are available. The first has the advantage of not requiring an explicit representation of the quantum state, thus potentially scaling very favorably to larger number of qubits. The second requires the implementation of a physical model to map the Hamiltonian parameters to a measurement record, which we implement using an integrator of the physical model with a recurrent neural network to provide a model-free correction at every time step to account for small effects not captured by the physical model. We test our construction on a system of two qubits and demonstrate accurate prediction of multiple physical parameters in both the supervised and unsupervised context. We demonstrate that the model benefits from larger training sets establishing that it is in fact "learning," and we show robustness to errors in the assumed physical model by achieving accurate parameter estimation in the presence of unanticipated single particle relaxation.</description>

Abstract: Continuing our analysis of quantum machine learning applied to our use-case of malware detection, we investigate the potential of quantum convolutional neural networks. More precisely, we propose a new architecture where data is uploaded all along the quantum circuit. This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the optimal control of a continuous variable system, focusing on entanglement generation in an optomechanical system without utilizing Fock basis cutoffs. Using the Krotov algorithm to optimize the dynamics of the covariance matrix, we illustrated how to design a control objective function to manipulate the dynamics of the system to generate a desirable target state. We showed that entanglement between the macroscopic mechanical mirror and the quantum optical cavity can be reliably generated through imposing the control on the detuning of the external laser field. It has be shown that the control may be still achieved when imposing spectral constraints on the external field to restrict it to low-frequency components. In addition, we systematically studies the effects of quantum control on non-Markovian open system dynamics. We observed that memory effects can play a beneficial role in mitigating the detrimental impact of environmental noises. Specifically, the entanglement generated shows reduced decay in the presence of these memory effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures, to realize a long-range quantum network mediated by flying photon, it is necessary to shape the temporal profile of emitted photons to achieve high transfer efficiency between two quantum nodes. In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), trial states are prepared by applying series of parameterized gates to a reference state, with the gate parameters being varied to minimize the energy of the target system. Recognizing that the gates are intermediates which are ultimately compiled into a set of control pulses to be applied to each qubit in the lab, the recently proposed ctrl-VQE algorithm takes the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of the pulse as the variational parameters used to minimize the molecular energy. In this work, we explore how all three degrees of freedom interrelate with one another. To this end, we consider several distinct strategies to parameterize the control pulses, assessing each one through numerical simulations of a transmon-like device. For each parameterization, we contrast the pulse duration required to prepare a good ansatz, and the difficulty to optimize that ansatz from a well-defined initial state. We deduce several guiding heuristics to implement practical ctrl-VQE in hardware, which we anticipate will generalize for generic device architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important quantities characterizing the microscopic properties of quantum systems are dynamical correlation functions. These correlations are obtained by time-evolving a perturbation of an eigenstate of the system, typically the ground state. In this work, we study approximations of these correlation functions that do not require time dynamics. We show that having access to a circuit that prepares an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is possible to approximate the dynamical correlation functions up to exponential accuracy in the complex frequency domain $\omega=\Re(\omega)+i\Im(\omega)$, on a strip above the real line $\Im(\omega)=0$. We achieve this by exploiting the continued fraction representation of the dynamical correlation functions as functions of frequency $\omega$, where the level $k$ approximant can be obtained by measuring a weight $O(k)$ operator on the eigenstate of interest. In the complex $\omega$ plane, we show how this approach allows to determine approximations to correlation functions with accuracy that increases exponentially with $k$.
  We analyse two algorithms to generate the continuous fraction representation in scalar or matrix form, starting from either one or many initial operators. We prove that these algorithms generate an exponentially accurate approximation of the dynamical correlation functions on a region sufficiently far away from the real frequency axis. We present numerical evidence of these theoretical results through simulations of small lattice systems. We comment on the stability of these algorithms with respect to sampling noise in the context of quantum simulation using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Annealing Dynamics of Regular Rotor Networks: Universality and Its Breakdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-vector Monte Carlo model is widely used as a benchmark for the classicality of quantum annealers but severely restricts the time evolution. The spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model has been proposed and tested as an alternative, closely reproducing the real-time dynamics of physical quantum annealers such as D-Wave machines in the dissipative regime. We investigate the SVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying universal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of interactions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance or edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of defects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the interaction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an exponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a universal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems characterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous findings in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Crossing Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal driving of the ground state of a many-body quantum system across a quantum phase transition in finite time. In this context, excitations caused by the breakdown of adiabaticity can be minimized by adjusting the schedule of the control parameter that drives the transition. Drawing inspiration from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, we characterize the timescale of onset of adiabaticity for several optimal control procedures. Our analysis reveals that schedules relying on local adiabaticity, such as Roland-Cerf's local adiabatic driving and the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, fail to provide a significant speedup over the adiabatic evolution in the transverse-field Ising and long-range Kitaev models. As an alternative, we introduce a novel framework, Non-Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (NAQO), that, by exploiting the Landau-Zener formula and taking into account the role of higher-excited states, outperforms schedules obtained via both local adiabaticity and state-of-the-art numerical optimization. NAQO is not restricted to exactly solvable models, and we further confirm its superior performance in a disordered non-integrable model.</description>

      <title>Controlling the superradiant phase transition in the quantum Rabi model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ultrastrong-coupling regime, the quantum Rabi model can exhibit quantum phase transition (QPT) when the ratio of the qubit transition frequency to the frequency of the cavity field approaches infinity. However, it is challenging to control the QPT in few-body systems because of the limited coupling strength and the A^2 term. Here, we propose a practical scheme to manipulate the QPT of the quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime. By applying a periodic frequency modulation to the two-level system in a quantum Rabi model in the strong-coupling regime, an anisotropic quantum Rabi model with ultrastrong and tunable coupling strengths for rotating and counterrotating terms is obtained. The ground state and excitation energy of this model, in terms of the modulation parameters, are studied. We find that the QPT of the quantum Rabi model can be observed in the strong-coupling regime and externally controlled by the modulation.</description>

      <title>On multivariate polynomials achievable with quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) is a framework which was proven to unify and simplify a large number of known quantum algorithms, as well as discovering new ones. QSP allows one to transform a signal embedded in a given unitary using polynomials. Characterizing which polynomials can be achieved with QSP protocols is an important part of the power of this technique, and while such a characterization is well-understood in the case of univariate signals, it is unclear which multivariate polynomials can be constructed when the signal is a vector, rather than a scalar. This work uses a slightly different formalism than what is found in the literature, and uses it to find simpler necessary conditions for decomposability, as well as a sufficient condition -- the first, to the best of our knowledge, proven for a (generally inhomogeneous) multivariate polynomial in the context of quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Minimal operational theories: classical theories with quantum features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic theories, termed Minimal Strongly Causal Operational Probabilistic Theories, where system dynamics are constrained to the minimal set of operations consistent with the set of states and permitting conditional tests. Specifically, the allowed instruments are limited to those derived from compositions of preparations, measurements, swap transformations, and conditional operations. We demonstrate that minimal theories with conditioning and a spanning set of non-separable states satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a key example, we construct Minimal Strongly Causal Bilocal Classical Theory, a classical toy-theory that lacks incompatible measurements, preparation uncertainty relations, and is noncontextual (both Kochen-Specker and generalised), yet exhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without disturbance, and no-broadcasting. Therefore, the latter three properties cannot be understood $\textit{per se}$ as signatures of non-classicality. We further explore distinctions between a theory and its minimal strongly causal counterpart, showing that while the minimal strongly causal version of quantum theory diverges from full quantum theory, the same does not hold for classical theory. Additionally, we establish the pairwise independence of the properties of simpliciality, strong causality, and local discriminability.</description>

      <title>The spin-one Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation revisited: analytical study of its structure and a careful choice of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation is investigated for spin one bosons with the so-called natural (normal) and unnatural (abnormal) parity states for non-minimal vector interactions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge about the equation, a thorough but concise discussion is made on what can be achieved analytically within this framework for well-known phenomenological interactions, including Coulomb, soft-core, Cornell, Kratzer, and exponential type interactions. In the non-exponential cases, the equation, depending on the chosen interaction, is studied in relation to the confluent, doubly-confluent, and biconfluent Heun functions. Furthermore, to show the need for careful treatment of various parity states, a Kratzer-type potential, such as a generalized Coulomb interaction, is discussed in depth using the Lie algebraic approach, showing the need for careful analysis of abnormal parity states in a fairly explicit way. The energies obtained are discussed using some figures to explicitly show the different regimes, as well as the absence of the Klein paradox. Finally, some directions for future work that would undoubtedly need to be explored in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Simulating Quantum Light in Lossy Microring Resonators Driven by Strong Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum theory for pulsed photon pair generation in a single ring resonator. Our approach combines the Heisenberg picture input-output formalism with the Ikeda mapping from classical nonlinear optics. In doing so, we address the high-gain regime by incorporating non-perturbative effects, including self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation, and time-ordering, which are roots for significantly different behaviors in the low-gain regime. We also account for optical losses by introducing an auxiliary waveguide, allowing for a more accurate representation of experimentally viable scenarios. Numerical simulations reveal that non-perturbative effects significantly distort transfer functions, making desirable operations challenging without careful optimization. We show that appropriate detuning of the pump frequency can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced brightness and higher spectral purity in the high-gain regime. We further investigate the performance of a single ring resonator as a two-mode squeezer by analyzing various performance metrics under experimentally relevant optical loss conditions.</description>

      <title>Application of Langevin Dynamics to Advance the Quantum Natural Gradient Optimization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) algorithm for optimization of variational quantum circuits has been proposed recently. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation with a QNG stochastic force to demonstrate that its discrete-time solution gives a generalized form of the above-specified algorithm, which we call Momentum-QNG. Similar to other optimization algorithms with the momentum term, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, RMSProp with momentum and Adam, Momentum-QNG is more effective to escape local minima and plateaus in the variational parameter space and, therefore, achieves a better convergence behavior compared to the basic QNG. In this paper we benchmark Momentum-QNG together with basic QNG, Adam and Momentum optimizers and find the optimal values of its hyperparameters. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/borbysh/Momentum-QNG</description>

      <title>Limited Parallelization in Gate Operations Leads to Higher Space Overhead and Lower Noise Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a modern error corrected quantum memory or circuit, parallelization of gate operations is severely restricted due to issues like cross-talk. Hence, there are enough idle qubits not undergoing gate operations either during the computation phase or during the error correction phase, which suffer further decoherence while waiting. Thus, in reality, the space overhead and the noise threshold would depend on the level of gate parallelization. In this paper, we obtain an analytical lower bound on the required space overhead in terms of the level of parallelization for an error correction framework that has more error correction capability than the existing ones. We consider two types of errors: i.i.d. erasure and depolarization. In comparison to the known lower bounds which assume full gate parallelization, our bound is provably strictly larger despite allowing more capability to the error correction framework. This shows the steep price to be paid for lack of gate parallelization. An implication of the bound is that the noise or decoherence threshold, i.e., the noise beyond which no fault-tolerant memory or circuit can be realized, vanishes if the number of parallel gate operations does not scale linearly with the number of physical qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement induced by noise in inhomogeneously monitored systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how stronger noise can enhance the entanglement in inhomogeneously monitored quantum systems. We consider a free fermions model composed of two coupled chains - a system chain and an ancilla chain, each subject to its own different noise - and explore the dynamics of entanglement within the system chain under different noise intensities. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to the detrimental effects typically associated with noise, certain regimes of noise on the ancilla can significantly enhance entanglement within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of such entanglement enhancement across various system sizes and noise parameters. This enhancement is found to be highly dependent on the hopping strength in the ancilla, suggesting that the interplay between unitary dynamics and noise can be tuned to optimize the entanglement of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted R\'enyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.</description>

      <title>Exploring Channel Distinguishability in Local Neighborhoods of the Model Space in Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing interest in Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged and gained significant attention. These models have, however, been shown to be notoriously difficult to train, which we hypothesize is partially due to the architectures, called ansatzes, that are hardly studied at this point. Therefore, in this paper, we take a step back and analyze ansatzes. We initially consider their expressivity, i.e., the space of operations they are able to express, and show that the closeness to being a 2-design, the primarily used measure, fails at capturing this property. Hence, we look for alternative ways to characterize ansatzes by considering the local neighborhood of the model space, in particular, analyzing model distinguishability upon small perturbation of parameters. We derive an upper bound on their distinguishability, showcasing that QNNs with few parameters are hardly discriminable upon update. Our numerical experiments support our bounds and further indicate that there is a significant degree of variability, which stresses the need for warm-starting or clever initialization. Altogether, our work provides an ansatz-centric perspective on training dynamics and difficulties in QNNs, ultimately suggesting that iterative training of small quantum models may not be effective, which contrasts their initial motivation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we use the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory to investigate the Casimir force between flat, ideally conductive surfaces containing confined, but mobile ions. We demonstrate that, in the Gaussian approximation, the ionic fluctuations contribute separately from the electromagnetic fluctuations that are responsible for the standard Casimir effect. This is in line with the "separation hypothesis", has been previously applied on a purely intuitive basis. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of calculating the zero Matsubara frequency component in the electromagnetic contribution, using the formula developed by Schwinger et al., as opposed to the approach based on Lifshitz theory used by other researchers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Purcell enhancement and optical coherence of Eu$^{\text{3+}}$ ions in a single nanoparticle coupled to a microcavity</title>

Abstract: Europium-doped nanocrystals constitute a promising material for a scalable future quantum computing platform. Long-lived nuclear spin states could serve as qubits addressed via coherent optical transitions. In order to realize an efficient spin-photon interface, we couple the emission from a single nanoparticle to a fiber-based microcavity under cryogenic conditions. The spatial and spectral tunability of the cavity permits us to place individual nanoparticles in the cavity, to measure the inhomogeneous linewidth of the ions, and to show a multi-modal Purcell-enhancement of two transition in Eu$^{\text{3+}}$. A halving of the free-space lifetime to 1.0 ms is observed, corresponding to a 140-fold enhancement of the respective transition. Furthermore, we observe a narrow optical linewidth of 3.3 MHz for a few-ion ensemble in the center of the inhomogeneous line. The results represent an important step towards the efficient readout of single Eu$^{\text{3+}}$ ions, a key requirement for the realization of single-ion-level quantum processing nodes in the solid state.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Quantum Computation without Distillation on a 2D Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how looped pipeline architectures - which use short-range shuttling of physical qubits to achieve a finite amount of non-local connectivity - can be used to efficiently implement the fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate between 2D surface codes described in (Sci. Adv. 6, eaay4929 (2020)). The shuttling schedule needed to implement this gate is only marginally more complex than is required for implementing the standard 2D surface code in this architecture. We compare the resource cost of this operation with the cost of magic state distillation and find that, at present, this comparison is heavily in favour of distillation. The high cost of the non-Clifford gate is almost entirely due to the relatively low performance of the just-in-time decoder used as part of this process, which necessitates very large code distances in order to achieve suitably low logical error rates. We argue that, as very little attention has previously been given to the study and optimisation of these decoders, there are potentially significant improvements to be made in this area.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) which define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a Hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>GroverGPT: A Large Language Model with 8 Billion Parameters for Quantum Searching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting non-Von Neumann paradigm, offering provable speedups over classical computing for specific problems. However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</description>

      <title>The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. This includes the presence of scarring on unstable periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>Effcient classical error correction for parity encoded spin systems</title>

Abstract: Fast solvers for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) have attracted engineering interest in various industrial and social applications. Quantum annealing (QA) has emerged as a promising candidate and significant efforts have been dedicated to its development. Since COP is encoded in the Ising interaction between logical spins, its realization requires a spin system with all-to-all connectivity, which poses technical difficulties in the physical implementation of large-scale QA devices. W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller proposed parity-encoding (PE) architecture, consisting of a larger system of physical spins with only local connectivities between them, to avoid this diffculty in the near future QA device development. They suggested that this architecture not only reduces implementation diffculties and improves scalability, but also has intrinsic fault tolerance because logical spins are redundantly and nonlocally encoded into the physical spins. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how these advantageous features can be exploited. This paper addresses how to correct errors in a spin readout of PE architecture. Our work is based on the close connection between PE architecture and classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We have shown that independent and identically distributed errors in a spin readout can be corrected by a very simple decoding algorithm that can be regarded as a bit flipping (BF) algorithm for the LDPC codes. The BF algorithm was shown to have comparable performance to the belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm. Furthermore, it is suggested that the introduction of post-readout BF decoding reduces the total computational cost and improves the performance of the global optimal solution search using the PE architecture. We believe that our results indicate that the PE architecture is a promising platform for near-term QA devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Frequency Conversion of Ultra-Violet Single Photons from a Trapped Ytterbium Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion trap system is a leading candidate for quantum network privileged by its long coherence time, high-fidelity gate operations, and the ion-photon entanglement that generates an ideal pair of a stationary memory qubit and a flying communication qubit. Rapid developments in nonlinear quantum frequency conversion techniques have enhanced the potential for constructing a trapped ion quantum network via optical fiber connections. The generation of long-distance entanglement has been demonstrated with ions such as Ca$^{+}$ and Ba$^{+}$, which emit photons in visible or near-infrared range naturally. On the other hand, as the qubit-native photons reside in ultra-violet (UV) spectrum, the Yb$^{+}$ ion has not been considered as a strong competitor for telecommunication qubits despite extensive research on it. Here, we demonstrate an efficient difference-frequency conversion of UV photons, emitted from a trapped Yb$^{+}$ ion, into a visible range. We provide experimental evidence that confirms the converted photons are radiated from the Yb$^{+}$ ion. Our results provide a crucial step toward realizing a long-distance trapped ion quantum network based on Yb$^{+}$ ions through quantum frequency conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifying the functional correctness of programs with both classical and quantum constructs is a challenging task. The presence of probabilistic behaviour entailed by quantum measurements and unbounded while loops complicate the verification task greatly. We propose a new quantum Hoare logic for local reasoning about probabilistic behaviour by introducing distribution formulas to specify probabilistic properties. We show that the proof rules in the logic are sound with respect to a denotational semantics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the logic, we formally verify the correctness of non-trivial quantum algorithms including the HHL and Shor's algorithms. Moreover, we embed our logic into the proof assistant Coq. The resulting logical framework, called CoqQLR, can facilitate semi-automated reasoning about classical--quantum programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the impact of light-driven structural changes via nonlinear phononics on the magnetic order of untwisted bilayer van der Waals materials. We consider an illustrative example of the AA-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattice and show that high-intensity light in resonance with selected phonons induces large amplitude phonon displacements that modify the magnetic Hamiltonian of the system. We performed a group theory analysis to identify the vibrational modes of the honeycomb bilayer and the nonlinear couplings among them in the strongly driven regime. We find that the structural changes in the strongly driven regime lower the symmetry relative to the equilibrium lattice and produce changes in the magnetic interactions between the local moments. In particular, the lattice symmetry changes permit a non-zero interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that induces a magnetic state with canted local moments. Using a spin-wave analysis about the new magnetic configuration we study the corresponding changes in the magnon spectrum and identify a protocol for engineering topological band transitions using a combination of nonlinear phononics and an external magnetic field. Our work suggests a strategy to induce and control interlayer Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a class of layered van der Waals materials, the effect of which is to modify the magnetic ground state, magnon dispersions, and related band geometric properties, including topological invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, starting with a simple fermion wave function, the steady mixed state of the evolution of a class of Lindbladians, and the ensemble created by strong local measurement of fermion density without post-selection can be mapped to the "Gutzwiller projected" wave functions in the doubled Hilbert space -- the representation of the density matrix through the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. A Gutzwiller projection is a broadly used approach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a gapless free Dirac fermion pure quantum state, the constructed mixed state corresponds to an algebraic spin liquid in the doubled Hilbert space. We also predict that for some initial fermion wave function, the mixed state created following the procedure described above is expected to have a spontaneous "strong-to-weak" U(1) symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the emergence of superconductivity in the doubled Hilbert space. We also design the experimental protocol to construct the desired physics of mixed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored quantum dynamics of Gaussian mixed states and derive the universal Fokker-Planck equations that govern the stochastic time evolution of entire density-matrix spectra, obtaining their exact solutions. From these equations, we reveal an even-odd effect in purification dynamics: whereas entropy exhibits exponential decay for an even number $N$ of complex fermions, algebraic decay with divergent purification time occurs for odd $N$ as a manifestation of dynamical criticality. Additionally, we identify the universal fluctuations of entropy in the chaotic regime, serving as a non-unitary counterpart of the universal conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic electronic transport phenomena. Furthermore, we elucidate and classify the universality classes of non-unitary quantum dynamics based on fundamental symmetry. We also validate the universality of these analytical results through extensive numerical simulations across different types of models.</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at the magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model, we find Dirac cones centered at only the $K_M$ ($K'_M$) corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone at the $K'$ ($K$) valley deform into rings of exceptional points in the presence of non-Hermiticity, which is different from single-layer graphene with gain and loss, where exceptional rings appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouin zone. We show that the exceptional rings are protected by non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. More interestingly, at an ``exceptional magic angle" larger than the Hermitian magic angle, the exceptional rings coincide and form non-Hermitian flat bands with zero energy and a finite lifetime. These non-Hermitian flat bands in the moir\'e system, which are isolated from dispersive bands, are distinguished from those in non-Hermitian frustrated lattices. In addition, we find that the non-Hermitian flat band has topological charge conserved in the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which is allowed for analogs of non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Flat-band (de)localization emulated with a superconducting qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits are analog quantum simulators able to emulate a wide range of tight-binding models in parameter regimes that are difficult to access or adjust in natural materials. In this work, we use a superconducting qubit array to emulate a tight-binding model on the rhombic lattice, which features flat bands. Enabled by broad adjustability of the dispersion of the energy bands and of on-site disorder, we examine regimes where flat-band localization and Anderson localization compete. We observe disorder-induced localization for dispersive bands and disorder-induced delocalization for flat bands. Remarkably, we find a sudden transition between the two regimes and, in its vicinity, the semblance of quantum critical scaling.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The $S=\frac{1}{2}$ XY and XYZ models on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice do not possess nontrivial local conserved quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <title>A note on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the mean-field Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous mean-field Bose gas at positive temperature. We show that spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking occurs if and only if the system displays Bose-Einstein condensation in the sense that the one-particle density matrix of the Gibbs state has a macroscopic eigenvalue.</description>
