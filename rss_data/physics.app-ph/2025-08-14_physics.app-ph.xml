      <title>ANISSA: Advanced Neutron Imaging for Solid-State batteries in Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of high-energy density solid-state batteries is critical for the achievement of carbon neutrality goals and the advancement of clean energy. Still, the fundamental understanding of lithium transport mechanisms and degradation processes remains limited. Current characterisation methods face significant challenges in studying these complex systems, particularly due to the difficulty of detecting lithium dynamics in three-dimensional battery architectures in operando conditions. Here we present the ANISSA (Advanced Neutron Imaging for Solid-State batteries in Action) project, an integrated experimental framework combining high-resolution neutron and X-ray imaging techniques to research coupled electro-chemo-mechanical processes in lithium-based energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>A Suspended 4H-Silicon Carbide Membrane Platform for Defect Integration into Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4H-silicon carbide is a promising platform for solid-state quantum technology due to its commercial availability as a wide bandgap semiconductor and ability to host numerous spin-active color centers. Integrating color centers into suspended nanodevices enhances defect control and readout--key advances needed to fully harness their potential. However, challenges in developing robust fabrication processes for 4H-SiC thin films--due to the material's chemical and mechanical stability--limit their implementation in quantum applications. Here, we report on a new fabrication approach that first synthesizes suspended thin films from a monolithic platform, then patterns devices. With this technique, we fabricate and characterize structures tailored for defect integration, demonstrating 1D photonic crystal cavities, with and without waveguide interfaces, and lithium niobate on 4H-SiC acoustic cavities. This approach allows for greater fabrication flexibility--supporting high temperature annealing and heterogeneous material platform compatibility--providing a versatile platform for scalable fabrication of 4H-SiC devices for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity Optical Microcavity Acoustic Sensor Covering Free Spectral Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical whispering gallery mode microcavity acoustic sensors have emerged significant potential in high-sensitivity acoustic signal detection, but the narrow dynamic range limits the application prospect. To address the challenge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-sensitivity acoustic sensor in optical whispering gallery mode microcavity. The proposed sensor integrates an extended Mach-Zehnder polarization interferometer with postselection, extending the dynamic range to the free spectral range. The sensing regions can be categorized into phase-drastic and phase-enhanced regions, both of which yield an optimal acoustic response that surpasses traditional transmission method. Experiment results demonstrate improvements of 57.87 dB in detection sensitivity and 26 times in minimal detectable acoustic pressure over the transmission method. Moreover, the application of coherent state and heterodyne detection can enhance response amplitude, further improving the detection sensitivity. Given the wide application range for acoustic dispersion and dissipation response, as well as the performance advantages of high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the proposed WGM sensor offers a promising solution for acoustic sensing. Potentially, the structural design may be adaptable to other application scenarios involving time-varying signals through optical microcavity sensing.</description>

      <title>Compressible boundary layers over isotropic porous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compressible laminar boundary layer developing over an isotropic porous substrate is investigated by asymptotic and numerical methods. The substrate is modeled as an array of cubes. The momentum and enthalpy balance equations are derived by volume averaging. The self-similar solution proposed by Tsiberkin (2018) [Transp. Porous Media 121(1):109-120] for streamwise-growing permeability is extended to include compressibility, heat conduction and a nonlinear drag. The velocity profile shows an inflection point at the free fluid-porous interfacial layer, below which it decreases to zero. A marked reduction of the adiabatic recovery temperature of the fluid and the velocity gradient at the interface is observed for high porosity, large grains and relatively high Mach numbers. The temperature imposed at the bottom of the porous substrate has a negligible influence on the shear stresses.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Simulation and First Prototype Development of a Microwave Plasma System for Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aid of COMSOL multiphysics simulations, a compact microwave plasma reactor operated at 2.45 GHz frequency has been designed for diamond film deposition. The reactor consists of a cylindrical cavity that resonates in the fundamental mode $TM_{01p}$ with a longitudinal field variation (p = 1). Investigations on microwave electric field and hydrogen $(H_{2})$ plasma characteristics inside the microwave plasma cavity have been carried out, which assisted in the resonant cavity optimizations. The new reactor design includes a unique antenna structure which facilitates better thermal management and gas inlet arrangement. Parametric analysis of the effect of increase in microwave power, gas pressure and synergistic effects of power and pressure variations on the $H_{2}$ plasma characteristics such as electron density, gas temperature, and atomic hydrogen density have been performed computationally to estimate the optimize reactor operating conditions. Observations from our simulations indicate that the cavity design is able to operate within a range of microwave power and gas pressure upto $P_{in}=6$ kW and $p_{0}=30$ kPa respectively. Preliminary experimental validation which includes vacuum integrity and $H_{2}$ plasma ignition tests inside the cavity are also reported.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction as a Way to Turn It into a Field-Free Vortex Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous analytical framework for quantitatively evaluating space-based laser power beaming from lunar-orbiting spacecraft to surface receivers, addressing the critical need for continuous, high-density energy to sustain lunar exploration and habitation. The framework integrates physics-based models of spacecraft photovoltaic generation, precise orbital geometries, time-dependent link availability and slant-range variations, coherent beam propagation (including transmitter aperture diameter, beam quality factor, path losses, and pointing jitter), and photonic-to-electrical conversion at the lunar surface. Particular emphasis is placed on phased-array transmitter systems, whose large effective apertures significantly reduce beam divergence relative to single-aperture designs, resulting in orders-of-magnitude increases in delivered surface power under equivalent orbital and power conditions. Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative numerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power density and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances. The study also examines advanced orbital configurations (e.g., Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits, Earth-Moon Lagrange points), real-time adaptive beam steering and wavefront control, optimized receiver geometries, and thermal/dust mitigation strategies. The results establish a clear pathway toward scalable, efficient laser power beaming infrastructures capable of overcoming lunar-specific challenges - including prolonged darkness and permanently shadowed regions - and enabling sustained robotic and crewed surface operations.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Lateral and Vertical Beta-Ga2O3 Photoconductive Switches via Intrinsic and Extrinsic Optical Triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with its ultra-wide bandgap (approximately 4.8 eV) and high breakdown field (approximately 8 MV per cm), is a leading candidate for photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSSs) in high-power and high-speed pulsed applications. This work, for the first time, presents a systematic experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1 and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation, which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3 PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals devices for surface-sensitive experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-operando characterization of van der Waals (vdW) devices using surface-sensitive methods provides critical insights into phase transitions and correlated electronic states. Yet, integrating vdW materials in functional devices while maintaining pristine surfaces is a key challenge for combined transport and surface-sensitive experiments. Conventional lithographic techniques introduce surface contamination, limiting the applicability of state-of-the-art spectroscopic probes. We present a stencil lithography-based approach for fabricating vdW devices, producing micron-scale electrical contacts, and exfoliation in ultra-high vacuum. The resist-free patterning method utilizes a shadow mask to define electrical contacts and yields thin flakes down to the single-layer regime via gold-assisted exfoliation. As a demonstration, we fabricate devices from 1$T-$TaS$_2$ flakes, achieving reliable contacts for application of electrical pulses and resistance measurements, as well as clean surfaces allowing for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The approach provides a platform for studying the electronic properties of vdW systems with surface-sensitive probes in well-defined device geometries.</description>

      <title>Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architected materials that exploit buckling instabilities to reversibly trap energy have been shown to be effective for impact protection. The energy-absorbing capabilities of these architected materials can be enhanced further by incorporating viscoelastic material behavior into the buckling elements using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE). In addition to conventional viscoelastic behavior, LCEs also exhibit a highly dissipative rate-dependent soft stress response from mesogen rotation under a mechanical load. However, the buckling elements cannot take advantage of this dissipation mechanism because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold for mesogen rotation. In this study, we investigate tension-induced soft stress behavior as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of lattice structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus/Standard as a user-defined element to simulate finite-strain behavior of monodomain LCEs, including soft stress response. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. These findings demonstrate a new design strategy for LCE-based architected materials to enhance energy dissipation.</description>
