      <title>Asymptotic behavior of invariants of syzygies of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a complete intersection ring of codimension $c\geq 2$ and dimension $d\geq 1$. Let $M$ be a finitely generated maximal Cohen-Macaulay $A$-module. Set $M_i=\text{Syz}^A_{i}(M)$. Let $e^{\mathfrak{m}}_i(M)$ be the $i$-th Hilbert coefficient of $M$ with respect to $\mathfrak{m}$. We prove for all $i\gg0$, the function $i\mapsto e^{\mathfrak{m}}_j(M_i)$ is a quasi-polynomial type with period $2$ and degree $\text{cx}(M)-1$ for $j=0,1$, where $\text{cx}(M)$ is the complexity of $M.$ For $\text{cx}(M)=2,$ we prove
  $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\dfrac{e^{\mathfrak{m}}_1(M_{2n+j})}{n}\geq \lim_{n\to \infty}\dfrac{e^{\mathfrak{m}}_0(M_{2n+j})}{n}-\lim_{n\to \infty}\dfrac{\mu(M_{2n+j})}{n}$$ for $j=0,1$. When equality holds, we prove that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the associated graded ring of $M_i$ with respect to the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ is bounded for all $i\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>The Multiplicity of Powers of a Class of Non-Square-free Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ be a polynomial ring over a field $\mathbb{K}$, and let $I \subseteq R$ be a monomial ideal of height $h$. We provide a formula for the multiplicity of the powers of $I$ when all the primary ideals of height $h$ in the irredundant minimal primary decomposition of $I$ are irreducible. This is a generalization of \cite[Theorem 1.1]{TV}. Furthermore, we present a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special powers of monomial ideals that satisfy the aforementioned conditions. Here, the $m$-th special power of a monomial ideal refers to the ideal generated by the $m$-th powers of all its minimal generators. Finally, we explicitly provide a formula for the multiplicity of powers of special powers of edge ideals in vertex-weighted oriented graphs using combinatorial properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an example of a division ring $D$ and a maximal left ideal $M$ in the polynomial ring $D[x,y]$ in two central variables over $D$, such that the intersection $M \cap D[x]$ is not a maximal left ideal in $D[x]$. This resolves a ring-theoretic problem of Amitsur and Small raised in 1978.</description>

      <title>Annihilator of local cohomology modules under localization and completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(R, \frak m)$ be a Noetherian local ring. This paper deals with the annihilator of Artinian local cohomology modules $H^i_{\frak m}(M)$ in the relation with the structure of the base ring $R$, for non negative integers $i$ and finitely generated $R$-modules $M$. Firstly, the catenarity and the unmixedness of local rings are characterized via the compatibility of annihilator of top local cohomology modules under localization and completion, respectively. Secondly, some necessary and sufficient conditions for a local ring being a quotient of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring are given in term of the annihilator of all local cohomology modules under localization and completion.</description>

      <title>Gapfree graphs and powers of edge ideals with linear quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a gapfree graph and let $I(G)$ be its edge ideal. An open conjecture of Nevo and Peeva states that $I(G)^q$ has a linear resolution for $q\gg 0$. We investigate a stronger conjecture that if $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for some integer $q$, then $I(G)^{q+1}$ also has linear quotients. We give a partial solution to this conjecture. It is known that if $G$ does not contain a cricket, a diamond, or a $C_4$, then $I(G)^q$ has a linear resolution for $q \geq 2$. We construct a family of gapfree graphs $G$ containing cricket, diamond, $C_4$ and $C_5$ as induced subgraphs of $G$ for which $I(G)^q$ has linear quotients for $q \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Ischebeck's formula, Grade and quasi-homological dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-projective dimension and quasi-injective dimension are recently introduced homological invariants that generalize the classical notions of projective dimension and injective dimension, respectively. For a local ring $R$ and finitely generated $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, we provide conditions involving quasi-homological dimensions where the equality $\sup \lbrace i\geq 0: \operatorname{Ext}_R^i(M,N)\not=0 \rbrace =\operatorname{depth} R-\operatorname{depth} M$, which we call Ischebeck's formula, holds. One of the results in this direction generalizes a well-known result of Ischebeck concerning modules of finite injective dimension, considering the quasi-injective dimension. On the other hand, we establish an inequality relating the quasi-projective dimension of a finitely generated module to its grade and introduce the concept of a quasi-perfect module as a natural generalization of a perfect module. We prove several results for this new concept similar to the classical results. Additionally, we provide a formula for the grade of finitely generated modules with finite quasi-injective dimension over a local ring, as well as grade inequalities for modules of finite quasi-projective dimension. In our study, Cohen-Macaulayness criteria are also obtained.</description>

      <title>When do Ten Points Lie on a Quadric Surface?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A solution is provided to the Bruxelles Problem, a geometric decision problem originally posed in 1825, that asks for a synthetic construction to determine when ten points in 3-space lie on a quadric surface, a surface given by the vanishing of a degree-2 polynomial. The solution constructs four new points that are coplanar precisely when the ten original points lie on a quadric surface. The solution uses only lines constructed through two known points, planes constructed through three known points, and intersections of these objects. The tools involved include an extension of the Area Principle to three-dimensional space, bracket polynomials and the Grassmann-Cayley algebra, and von Staudt's results on geometric arithmetic. Many special cases are treated directly, leading to the generic case, where three pairs of the points generate skew lines and the remaining four points are in general position. A key step in the generic case involves finding a nice basis for the quadrics that pass through six of the ten points, which uses insights derived from Macaulay2, a computational algebra package not available in the nineteenth century.</description>

      <title>Tor Groups of the Stanley-Reisner Ring of a Matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Tor groups $ \mathop{Tor}_{\bullet}^{S_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ}} \left( \mathbb{C}[\Sigma_{\mathrm{M}}], \mathbb{C} \right)_{\bullet} $ for a loopless matroid $\mathrm{M}$ as a way to study the extra relations occurring in the linear ideal of the Feichtner-Yuzvinsky presentation of the Chow ring $ A^{\bullet}(\mathrm{M}) $. This extends the definition of the Chow ring of a matroid since $ \mathop{Tor}_{0}^{S_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ}} \left( \mathbb{C}[\Sigma_{\mathrm{M}}], \mathbb{C} \right)_{\bullet} \cong A^{\bullet}(\mathrm{M}) $. Our main tool in studying these groups is to recognize them as cohomology of the toric variety associated to the Bergman fan of the matroid. With this geometric approach, we show that these Tor groups fit into a long exact sequence arising from the matroidal flips of Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz, extending the short exact sequence in the case of Chow rings. Using this long exact sequence we give a recursive formula for the Hilbert series of the Tor algebra of a uniform matroid.</description>

Abstract: We study some permanence properties of the relative $F$-rational signature defined and studied by Smirnov--Tucker. We show that this invariant is compatible with the gamma-construction, and then derive other main results from the $F$-finite case established by Smirnov--Tucker. We also obtain limited results about the $F$-rational signature defined and studied by Hochster--Yao. We explore some features of the gamma-construction along the way, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $F$-pure threshold of some non-principal ideals which satisfy a geometric generic condition about their Newton polyhedron. We also contribute some evidence in favor of the conjectured equality between the $F$-pure threshold and the log canonical threshold of ideals for infinitely many primes $p$. These results are obtained by generalizing the theory of splitting polytopes to the case of ideals. As an application of our results we obtain geometric lower bounds for the recently introduced $F$-volume of a collection of ideals.</description>

Abstract: A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is a virtually Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex if its associated Stanley-Reisner ring $S$ has a virtual resolution, as defined by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith, of length ${\rm codim}(S)$. We provide a sufficient condition on $\Delta$ to be a virtually Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex. We also introduce virtually shellable simplicial complexes, a generalization of shellable simplicial complexes. Virtually shellable complexes have the property that they are virtually Cohen-Macaulay, generalizing the well-known fact that shellable simplicial complexes are Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Topological closure of formal power series ideals and application to topological rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate formal power series ideals and their relationship to topological rewriting theory. Since commutative formal power series algebras are Zariski rings, their ideals are closed for the adic topology defined by the maximal ideal generated by the indeterminates. We provide a constructive proof of this result which, given a formal power series in the topological closure of an ideal, consists in computing a cofactor representation of the series with respect to a standard basis of the ideal. We apply this result in the context of topological rewriting theory, where two natural notions of confluence arise: topological confluence and infinitary confluence. We give explicit examples illustrating that in general, infinitary confluence is a strictly stronger notion than topological confluence. Using topological closure of ideals, we finally show that in the context of rewriting theory on commutative formal power series, infinitary and topological confluences are equivalent when the monomial order considered is compatible with the degree.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A=\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb N}A_i$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. Under the assumptions that $A$ is ring-indecomposable and $A_0$ has finite global dimension, we show that the stable category $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ always admits an (explicitly constructed) silting object. We also show that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter $p^A_\mathrm{av} \in {\mathbb Q}$ of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^\mathrm{b}(\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B)$ of a smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurface $\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</description>
