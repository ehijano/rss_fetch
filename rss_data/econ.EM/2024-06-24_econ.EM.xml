      <title>MIDAS-QR with 2-Dimensional Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed frequency data has been shown to improve the performance of growth-at-risk models in the literature. Most of the research has focused on imposing structure on the high-frequency lags when estimating MIDAS-QR models akin to what is done in mean models. However, only imposing structure on the lag-dimension can potentially induce quantile variation that would otherwise not be there. In this paper we extend the framework by introducing structure on both the lag dimension and the quantile dimension. In this way we are able to shrink unnecessary quantile variation in the high-frequency variables. This leads to more gradual lag profiles in both dimensions compared to the MIDAS-QR and UMIDAS-QR. We show that this proposed method leads to further gains in nowcasting and forecasting on a pseudo-out-of-sample exercise on US data.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Time-Varying Covariates in the Parallel Trends Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study difference-in-differences identification and estimation strategies where the parallel trends assumption holds after conditioning on time-varying covariates and/or time-invariant covariates. Our first main contribution is to point out a number of weaknesses of commonly used two-way fixed effects (TWFE) regressions in this context. In addition to issues related to multiple periods and variation in treatment timing that have been emphasized in the literature, we show that, even in the case with only two time periods, TWFE regressions are not generally robust to (i) paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on the level of time-varying covariates (as opposed to only the change in the covariates over time), (ii) paths of untreated potential outcomes depending on time-invariant covariates, and (iii) violations of linearity conditions for outcomes over time and/or the propensity score. Even in cases where none of the previous three issues hold, we show that TWFE regressions can suffer from negative weighting and weight-reversal issues. Thus, TWFE regressions can deliver misleading estimates of causal effect parameters in a number of empirically relevant cases. Second, we extend these arguments to the case of multiple periods and variation in treatment timing. Third, we provide simple diagnostics for assessing the extent of misspecification bias arising due to TWFE regressions. Finally, we propose alternative (and simple) estimation strategies that can circumvent these issues with two-way fixed regressions.</description>

      <title>The disruption index suffers from citation inflation and is confounded by shifts in scholarly citation practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the rate of innovation in academia and industry is fundamental to monitoring the efficiency and competitiveness of the knowledge economy. To this end, a disruption index (CD) was recently developed and applied to publication and patent citation networks (Wu et al., Nature 2019; Park et al., Nature 2023). Here we show that CD systematically decreases over time due to secular growth in research and patent production, following two distinct mechanisms unrelated to innovation -- one behavioral and the other structural. Whereas the behavioral explanation reflects shifts associated with techno-social factors (e.g. self-citation practices), the structural explanation follows from `citation inflation' (CI), an inextricable feature of real citation networks attributable to increasing reference list lengths, which causes CD to systematically decrease. We demonstrate this causal link by way of mathematical deduction, computational simulation, multi-variate regression, and quasi-experimental comparison of the disruptiveness of PNAS versus PNAS Plus articles, which differ only in their lengths. Accordingly, we analyze CD data available in the SciSciNet database and find that disruptiveness incrementally increased from 2005-2015, and that the negative relationship between disruption and team-size is remarkably small in overall magnitude effect size, and shifts from negative to positive for team size $\geq$ 8 coauthors.</description>

      <title>Contamination Bias in Linear Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05024v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study regressions with multiple treatments and a set of controls that is flexible enough to purge omitted variable bias. We show that these regressions generally fail to estimate convex averages of heterogeneous treatment effects -- instead, estimates of each treatment's effect are contaminated by non-convex averages of the effects of other treatments. We discuss three estimation approaches that avoid such contamination bias, including the targeting of easiest-to-estimate weighted average effects. A re-analysis of nine empirical applications finds economically and statistically meaningful contamination bias in observational studies; contamination bias in experimental studies is more limited due to smaller variability in propensity scores.</description>

      <title>Distributional Effects with Two-Sided Measurement Error: An Application to Intergenerational Income Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers identification and estimation of distributional effect parameters that depend on the joint distribution of an outcome and another variable of interest ("treatment") in a setting with "two-sided" measurement error -- that is, where both variables are possibly measured with error. Examples of these parameters in the context of intergenerational income mobility include transition matrices, rank-rank correlations, and the poverty rate of children as a function of their parents' income, among others. Building on recent work on quantile regression (QR) with measurement error in the outcome (particularly, Hausman, Liu, Luo, and Palmer (2021)), we show that, given (i) two linear QR models separately for the outcome and treatment conditional on other observed covariates and (ii) assumptions about the measurement error for each variable, one can recover the joint distribution of the outcome and the treatment. Besides these conditions, our approach does not require an instrument, repeated measurements, or distributional assumptions about the measurement error. Using recent data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Study of Youth, we find that accounting for measurement error notably reduces several estimates of intergenerational mobility parameters.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage Methods for Treatment Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the problem of determining whether to treat individuals based on observed covariates. The most common decision rule is the conditional empirical success (CES) rule proposed by Manski (2004), which assigns individuals to treatments that yield the best experimental outcomes conditional on the observed covariates. Conversely, using shrinkage estimators, which shrink unbiased but noisy preliminary estimates toward the average of these estimates, is a common approach in statistical estimation problems because it is well-known that shrinkage estimators have smaller mean squared errors than unshrunk estimators. Inspired by this idea, we propose a computationally tractable shrinkage rule that selects the shrinkage factor by minimizing the upper bound of the maximum regret. Then, we compare the maximum regret of the proposed shrinkage rule with that of CES and pooling rules when the parameter space is correctly specified or misspecified. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the shrinkage rule performs well in many cases and these findings are further supported by numerical experiments. Specifically, we show that the maximum regret of the shrinkage rule can be strictly smaller than that of the CES and pooling rules in certain cases when the parameter space is correctly specified. In addition, we find that the shrinkage rule is robust against misspecifications of the parameter space. Finally, we apply our method to experimental data from the National Job Training Partnership Act Study.</description>

      <title>Interpreting TSLS Estimators in Information Provision Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To estimate the causal effects of beliefs on actions, researchers often run information provision experiments. We consider the causal interpretation of two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimators in these experiments. We characterize common TSLS estimators as weighted averages of causal effects, and interpret these weights under general belief updating conditions that nest parametric models from the literature. Our framework accommodates TSLS estimators for both passive and active control designs. Notably, we find that some passive control estimators allow for negative weights, which compromises their causal interpretation. We give practical guidance on such issues, and illustrate our results in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference on Treatment Effects under Covariate-Adaptive Randomization and Imperfect Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) frequently utilize covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR) (e.g., stratified block randomization) and commonly suffer from imperfect compliance. This paper studies the identification and inference for the average treatment effect (ATE) and the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in such RCTs with a binary treatment.
  We first develop characterizations of the identified sets for both estimands. Since data are generally not i.i.d. under CAR, these characterizations do not follow from existing results. We then provide consistent estimators of the identified sets and asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the parameters. Our asymptotic analysis leads to concrete practical recommendations regarding how to estimate the treatment assignment probabilities that enter in estimated bounds. In the case of the ATE, using sample analog assignment frequencies is more efficient than using the true assignment probabilities. On the contrary, using the true assignment probabilities is preferable for the ATT.</description>
