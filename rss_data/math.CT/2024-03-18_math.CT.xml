      <title>Introductory notes on real-enriched categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-enriched categories are categories with real numbers as enrichment. Precisely, a real-enriched category is a category enriched over the commutative and unital quantale composed of the unit interval and a continuous t-norm. These notes present a brief introduction to real-enriched categories, focusing on the presheaf monad and its submonads in the category of such categories.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>

      <title>A Graded Schur Lemma and a graded-monoidal structure for induced modules over graded-commutative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider algebras and Frobenius algebras, internal to a monoidal category, that are graded over a finite abelian group. For the case that A is a twisted group algebra in a linear abelian monoidal category we obtain a graded generalization of the Schur Lemma for the category of induced A-modules. We further show that if the monoidal category is braided and A is commutative up to a bicharacter of the grading group, then the category of induced A-modules can be endowed with a graded-monoidal structure that is twisted by the bicharacter. In the particular case that the grading group is Z/2Z, these findings reproduce known results about superalgebras and super-monoidal structures.</description>

      <title>Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. We interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>

      <title>Functors induced by comma categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of category theory is to provide a collective description of many arrangements in mathematics, such as topological spaces, Banach spaces and game theory. Within this collective description, the perspective from any individual member of the collection is provided by its associated left or right slice. The assignment of slices to objects extends to a functor from the base category, into the category of categories. We extend this observation to a more general situation of two categories $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ mapping into a third category $\mathcal{C}$, via functors $F,G$. Such arrangements abound in mathematics \cite{Lawvere1963semantics}, and are studied via the comma category $\left[ F; G\right]$. Objects in this category are morphisms between objects of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, via the functors $F,G$. We show that these objects also have a natural interpretation as functors between slice categories of $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. Thus even though $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ may have completely disparate structures, some functors between their slices can be interpreted as morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of standard Borel spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category $\mathsf{SBor}$ of standard Borel spaces is the (bi-)initial object in the 2-category of countably complete Boolean (countably) extensive categories. This means that $\mathsf{SBor}$ is the universal category admitting some familiar algebraic operations of countable arity (e.g., countable products, unions) obeying some simple compatibility conditions (e.g., products distribute over disjoint unions). More generally, for any infinite regular cardinal $\kappa$, the dual of the category $\kappa\mathsf{Bool}_\kappa$ of $\kappa$-presented $\kappa$-complete Boolean algebras is (bi-)initial in the 2-category of $\kappa$-complete Boolean ($\kappa$-)extensive categories.</description>

      <title>Structural, point-free, non-Hausdorff topological realization of Borel groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Becker--Kechris topological realization and change-of-topology theorems for Polish group actions in several directions. For Polish group actions, we prove a single result that implies the original Becker--Kechris theorems, as well as Sami's and Hjorth's sharpenings adapted levelwise to the Borel hierarchy; automatic continuity of Borel actions via homeomorphisms; and the equivalence of "potentially open" versus "orbitwise open" Borel sets. We also characterize "potentially open" $n$-ary relations, thus yielding a topological realization theorem for invariant Borel first-order structures. We then generalize to groupoid actions, and prove a result subsuming Lupini's Becker--Kechris-type theorems for open Polish groupoids, newly adapted to the Borel hierarchy, as well as topological realizations of actions on fiberwise topological bundles and bundles of first-order structures.
  Our proof method is new even in the classical case of Polish groups, and is based entirely on formal algebraic properties of category quantifiers; in particular, we make no use of either metrizability or the strong Choquet game. Consequently, our proofs work equally well in the non-Hausdorff context, for open quasi-Polish groupoids, and more generally in the point-free context, for open localic groupoids.</description>
