      <title>Ultrafast Vibrational Control of Hybrid Perovskite Devices Reveals the Influence of the Organic Cation on Electronic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational control (VC) of photochemistry through the optical stimulation of structural dynamics is a nascent concept only recently demonstrated for model molecules in solution. Extending VC to state-of-the-art materials may lead to new applications and improved performance for optoelectronic devices. Metal halide perovskites are promising targets for VC due to their mechanical softness and the rich array of vibrational motions of both their inorganic and organic sublattices. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast VC of FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells via intramolecular vibrations of the formamidinium cation using spectroscopic techniques based on vibrationally promoted electronic resonance. The observed short (~300 fs) time window of VC highlights the fast dynamics of coupling between the cation and inorganic sublattice. First-principles modelling reveals that this coupling is mediated by hydrogen bonds that modulate both lead halide lattice and electronic states. Cation dynamics modulating this coupling may suppress non-radiative recombination in perovskites, leading to photovoltaics with reduced voltage losses.</description>

      <title>Influence of chemical interactions on the electronic properties of BiOI/organic semiconductor heterojunctions for application in solution-processed electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth oxide iodide (BiOI) has been viewed as a suitable environmentally-friendly alternative to lead-halide perovskites for low-cost (opto-)electronic applications such as photodetectors, phototransistors and sensors. To enable its incorporation in these devices in a convenient, scalable, and economical way, BiOI thin films were investigated as part of heterojunctions with various p-type organic semiconductors (OSCs) and tested in a field-effect transistor (FET) configuration. The hybrid heterojunctions, which combine the respective functionalities of BiOI and the OSCs were processed from solution under ambient atmosphere. The characteristics of each of these hybrid systems were correlated with the physical and chemical properties of the respective materials using a concept based on heteropolar chemical interactions at the interface. Systems suitable for application in lateral transport devices were identified and it was demonstrated how materials in the hybrids interact to provide improved and synergistic properties. These indentified heterojunction FETs are a first instance of successful incorporation of solution-processed BiOI thin films in a three-terminal device. They show a significant threshold voltage shift and retained carrier mobility compared to pristine OSC devices and open up possibilities for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Cobalt-based Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co Metallic Heterostructure as a Highly Active Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkaline water electrolysis is considered a commercially viable option for large-scale hydrogen production. However, this process still faces challenges due to the high voltage (&gt;1.65 V at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$) and its limited stability at higher current densities due to the inefficient electron transport kinetics. Herein, a novel cobalt based metallic heterostructure (Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co/Co) is designed for application for water electrolysis. Operando Raman experiments reveal that the formation of Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co heterointerface boosts the free water adsorption and dissociation, resulting in a surplus of protons available for subsequent hydrogen production. Furthermore, the altered electronic structure of Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co heterointerface optimizes the {\Delta}GH of nitrogen atoms at the interface. This synergistic effect between interfacial nitrogen atoms and metal phase cobalt creates highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) active sites, thereby enhancing the overall performance. Additionally, the heterostructure exhibits a rapid OH- adsorption rate, coupled with a strong adsorption strength, leading to improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Crucially, the metallic heterojunction facilitates fast electron transport, expediting the aforementioned reaction steps and ultimately improving the overall efficiency of water splitting. The water electrolyzer with Co$_3$Mo3N/Co$_4$N/Co/Co as a catalyst exhibits outstanding performance, requiring an impressively low cell voltage of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ and maintaining approximately 100% retention over a remarkable 100 h duration at 200 mA cm$^{-2}$. This performance significantly exceeds that of the commercial Pt/C || RuO2 electrolyzer.</description>

      <title>Physical Vapor Deposition of High Mobility P-type Tellurium and its Applications for Gate-tunable van der Waals PN Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently tellurium (Te) has attracted resurgent interests due to its p-type characteristics and outstanding ambient environmental stability. Here we present a substrate engineering based physical vapor deposition method to synthesize high-quality Te nanoflakes and achieved a field-effect hole mobility of 1500 cm2/Vs, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest among the existing synthesized van der Waals p-type semiconductors. The high mobility Te enables the fabrication of Te/MoS2 pn diodes with highly gate-tunable electronic and optoelectronic characteristics. The Te/MoS2 heterostructure can be used as a visible range photodetector with a current responsivity up to 630 A/W, which is about one order of magnitude higher than the one achieved using p-type Si-MoS2 PN photodiodes. The photo response of the Te/MoS2 heterojunction also exhibits strong gate tunability due to their ultrathin thickness and unique band structures. The successful synthesis of high mobility Te and the enabled Te/MoS2 photodiodes show promise for the development of highly tunable and ultrathin photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Enabling Experimental Impulse-Based Substructuring through Time Domain Deconvolution and Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic substructuring, especially the frequency-based variant (FBS) using frequency response functions (FRF), is gaining in popularity and importance, with countless successful applications, both numerically and experimentally. One drawback, however, is found when the responses to shocks are determined. Numerically, this might be especially expensive when a huge number of high-frequency modes have to be accounted for to correctly predict response amplitudes to shocks. In all cases, the initial response predicted using frequency-based substructuring might be erroneous, due to the forced periodization of the Fourier transform. This drawback can be eliminated by completely avoiding the frequency domain and remaining in the time domain, using the impulse-based substructuring method (IBS), which utilizes impulse response functions (IRF). While this method has already been utilized successfully for numerical test cases, none of the attempted experimental applications were successful. In this paper, an experimental application of IBS to rods considered as one-dimensional is tested in the context of shock analysis, with the goal of correctly predicting the maximum driving point response peak. The challenges related to experimental IBS applications are discussed and an improvement attempt is made by limiting the frequency content considered through low-pass filtering and downsampling. The combination of a purely time domain based estimation procedure for the IRFs and the application of low-pass filtering with downsampling to the measured responses enabled a correct prediction of the initial shock responses of the rods with IBS experimentally, using displacements, velocities and accelerations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of polymer composites in industry asks for the creation of better, faster and cost-effective methods to detect the damage state of such materials. This work presents the investigation of the phase decay , $\Delta{\Phi}$, as a new parameter to characterise crack growth in composites materials utilising an experimental framework of High Frequency Fatigue Testing (HFFT), a framework where the excitation occurs at vibration resonance. The proposed methodology empirically relates the crack growth measurements, from interrupted testing, with the structural phase decay response, distinctive of material strength degradation</description>

      <title>High-order harmonic generation from laser induced plasma comprising CdSe/V2O5 Core/Shell quantum dots embedded on MoS2 nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research of the nonlinear optical characteristics of transition metal dichalcogenides in the presence of photoactive particles, plasmonic nanocavities, waveguides, and metamaterials is still in its early stages. This investigation delves into the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from laser induced plasma of MoS2 nanosheets in the presence of semiconductor photoactive medium such as CdSe and CdSe/V2O5 core/shell quantum dots. Our comprehensive findings shed light on the counteractive coupling impact of both bare and passivated quantum dots on MoS2 nanosheets, as evidenced by the emission of higher-order harmonics. Significantly, the intensity of harmonics and their cut-off were notably enhanced in the MoS2-CdSe and MoS2-V-CdSe configurations compared to pristine MoS2 nanosheets. These advancements hold promise for applications requiring the emission of coherent short-wavelength radiation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Theoretical Limits of Efficiency in Multilayer Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic materials are recognized for their potential as sustainable energy sources that enable the conversion between light and electrical energy. However, solar cells have been unable to surpass the theoretical limit of 32%, known as the Shockley-Queisser limit, and face challenges in effectively utilizing the broad spectrum of sunlight. To address this issue, extensive research is being conducted on multi-junction solar cells, which employ a layered structure comprising materials with varying bandgaps to more effectively harness the wide spectrum of sunlight. This study calculates the theoretical limit of these multi-junction solar cells and identifies optimal bandgap combinations, exploring new possibilities for photovoltaic devices and suggesting directions for technological advancement. This research presents new opportunities beyond the limitations of current solar cell technology and is expected to contribute to enhancing the economic viability and practicality of solar power as a sustainable energy source.</description>

      <title>Cation exchange synthesis of AgBiS$_2$ quantum dots for highly efficient solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silver bismuth sulfide (AgBiS$_2$) nanocrystals have emerged as a promising eco-friendly, low-cost solar cell absorber material. Their direct synthesis often relies on the hot-injection method, requiring the application of high temperatures and vacuum for prolonged times. Here, we demonstrate an alternative synthetic approach via a cation exchange reaction. In the first-step, bis(stearoyl)sulfide is used as an air-stable sulfur precursor for the synthesis of small, monodisperse Ag2S nanocrystals at room-temperature. In a second step, bismuth cations are incorporated into the nanocrystal lattice to form ternary AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals, without altering their size and shape. When implemented into photovoltaic devices, AgBiS$_2$ nanocrystals obtained by cation exchange reach power conversion efficiencies of up to 7.35%, demonstrating the efficacy of the new synthetic approach for the formation of high-quality, ternary semiconducting nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Investigating the missing wedge problem in small-angle x-ray scattering tensor tomography across real and reciprocal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-angle scattering tensor tomography is a technique for studying anisotropic nanostructures of millimeter-sized samples in a volume-resolved manner. It requires the acquisition of data through repeated tomographic rotations about an axis which is subjected to a series of tilts. The tilt that can be achieved with a typical setup is geometrically constrained, which leads to limits in the set of directions from which the different parts of the reciprocal-space map can be probed. Here, we characterize the impact of this limitation on reconstructions in terms of the missing wedge problem of tomography, by treating the problem of tensor tomography as the reconstruction of a three-dimensional field of functions on the unit sphere, represented by a grid of Gaussian radial basis functions. We then devise an acquisition scheme to obtain complete data by remounting the sample, which we apply to a sample of human trabecular bone. Performing tensor tomographic reconstructions of limited data sets as well as the complete data set, we further investigate and validate the missing wedge understanding of data incompleteness by investigating reconstruction errors due to data incompleteness across both real and reciprocal space. Finally, we carry out an analysis of orientations and derived scalar quantities, to quantify the impact of this missing wedge problem on a typical tensor tomographic analysis. We conclude that the effects of data incompleteness are consistent with the predicted impact of the missing wedge problem, and that the impact on tensor tomographic analysis is appreciable but limited, especially if precautions are taken. In particular, there is only limited impact on the means and relative anisotropies of the reconstructed reciprocal space maps.</description>

      <title>Effect of structural parameters on the synchronization characteristics in a stall-induced aeroelastic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on discerning the role of structural parameters on the bifurcation characteristics and the underlying synchronization mechanism in an aeroelastic system undergoing nonlinear stall behaviour. To that end, wind tunnel experiments are performed on a NACA 0012 airfoil capable of undergoing bending (plunging) and torsional (pitching) oscillations under scenarios involving nonlinear aerodynamic loads, i.e., dynamic stall conditions. Flow conditions under both deterministic/sterile flows and fluctuating/stochastic flows are fostered. The structure possesses continuous or polynomial-type stiffness nonlinearities, and therefore, is an aeroelastic experiment involving both structural and aerodynamic nonlinearities. We discern the bifurcation routes for a range of key structural parameters such as frequency ratio, static imbalance, and the extent of structural nonlinearity. In addition to interesting and atypical routes to stall-induced instabilities, we systematically demonstrate the role of modal interactions - via a synchronization analysis - over the manifestation of these instabilities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is perhaps the first study to document the role of multiple structural parameters on a stall-induced aeroelastic system, and in turn, cast the physical mechanism behind these dynamical transitions from the vantage of synchronization.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed in static condition would be inaccurate. The coil constants are determined in a two-step procedure. Considering the presence of a static and of a time-dependent field, firstly, the static one is oriented perpendicularly to the polarization plane of a time dependent one; secondly, the polarization of the latter is made accurately circular. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow the time-dependent field.</description>

      <title>A Non-staggered Projection Algorithm for Two-Phase Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulation Using the Phase-Field/Immersed-Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Pressure-Oscillation-Free projection algorithm for large-density-ratio multiphase fluid-structure interaction simulations, implemented on a non-staggered Cartesian grid. The incompressible Navier-Stokes is decoupled with an improved five-step incremental pressure correction algorithm. Fluid-fluid interface is captured using the Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the surface tension model is coupled with a momentum-weighted interpolation scheme to suppress unphysical pressure oscillations, ensuring accurate evolution of multiphase interfaces. Interaction at the fluid-structure interface is obtained by implicitly solving for the feedback acceleration in the Eulerian-Lagrangian system. For validation of the present method, the comparison studies for Pressure-Oscillation-Free effect are systematically conducted using lid driving cavity and droplet deformation cases. Moreover, several challenging multiphase simulations are implemented and discussed. As a demonstrating example of fluid-structure interaction, a rising bubble bypassing an obstacle is tested.</description>

      <title>Pure skin effect obeying power partition in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has received great attention recently. In particular, band structures in non-Hermitian systems can be engineered to exhibit various topological effects. Among them, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we investigate NHSE in systems featuring directed chains or directed graphs, where the arrows denote the directions of the non-reciprocal hopping between neighbouring nodes. We show that the systems exhibit pure skin modes with non-oscillatory wavefunctions, in contrast to previously studied NHSE. Interestingly, the sum of the decay constants along different directions for each skin mode obeys a power partition rule, i.e. their sum is a fixed value and the value of each constant only depends on the ratio between the non-reciprocal hopping parameters and is independent of detailed graph configurations. Such Pure Skin Effect (PSE) can be explained by using a generalized method for solving the Generalized Brillouin-zone with multiple bulk states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a general quantitative framework to evaluate the quality, track the historical development, and guide future optimization of photovoltaic (PV) absorbers at any development level, including both experimentally synthesized and computer-simulated materials. The framework is based on a PV figure of merit designed to include efficiency limitations due to imperfect photocarrier collection that are not included in classic detailed balance methods. Figure-of-merit-driven efficiency limits including collection losses are calculated for 28 experimentally synthesized PV absorbers and 9 PV absorbers simulated by electronic structure methods. Among emerging absorbers for which no working solar cells have yet been reported, there are very large differences in their likelihood to achieve high PV efficiencies.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for the advanced photocatalytic active materials. These porous crystalline compounds have large active surface area and structural tunability, highly competitive with oxides, the well-established material class for the photocatalysis. However, due to their complex organic and coordination chemistry composition, photophysical mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process in MOFs are still not well understood. Employing electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we investigate the fundamental processes of electron and hole generation, as well as capture events that lead to the formation of various radical species in UiO-66, an archetypical MOF photocatalyst. As a result, we detected a manifold of photoinduced electron spin centers, which we subsequently analyzed and identified with the help of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the photo-induced charge transfer processes, which are the basis of photocatalytic activity in UiO-66. This sets the stage for further studies on photogenerated spin centers in this and similar MOF materials.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Motion of 2D exciton in momentum space leads to pseudospin distribution narrowing on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motional narrowing implies narrowing induced by motion, for example, in nuclear resonance, the thermally induced random motion of the nuclei in an inhomogeneous environment leads to counter-intuitive narrowing of the resonance line. Similarly, the excitons in monolayer semiconductors experience magnetic inhomogeneity: the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction manifests as an in-plane pseudo-magnetic field with a periodically varying orientation inside the exciton band. The excitons undergo random momentum scattering and pseudospin precession repeatedly in this inhomogeneous magnetic environment - typically resulting in fast exciton depolarization. On the contrary, we show that such magnetic inhomogeneity averages out at high scattering rate due to motional narrowing. Physically, a faster exciton scattering leads to a narrower pseudospin distribution on the Bloch sphere, implying a nontrivial improvement in exciton polarization. The in-plane nature of the pseudo-magnetic field enforces a contrasting scattering dependence between the circularly and linearly polarized excitons - providing a spectroscopic way to gauge the sample quality.</description>

      <title>The effect of iron layer thickness on the interlayer exchange coupling in Fe/MgO (001) superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the effect of the Fe layer thickness on the antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling in [Fe/MgO]$_N$ superlattices. An increase in coupling strength with increasing Fe layer thickness is observed, which highlights the need of including the extension of both the layers when discussing the interlayer exchange coupling in superlattices.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic approximation in neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00486v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and explain the quasistatic approximation (QSA) as applied to field modeling for electrical and magnetic stimulation. Neuromodulation analysis pipelines include discrete stages, and QSA is applied specifically when calculating the electric and magnetic fields generated in tissues by a given stimulation dose. QSA simplifies the modeling equations to support tractable analysis, enhanced understanding, and computational efficiency. The application of QSA in neuro-modulation is based on four underlying assumptions: (A1) no wave propagation or self-induction in tissue, (A2) linear tissue properties, (A3) purely resistive tissue, and (A4) non-dispersive tissue. As a consequence of these assumptions, each tissue is assigned a fixed conductivity, and the simplified equations (e.g., Laplace's equation) are solved for the spatial distribution of the field, which is separated from the field's temporal waveform. Recognizing that electrical tissue properties may be more complex, we explain how QSA can be embedded in parallel or iterative pipelines to model frequency dependence or nonlinearity of conductivity. We survey the history and validity of QSA across specific applications, such as microstimulation, deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise definition and explanation of QSA in neuromodulation are essential for rigor when using QSA models or testing their limits.</description>
