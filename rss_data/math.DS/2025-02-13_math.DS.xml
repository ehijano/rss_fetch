      <title>Topological stability of semigroup actions and shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every expansive continuous monoid action on a compact Hausdorff space which has the shadowing property is topologically stable and that a subshift with finite alphabet over a monoid has the shadowing property if and only if it is of finite type. This extends results previously obtained by Walters, Chung and Lee, Meyerovitch, and Oprocha for continuous actions of countable groups on compact metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Time change rigidity for unipotent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a dichotomy regarding the behavior of one-parameter unipotent flows on quotients of semisimple lie groups under time change. We show that if $u^{(1)}_t$ acting on $\mathbf{G}_{1}/\Gamma_1$ is such a flow it satisfies exactly one of the following:
  (1) The flow is loosely Kronecker, and hence measurably isomorphic after an appropriate time change to any other loosely Kronecker system.
  (2) The flow exhibits the following rigid behavior: if the one-parameter unipotent flow $u^{(1)} _ t$ on $\mathbf{G}_1/\Gamma_1$ is measurably isomorphic after time change to another such flow $u^{(2)} _ t$ on $\mathbf{G}_2/\Gamma _ 2$, then $\mathbf{G}_1/\Gamma_1 $ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{G}_2/ \Gamma_2$ with the isomorphism taking $u^{(1)}_t$ to $u^{(2)}_t$ and moreover the time change is cohomologous to a trivial one up to a renormalization.</description>

      <title>Unbounded dynamics for vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a three-dimensional vector field $F$ which generates a finite number of fixed points - what can we say on its unbounded dynamics? In this paper we tackle this question, and prove sufficient conditions for $F$ to have fixed points with unbounded invariant manifolds. Following that, we use these results to study the dynamics of the Genesio-Tesi system, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, and the Michelson system.</description>

      <title>Shadowing for Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend some results about Shadowing Lemma there are known on finite dimensional compact manifolds without border and $\mathbb{R}^n$, to an infinite dimensional space. In fact, we prove that if $\{\mathcal{T}(t):t\ge 0\}$ is a Morse-Smale semigroup defined in a Hilbert space with global attractor $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{T}(1)|_{\mathcal{A}}:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{A} $ admits the Lipschitz Shadowing property. Moreover, for any positively invariant bounded neighborhood $\mathcal{U}\supset\mathcal{A}$ of the global attractor, the map $\mathcal{T}(1)|_{\mathcal{U}}:\mathcal{U}\to \mathcal{U}$ has the H\"{o}lder-Shadowing property. As applications, we obtain new results related to the structural stability of Morse-Smale semigroups defined in Hilbert spaces and continuity of global attractors.</description>

      <title>Stability of N-front and N-back solutions in the Barkley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish for an intermediate Reynolds number domain the stability of N-front and N-back solutions for each N &gt; 1 corresponding to traveling waves, in an experimentally validated model for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow proposed in [Barkley et al., Nature 526(7574):550-553, 2015]. We base our work on the existence analysis of a heteroclinic loop between a turbulent and a laminar equilibrium proved by Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022], as well as some results from this work. The stability proof follows the verification of a set of abstract stability hypotheses stated by Sandstede in [SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 29.1 (1998), pp. 183-207] for traveling waves motivated by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. In particular, this completes the first detailed analysis of Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022] leading to a complete existence and stability statement that nicely fits within the abstract framework of waves generated by twisted heteroclinic loops.</description>

      <title>AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15020v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem. Our code will be released at https: //github.com/zblasingame/AdjointDEIS.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of approaching real numbers with rational numbers with prime denominator and with a single numerator allowed for each denominator. We obtain basic results, both probabilistic and deterministic, draw connections to twisted diophantine approximation, and present a simple application, related to possible correlations between trace functions and dynamical sequences.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of partial coverings defined from closed geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite volume hyperbolic surface, a fundamental polygon and an oriented closed geodesic, we associate a partial covering of the surface. We prove that given a sequence of collections of oriented closed geodesics equidistributing in the unit tangent bundle then the associated partial coverings also equidistribute. In the case of the modular group, this yields an alternative proof of an equidistribution result due to Duke, Imamo\={g}lu, and T\'{o}th.</description>

      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the internet of things, which also extend to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>On the inverse stability of $z^n+c.$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field and $\phi(z)\in K[z]$ be a polynomial. Define $\Phi(z) := \frac{1}{\phi(z)} \in K(z).$ For $n \in\mathbb{N}^* $, let the $n$-th iterate of $\Phi(z)$ be defined as $\Phi^{(n)}(z) = \underbrace{\Phi \circ \Phi \circ \cdots \circ \Phi}_{n \text{ times}}(z).$ We express the \(\Phi^{(n)}(z)\) in its reduced form as \( \Phi^{(n)}(z) = \frac{f_{n,\phi}(z)}{g_{n,\phi}(z)}, \) where \(f_{n,\phi}(z)\) and \(g_{n,\phi}(z)\) are coprime polynomials in \(K[z]\).
  A polynomial $\phi(z) \in K[z]$ is called inversely stable over $K$ if every $g_{n,\phi}(z)$ in the sequence $\{g_{n,\phi}(z)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is irreducible in $K[z]$. This paper investigates the inverse stability of the binomials $\phi(z) = z^d + c$ over $K$.</description>

Abstract: We study the main open parts of the Kawaguchi--Silverman Conjecture, asserting that for a birational self-map $f$ of a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, the arithmetic degree $\alpha_f(x)$ exists and coincides with the first dynamical degree $\delta_f$ for any $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-point $x$ of $X$ with a Zariski dense orbit. Among other results, we show that this holds when $X$ has Kodaira dimension zero and irregularity $q(X) \ge \dim X -1$ or $X$ is an irregular threefold (modulo one possible exception). We also study the existence of Zariski dense orbits, with explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limit laws for ergodic averages with a power singularity over circle rotations were first proved by Sinai and Ulcigrai, as well as Dolgopyat and Fayad. In this paper, we prove limit laws with an estimate for the rate of convergence for the sum $\sum_{n=1}^N f(n \alpha)/n^p$ in terms of a $1$-periodic function $f$ with a power singularity of order $p \ge 1$ at integers. Our results apply in particular to cotangent sums related to Dedekind sums, and to sums of reciprocals of fractional parts, which appear in multiplicative Diophantine approximation. The main tools are Schmidt's method in metric Diophantine approximation, the Gauss-Kuzmin problem and the theory of $\psi$-mixing random variables.</description>

      <title>Positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of convex domains, higher capacities, and Clarke's duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the filtered positive ($S^1$-equivariant) symplectic homology of a convex domain is naturally isomorphic to the filtered singular ($S^1$-equivariant) homology induced by Clarke's dual functional associated with the convex domain. As a result, we prove that the Gutt-Hutchings capacities coincide with the spectral invariants introduced by Ekeland-Hofer for convex domains. From this identification, it follows that Besse convex domains can be characterized by their Gutt-Hutchings capacities, which implies that the interiors of Besse-type convex domains encode information about the Reeb flow on their boundaries. Moreover, as a corollary of the aforementioned isomorphism, we deduce that the barcode entropy associated with the singular homology induced by Clarke's dual functional provides a lower bound for the topological entropy of the Reeb flow on the boundary of a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. In particular, this barcode entropy coincides with the topological entropy for convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admits plenty of almost periodic solutions. Indeed, we prove that arbitrarily close to most of the finite dimensional KAM tori constructed by Kuksin--Poschel in 1996, there exist infinite dimensional non resonant Kronecker tori, i.e. rotational invariant tori. This result answers a natural and longstanding question, well identified by the Hamiltonian PDE community since the first KAM-type result for PDEs by Kuksin in 1987.</description>
