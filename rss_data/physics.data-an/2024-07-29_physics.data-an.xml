      <title>Physics-guided machine learning predicts the planet-scale performance of solar farms with sparse, heterogeneous, public data</title>

Abstract: The photovoltaics (PV) technology landscape is evolving rapidly. To predict the potential and scalability of emerging PV technologies, a global understanding of these systems' performance is essential. Traditionally, experimental and computational studies at large national research facilities have focused on PV performance in specific regional climates. However, synthesizing these regional studies to understand the worldwide performance potential has proven difficult. Given the expense of obtaining experimental data, the challenge of coordinating experiments at national labs across a politically-divided world, and the data-privacy concerns of large commercial operators, however, a fundamentally different, data-efficient approach is desired. Here, we present a physics-guided machine learning (PGML) scheme to demonstrate that: (a) The world can be divided into a few PV-specific climate zones, called PVZones, illustrating that the relevant meteorological conditions are shared across continents; (b) by exploiting the climatic similarities, high-quality monthly energy yield data from as few as five locations can accurately predict yearly energy yield potential with high spatial resolution and a root mean square error of less than 8 kWhm$^{2}$, and (c) even with noisy, heterogeneous public PV performance data, the global energy yield can be predicted with less than 6% relative error compared to physics-based simulations provided that the dataset is representative. This PGML scheme is agnostic to PV technology and farm topology, making it adaptable to new PV technologies or farm configurations. The results encourage physics-guided, data-driven collaboration among national policymakers and research organizations to build efficient decision support systems for accelerated PV qualification and deployment across the world.</description>

      <title>Towards unveiling the large-scale nature of gravity with the wavelet scattering transform</title>

Abstract: We present the first application of the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) in order to constrain the nature of gravity using the three-dimensional (3D) large-scale structure of the universe. Utilizing the Quijote-MG N-body simulations, we can reliably model the 3D matter overdensity field for the f(R) Hu-Sawicki modified gravity (MG) model down to $k_{\rm max}=0.5$ h/Mpc. Combining these simulations with the Quijote $\nu$CDM collection, we then conduct a Fisher forecast of the marginalized constraints obtained on gravity using the WST coefficients and the matter power spectrum at redshift z=0. Our results demonstrate that the WST substantially improves upon the 1$\sigma$ error obtained on the parameter that captures deviations from standard General Relativity (GR), yielding a tenfold improvement compared to the corresponding matter power spectrum result. At the same time, the WST also enhances the precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum of neutrino masses, by factors of 1.2-3.4 compared to the matter power spectrum, respectively. Despite the overall reduction in the WST performance when we focus on larger scales, it still provides a relatively $4.5\times$ tighter 1$\sigma$ error for the MG parameter at $k_{\rm max}=0.2$ h/Mpc, highlighting its great sensitivity to the underlying gravity theory. This first proof-of-concept study reaffirms the constraining properties of the WST technique and paves the way for exciting future applications in order to perform precise large-scale tests of gravity with the new generation of cutting-edge cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Identifying noise transients in gravitational-wave data arising from nonlinear couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise in various interferometer systems can sometimes couple non-linearly to create excess noise in the gravitational wave (GW) strain data. Third-order statistics, such as bicoherence and biphase, can identify these couplings and help discriminate those occurrences from astrophysical GW signals. However, the conventional analysis can yield large bicoherence values even when no phase-coupling is present, thereby, resulting in false identifications. Introducing artificial phase randomization in computing the bicoherence reduces such occurrences with negligible impact on its effectiveness for detecting true phase-coupled disturbances. We demonstrate this property with simulated disturbances in this work. Statistical hypothesis testing is used for distinguishing phase-coupled disturbances from non-phase coupled ones when employing the phase-randomized bicoherence. We also obtain an expression for the bicoherence value that minimizes the sum of the probabilities of false positives and false negatives. This can be chosen as a threshold for shortlisting bicoherence triggers for further scrutiny for the presence of non-linear coupling. Finally, the utility of the phase-randomized bicoherence analysis in GW time-series data is demonstrated for the following three scenarios: (1) Finding third-order statistical similarities within categories of noise transients, such as blips and koi fish. If these non-Gaussian noise transients, or glitches, have a common source, their bicoherence maps can have similarities arising from common bifrequencies related to that source. (2) Differentiating linear or non-linear phase-coupled glitches from compact binary coalescence signals through their bicoherence maps. This is explained with a simulated signal. (3) Identifying repeated bifrequencies in the second and third observation runs (i.e., O2 and O3) of LIGO and Virgo.</description>
