      <title>Rotating spintronic terahertz emitter optimized for microjoule pump-pulse energies and megahertz repetition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) are powerful sources of ultra-broadband single-cycle terahertz (THz) field transients. They work with any pump wavelength, and their polarity and polarization direction are easily adjustable. However, at high pump powers and high repetition rates, STE operation is hampered by a significant increase in the local temperature. Here, we resolve this issue by rotating the STE at a few 100 Hz, thereby distributing the absorbed pump power over a larger area. Our approach permits stable STE operation at a fluence of ~1 mJ/cm$^2$ with up to 18 W pump power at megahertz repetition rates, corresponding to pump-pulse energies of a few 10 $\mu$J and a power density far above the melting threshold of metallic films. The rotating STE is of interest for all ultra-broadband high-power THz applications requiring high repetition rates. As an example, we show that THz pulses with peak fields of 10 kV/cm can be coupled to a THz-lightwave-driven scanning tunneling microscope at 1 MHz repetition rate, demonstrating that the rotating STE can compete with standard THz sources such as LiNbO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spectral Phase Transfer in Four-Wave Mixing with Gas-filled Capillaries: A Trade-off Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-wave mixing (FWM) in gas-filled hollow-core capillaries, a nonlinear optical process that mixes signal and pump photon frequencies to generate idler frequency photons, offers a method for precise spectral phase transfer from signal to idler at ultrashort timescales and extreme powers. However, this regime is challenged by competing linear and nonlinear dynamics, leading to significant trade-offs between spectral phase transfer and conversion efficiency. Our computational investigation focuses on upconversion of femtosecond pulses from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV), a range notoriously difficult to manipulate. We explore an intermediate energy regime that strikes an optimal balance between FWM-mediated phase-transfer fidelity and nonlinear conversion efficiency. By adjusting the energy ratios and spectral phase profiles of the input signal, we achieve conversion efficiencies of approximately 5%-15% while maintaining an effectively quasi-linear spectral phase transfer. These findings contribute to establishing first-principles and scaling laws essential for applications such as high-precision imaging, spectroscopy, quantum transduction, and distributed entangled interconnects, facilitating advanced control of ultrafast photonic and electronic wavepackets in quantum materials with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision.</description>

      <title>Bound state in the continuum and polarization-insensitive electric mirror in low-contrast metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-contrast refractive indexes are pivotal in dielectric metasurfaces for inducing various exotic phenomena, such as the bound state in the continuum (BIC) and electric mirror (EM). However, the limitations of high-index materials are adverse to the practical applications, thus low-contrast metasurfaces with comparable performance are highly desired. Here we present a low-contrast dielectric metasurface comprising radially anisotropic cylinders, which are SiO2 cylinders doped with a small amount of WS2. The cylinder exhibits unidirectional forward superscattering originating from the overlapping of the electric and magnetic dipole resonances. When normal illumination by a near-infrared plane wave, the metasurface consisting of the superscattering constituents manifests a polarization-insensitive EM. Conversely, when subjected to an in-plane incoming wave, the metasurface generates a symmetry-protected BIC characterized by an ultrahigh Q factor and nearly negligible out-of-plane energy radiation. Our work highlights the doping approach as an efficient strategy for designing low-contrast functional metasurfaces and sheds new light on the potential applications in photonic integrated circuits and on-chip optical communication.</description>

      <title>High Numerical Aperture and Broadband Achromatic Flat Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat lenses have shown promising applications in miniaturized and ultracompact lightweight optical systems. However, it has been a great challenge in simultaneously achieving broadband achromatism and high numerical aperture. Here, we demonstrate that this long-term dilemma can be broken through by the zone division multiplex of the meta-atoms on a composite substrate possessing stepwise optical thickness. The aperture size can be freely expanded by increasing the optical thickness difference between the central and marginal zones of the substrate, free from achromatic bandwidth. The achromatic flat lens with both 0.9 numerical aperture and bandwidth of 650-1000 nm is experimentally achieved. A microscopic imaging with 1.1 {\mu}m resolution has also demonstrated. These unprecedented performances mark a substantial step toward practical applications of the flat lenses.</description>

      <title>Rytov Approximation of Vectorial Waves by Modifying Scattering Matrixes: Precise Reconstruction of Dielectric Tensor Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing 3D anisotropic materials presents significant challenges, especially when assessing 3D orientations, material distributions, and anisotropies through scattered light, due to the inherently vectorial nature of light-matter interactions. In this study, we formulate a scattering theory based on the Rytov approximation, commonly employed in scalar wave tomography, tailored to accommodate vector waves by modifying the scattering matrix. Using this formulation, we investigate the intricate 3D structure of liquid crystals with multiple topological defects exploiting dielectric tensor tomography. By leveraging dielectric tensor tomography, we successfully visualize these topological defects in three dimensions, a task that conventional 2D imaging techniques fail to achieve.</description>

      <title>Topological polarization singularities induced by the non-Hermitian Dirac points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Dirac point in the Hermitian photonic system will split into a pair of exceptional points (EPs) or even spawn a ring of EPs if non-Hermiticity is involved. Here, we present a new type of non-Hermitian Dirac point which is situated in the complex plane of eigenfrequency. When there is differential loss, the Dirac point exhibits a dual behavior: it not only splits into a pair of EPs with opposite chirality in the band structure but also induces a pair of circularly polarized states (C points) with opposite handedness in the far-field radiation. Furthermore, breaking the corresponding mirror symmetries enables independent control of these Dirac-point induced C points, facilitating the merging of two C points and generation of unidirectional guided resonances. Our results demonstrate an explicit relation between the band singularities and polarization singularities, and provide a new mechanism to generate unidirectional emission, which can be useful in the band engineering and polarization manipulation.</description>

      <title>Power-dependent destabilization forces in trapping nanographene-based nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic optical tweezers have been used to trap nanoparticles and study interactions with their environment. An unavoidable challenge is the plasmonic heating due to resonant excitation and the resulting temperature rise in the surrounding environment. In this work, we demonstrate optical trapping of nanographene-based polymeric nanoparticles using metamaterial plasmonic tweezers. We achieved superior trapping performance and trap stiffness values as high as 8.8 (fN/nm)/(mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$) with optical intensities lower than 1 (mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$). A range of incident intensities was used to monitor the effect of increasing intensity in the trapping performance. Higher intensities resulted in stronger optical forces, but thermal effects tended to destabilize the trapping. Beyond a critical intensity, where the temperature rise reached 24$^o$C, a large number of particles were being trapped with lower stiffness values indicating the presence of thermal flows. We, therefore, identified a safe intensity regime to avoid detrimental thermal effects. Our platform is ideal for multiple particle trapping in an array configuration and could be used for stable nanopositioning of quantum emitters with controlled interactions with their environment, potentially useful in the field of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Revealing mode formation in quasi-bound states in the continuum metasurfaces via near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, all of which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high quality factors and strong near-field enhancement. Here, we quantitatively investigate the mode formation in quasi-BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique. We find that the quasi-BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10 x 10-unit cells much smaller than expected from far-field measurements. Furthermore, we show that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi-BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far-field and near-field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Off-axis holographic imaging with undetected light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected light (QIUL) can retrieve amplitude and phase information of an object by exploiting the quantum correlations of photon-pairs generated through spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), where the illumination and detection can be carried at very distinct wavelength ranges. This fact allows to benefit from a mature detection technology in the visible spectral range, while probing the object at a more exotic wavelength. Here we experimentally implement a QIUL approach with Fourier off-axis holography in a hybrid-type induced-coherence non-linear interferometer. Our approach reconstructs the amplitude and phase information of an object with a single shot in a wide-field configuration, being an alternative in front of techniques that require multiple acquisition frames, such as phase-shifting holography.</description>

      <title>Kerr Nonlinearity Induced Nonreciprocity in dissipatively coupled resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearity induced nonreciprocity is studied in a system comprising two resonators coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide when the linear system does not exhibit nonreciprocity. The analysis is based on the Hamiltonian of the coupled system and includes the dissipative coupling between the waveguide and resonators, along with the input-output relations. We consider a large number of scenarios which can lead to nonreciprocity. We pay special attention to the case when the linear system does not exhibit nonreciprocal behavior. In this case, we show how very significant nonreciprocal behavior can result from Kerr nonlinearities. We find that the bistability of the nonlinear system can aid in achieving large nonreciprocity. Additionally, We bring out nonreciprocity in the excitation of each resonator, which can be monitored independently. Our results highlight the profound influence of nonlinearity on nonreciprocal behavior, offering a new avenue for controlling light propagation in integrated photonic circuits. Nonlinearity induced nonreciprocity would lead to significant nonreciprocity in quantum fluctuations when our system is treated quantum mechanically.</description>

      <title>Layered Babinet complementary patterns acting as asymmetric negative index metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal orientation and handedness dependence of the optical responses, accompanied by asymmetric transmission and asymmetric dichroism, were demonstrated on multilayers constructed with subwavelength periodic arrays of Babinet complementary miniarrays, illuminated by linearly and circularly polarized light. In case of single-sided illumination asymmetric optical responses were observed at the spectral location of maximal cross-polarization that is accompanied by radiative electric dipoles on the nano-objects; whereas negative index material phenomenon was demonstrated, where the electric and magnetic dipoles overlap both spatially and spectrally. The NIM is accompanied by electric multipoles that add up non-radiatively and correlates with the magnetic dipoles characteristic on the nano-entities. By illuminating the multilayer with two counter-propagating circularly polarized beams it was proven that asymmetrical normal component displacement currents at the bounding interfaces arising along flat and tilted bands accompany the asymmetric co-polarized and cross-polarized transmission, respectively. The latter correlates with the asymmetric dichroism in the cross-polarized signal observed in case of single-sided circularly polarized light illumination. The dispersion maps in the single-sided asymmetrical co-polarized reflectance and absorptance indicate flat bands of analogous and complementary extrema, proving the dichroic nature of the observed asymmetric phenomena. The multilayer is proposed as an ultrathin NIM and nonreciprocal nanophotonic element.</description>

      <title>Controllable suppression of Non-Hermitian skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a phenomenon in which the bulk states tends to the boundary in Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and has a wide range of application scenarios. The fully understanding of the skin mode anomalies in NHSEs is vital for the application. Recently, some innovative work reported the suppression [Phys. Rev. Lett 127, 256402 (2021)] and enhancement [Phys. Rev. Lett 131, 116601 (2023)] of NHSEs by magnetic field, respectively. In our work, we constructed magnetic field-like onsite potential energy distribution and random-like onsite potential energy distribution, and found that onsite potential energy has non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns on skin modes. Non-monotonic and monotonic suppression patterns are two typical forms in the transition from order to disorder. Only relying on onsite potential energy, not only we have obtained a profound understanding of the connection and difference between order and disorder, but also developed a general strategy to achieve both robustness and adjustability of the skin modes. By linking with the scaling theory in disorder, the controllable suppression of NHSEs, based on mutual transformation between order and disorder, is generalized to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the underlying processes that locally dominate physical interactions is the key to understanding nonlinear dynamics. Machine-learning techniques have recently been shown to be highly promising in automating the search for dominant physics, adding important insights that complement analytical methods and empirical intuition. Here we apply a fully unsupervised approach to the search for dominant balance during nonlinear and dispersive propagation in optical fiber, and show that we can algorithmically identify dominant interactions in cases of optical wavebreaking, soliton fission, dispersive wave generation, and Raman soliton emergence. We discuss how dominant balance manifests both in the temporal and spectral domains as a function of propagation distance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Whispering Gallery Mode Phase Shift using Indistinguishable Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator coupled to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and show a bimodal coincidence transmission spectrum when the input state is an indistinguishable photon pair. This is due to the doubled WGM phase shift experienced by the path-entangled state in the interferometer. Further, we model the noise in a WGM resonance shift measurement comparing photon pairs with a coherent state. At least a four-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is possible, with clear implications for quantum-enhanced WGM sensing.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous illuminated image enhancement under extremely low visibility condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging through fog significantly impacts fields such as object detection and recognition. In conditions of extremely low visibility, essential image information can be obscured, rendering standard extraction methods ineffective. Traditional digital processing techniques, such as histogram stretching, aim to mitigate fog effects by enhancing object light contrast diminished by atmospheric scattering. However, these methods often experience reduce effectiveness under inhomogeneous illumination. This paper introduces a novel approach that adaptively filters background illumination under extremely low visibility and preserve only the essential signal information. Additionally, we employ a visual optimization strategy based on image gradients to eliminate grayscale banding. Finally, the image is transformed to achieve high contrast and maintain fidelity to the original information through maximum histogram equalization. Our proposed method significantly enhances signal clarity in conditions of extremely low visibility and outperforms existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>A manufacturable platform for photonic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst holding great promise for low noise, ease of operation and networking, useful photonic quantum computing has been precluded by the need for beyond-state-of-the-art components, manufactured by the millions. Here we introduce a manufacturable platform for quantum computing with photons. We benchmark a set of monolithically-integrated silicon photonics-based modules to generate, manipulate, network, and detect photonic qubits, demonstrating dual-rail photonic qubits with $99.98\% \pm 0.01\%$ state preparation and measurement fidelity, Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference between independent photon sources with $99.50\%\pm0.25\%$ visibility, two-qubit fusion with $99.22\%\pm0.12\%$ fidelity, and a chip-to-chip qubit interconnect with $99.72\%\pm0.04\%$ fidelity, not accounting for loss. In addition, we preview a selection of next generation technologies, demonstrating low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components, fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters.</description>

      <title>Frequency comb generation via synchronous pumped $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator on thin-film lithium niobate</title>

Abstract: Resonator-based optical frequency comb generation is an enabling technology for a myriad of applications ranging from communications to precision spectroscopy. These frequency combs can be generated in nonlinear resonators driven using either continuous-wave (CW) light, which requires alignment of the pump frequency with the cavity resonance, or pulsed light, which also mandates that the pulse repetition rate and cavity free spectral range (FSR) are carefully matched. Advancements in nanophotonics have ignited interest in chip-scale optical frequency combs. However, realizing pulse-driven on-chip Kerr combs remains challenging, as microresonator cavities have limited tuning range in their FSR and resonance frequency. Here, we take steps to overcome this limitation and demonstrate broadband frequency comb generation using a $\chi^{(3)}$ resonator synchronously pumped by a tunable femtosecond pulse generator with on-chip amplitude and phase modulators. Notably, employing pulsed pumping overcomes limitations in Kerr comb generation typically seen in crystalline resonators from stimulated Raman scattering.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-free low-temperature silica for next generation integrated photonics</title>

Abstract: The advances in novel low-loss "on insulator" integrated photonics platforms beyond silicon, such as thin-film LiNbO3, LiTaO3, GaP and BaTiO3 have demonstrated major potential across a wide range of applications, due to their unique electro-optical or nonlinear optical properties. This has heralded novel devices, ranging from low-voltage and high-speed modulators to parametric amplifiers. For such photonic integrated circuits, a low-loss SiO2 cladding layer is a key element, serving as a passivation layer for the waveguides and enabling efficient fiber-to-chip coupling. However, numerous novel ferroelectric or III-V "on insulator" platforms have low tolerances for process temperature. This prohibits using high-temperature anneals to remove hydrogen, a common impurity that is inherent to ordinary chemical vapor deposited SiO2 and causes significant optical loss in the near infrared. Here, we satisfy the dichotomy of a low-loss wafer scale manufactured SiO2 cladding and low processing temperature. Inspired by the manufacturing of optical fibers, we introduce a hydrogen-free, low-loss SiO2 cladding that is deposited at low temperatures (300 degrees Celsius) by using SiCl4 and O2 as precursors in inductively coupled plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (ICPCVD). By replacing hydrogenous silicon precursors (e.g. SiH4) with SiCl4, the deposited film is inherently free from residual hydrogen. The process temperature is compatible with the "on insulator" platforms and CMOS electronic integrated circuits. We demonstrate a wide low-loss window that covers all telecommunication bands from 1260 nm to 1625 nm. We achieve a &lt; 2.5 dB/m waveguide loss at 1550 nm, comparable with 1200 degree Celsius annealed films. Our SiCl4 process provides a key future cladding for all recently emerged "on-insulator" photonics platforms, that is low cost, scalable in manufacturing, and directly foundry compatible.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS): A Comprehensive Approach to Label-free Absorption Microscopy Across Biological Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques have evolved as effective tools for non-invasive chemical specific structural, and functional imaging. Yet most modern label-free microscopy modalities target only a fraction of the contrast afforded by an optical absorption interaction. We introduce a comprehensive optical absorption microscopy technique, Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), which simultaneously captures the dominant light matter interactions which occur as a pulse of light is absorbed by a molecule. In PARS, the optical scattering, attenuation, and the transient radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes are collected at each optical absorption event. This provides a complete representation of the absorption event, providing unique contrast presented here as the total absorption (TA) and quantum efficiency ratio (QER) measurements. By capturing a complete view of each absorption interaction, PARS bridges many of the specificity challenges associated with label-free imaging, facilitating recovery of a wider range of biomolecules than independent radiative or non-radiative modalities. To show the versatility of PARS, we explore imaging across a wide range of biological specimens, from single cells to in-vivo imaging of living subjects. These examples of label-free histopathological imaging, and vascular imaging illustrate some of the numerous fields where PARS may have profound impacts. Overall PARS may provide comprehensive label-free contrast in a wide variety of biological specimens, providing otherwise inaccessible visualizations, and representing a new a source of rich data to develop new AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation of the Stokes Vector Rotation for a General Polarimetric Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical polarimetry is a well-established discipline with diverse applications across different branches of science. The burgeoning interest in leveraging quantum resources to achieve highly sensitive measurements has spurred researchers to elucidate the behavior of polarized light within a quantum mechanical framework, thereby fostering the development of a quantum theory of polarimetry. In this work, drawing inspiration from polarimetric investigations in biological tissues, we investigate the precision limits of polarization rotation angle estimation about a known rotation axis, in a quantum polarimetric process, comprising three distinct quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. The diattenuator and depolarizer channels, acting on the probe state, can be thought of as effective noise processes. We explore the precision constraints inherent in quantum polarimetry by evaluating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for probe states of significance in quantum metrology, namely NOON, Kings of Quantumness, and Coherent states. The effects of the noise channels as well as their ordering is analyzed on the estimation error of the rotation angle to characterize practical and optimal quantum probe states for quantum polarimetry. Furthermore, we propose an experimental framework tailored for NOON state quantum polarimetry, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high harmonic conversion of a seeded free-electron laser via harmonic optical klystron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: External seeded free-electron lasers (FELs) are compelling tools for generating fully coherent EUV and soft X-ray radiations. Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG), the most typical representative of external seeded FELs, has witnessed a remarkable growth of fully coherent FELs in the last decade, continuously evolving towards higher harmonic conversions and shorter wavelengths. Ultra-high harmonic generation is imperative in the field of FELs. This paper presents a novel method for generating FEL radiation with ultra-high harmonic conversion, utilizing harmonic optical klystron in combination with EEHG. This method can effectively increase the harmonic conversion order to about 90. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that intense and almost fully coherent FEL pulses can be generated with a wavelength of 3 nm. At the same time, the seed laser intensity required by this scheme is lower compared to nominal EEHG, thus facilitating the generation of high-repetition-rate seeded FELs.</description>

      <title>(Sub-)picosecond surface correlations of femtosecond laser excited Al-coated multilayers observed by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond high-intensity laser pulses at intensities surpassing $10^{14} \,\text{W}/\text{cm}^2$ can generate a diverse range of functional surface nanostructures. Achieving precise control over the production of these functional structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the surface morphology dynamics with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and picosecond-scale temporal resolution. In this study, we show that individual XFEL pulses can elucidate structural changes on surfaces induced by laser-generated plasmas, employing grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). Using aluminum-coated multilayer samples we can differentiate between ultrafast surface morphology dynamics and subsequent subsurface density dynamics, achieving nanometer-depth sensitivity and subpicosecond temporal resolution. The observed subsurface density dynamics serve to validate advanced simulation models depicting matter under extreme conditions. Our findings promise to unveil novel avenues for laser material nanoprocessing and high-energy-density science.</description>
