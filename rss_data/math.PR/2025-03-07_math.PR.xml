      <title>Limit laws for the generalized Zagreb indices of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the limiting behavior of the generalized Zagreb indices of the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) random graph $G(n,p)$, as $n\to\infty$. For any integer $k\ge1$, we first give an expression for the $k$-th order generalized Zagreb index in terms of the number of star graphs of various sizes in any simple graph. The explicit formulas for the first two moments of the generalized Zagreb indices of an ER random graph are then obtained by this expression. Based on the asymptotic normality of the numbers of star graphs of various sizes, several joint limit laws are established for a finite number of generalized Zagreb indices with a phase transition for $p$ in different regimes. Finally, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any single generalized Zagreb index of $G(n,p)$ to be asymptotic normal.</description>

      <title>On Two Parameter Time-Changed Poisson Random Fields with Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the composition of bivariate L\'evy process with bivariate inverse subordinator. The explicit expressions for its dispersion and auto correlation matrices are obtained. Also, the time-changed two parameter L\'evy processes with rectangular increments are studied. We introduce some time-changed variants of the Poisson random field in plane with and without drift, and derive the associated fractional differential equations for their distributions. Later, we consider some time-changed L\'evy processes where the time-changing components are two parameter Poisson random fields with drifts. Moreover, two parameter coordinatewise semigroup operators associated with some of the introduced processes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Guided smoothing and control for diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smoothing distribution is the conditional distribution of the diffusion process in the space of trajectories given noisy observations made continuously in time. It is generally difficult to sample from this distribution. We use the theory of enlargement of filtrations to show that the conditional process has an additional drift term derived from the backward filtering distribution that is moving or guiding the process towards the observations. This term is intractable, but its effect can be equally introduced by replacing it with a heuristic, where importance weights correct for the discrepancy. From this Markov Chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo algorithms are derived to sample from the smoothing distribution. The choice of the guiding heuristic is discussed from an optimal control perspective and evaluated. The results are tested numerically on a stochastic differential equation for reaction-diffusion.</description>

      <title>An integrable bound for semilinear rough partial differential equations with unbounded diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops moment bounds for the controlled rough path norm of the solution of semilinear rough partial differential equations.~The novel aspects are two-fold: first we consider rough paths of low time regularity $\gamma\in(1/4,1/2)$ and second treat unbounded diffusion coefficients. To this aim we introduce a suitable notion of a controlled rough path according to a monotone scale of Banach spaces and innovative control functions.</description>

      <title>Polling on a circle with non-uniform batch arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a polling system on a circle with. Random batches of customers arrive at a circle, where each customer, independently, obtains a location according to a general distribution. A single server cyclically travels over the circle to serve all customers. We analyze the experienced delay of batches for two service policies: globally gated and exhaustive. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the experienced delay is found under the former policy. For the latter policy, we propose a mean-value analysis, resulting in an algorithmic approach for the evaluation of the mean experienced delay. Light- and heavy-traffic limits are derived exactly for the system performance.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Loop Soup via Wilson's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is twofold: first, we explain the relation between the isomorphism theorems in the context of vertex reinforced jump process discovered in [BHS19, BHS21] and the standard Markovian isomorphism theorems for Markovian jump processes; second, we introduce the vertex reinforced counterpart of the standard Poissonian loop soup developed by Le Jan [LJ10]. To this end, we propose an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of Wilson's algorithm with reinforcement. We establish the isomorphism theorems for the erased loops and the random walk from this algorithm, and in particular provide a concrete construction of the reinforced loop soup via a random process with a reinforcement mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the orthogonal expansion of the fractional Brownian motion relative to the Legendre polynomials. It has not only theoretical but also practical interest, since it can be applied to approximate and simulate the fractional Brownian motion in continuous time. The relations for the mean square approximation error are presented, and a comparison with the previously obtained result is carried out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer partition of $n$ into distinct parts, the sum of the reciprocal parts is an example of an egyptian fraction. We study this statistic under the uniform measure on distinct parts partitions of $n$ and prove that, as $n \to \infty$, the sum of reciprocal parts is distributed away from its mean like a random harmonic sum.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Divergences in Central Limit Theorems: Old and New</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an overview of various results and methods related to information-theoretic distances of R\'enyi type in the light of their applications to the central limit theorem (CLT). The first part (Sections 1-9) is devoted to the total variation and the Kullback-Leibler distance (relative entropy). In the second part (Sections 10-15) we discuss general properties of R\'enyi and Tsallis divergences of order $\alpha&gt;1$, and then in the third part (Sections 16-21) we turn to the CLT and non-uniform local limit theorems with respect to these strong distances. In the fourth part (Sections 22-31), we discuss recent results on strictly subgaussian distributions and describe necessary and sufficient conditions which ensure the validity of the CLT with respect to the R\'enyi divergence of infinite order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed as models for random dendritic growth in two dimensions, and as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra in problems in classical function theory. These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new interpretation of the Lions derivative as the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a vector measure, which provides a canonical extension of the Lions derivative for functions taking values in infinite dimensional Banach spaces. This is of particular relevance for the analysis of Hilbert space valued Mean-Field equations. As an illustration we derive a mild Ito-formula for Mean-Field stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which provides the basis for a higher order Taylor expansion and higher order numerical schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a partition function on a finite version of this model and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition function and correlation function. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in several applications through its various scaling limits, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

      <title>On convex order and supermodular order without finite mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many results on the convex order in the literature were stated for random variables with finite mean. For instance, a fundamental result in dependence modeling is that the sum of a pair of random random variables is upper bounded in convex order by that of its comonotonic version and lower bounded by that of its counter-monotonic version, and all existing proofs of this result require the random variables' expectations to be finite. We show that the above result remains true even when discarding the finite-mean assumption, and obtain several other results on the comparison of infinite-mean random variables via the convex order. To our surprise, we find two deceivingly similar definitions of the convex order, both of which exist widely in the literature, and they are not equivalent for random variables with infinite mean. This subtle discrepancy in definitions also applies to the supermodular order, and it gives rise to some incorrect statements, often found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for first-passage percolation on logarithmic subgraphs of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $a&gt;0$ and $b \geq 0$, let $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ be the subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ induced by the vertices between the first coordinate axis and the graph of the function $f = f_{a,b}(u) = a \log (1+u) + b \log(1+\log(1+u))$, $u \geq 0$. It is known that for $a&gt;0$, the critical value for Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{G}_f = \mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ is strictly between $1/2$ and $1$, and that if $b&gt;2a$ then the percolation phase transition is discontinuous. We study first-passage percolation (FPP) on $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ with i.i.d. edge-weights $(\tau_e)$ satisfying $p = \mathbb{P}(\tau_e=0) \in [1/2,1)$ and the "gap condition" $\mathbb{P}(\tau_e \leq \delta) = p$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. We find the rate of growth of the expected passage time in $\mathbb{G}_f$ from the origin to the line $x=n$, and show that, while when $p=1/2$ it is of order $n/(a \log n)$, when $p&gt;1/2$ it can be of order (a) $n^{c_1}/(\log n)^{c_2}$, (b) $(\log n)^{c_3}$, (c) $\log \log n$, or (d) constant, depending on the relationship between $a,b,$ and $p$. For more general functions $f$, we prove a central limit theorem for the passage time and show that its variance grows at the same rate as the mean. As a consequence of our methods, we improve the percolation transition result by showing that the phase transition on $\mathbb{G}_{a,b}$ is discontinuous if and only if $b &gt; a$, and improve "sponge crossing dimensions" asymptotics from the '80s on subcritical percolation crossing probabilities for tall thin rectangles.</description>

      <title>Expected number of jumps and the number of active particles in TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a TASEP on $\mathbb Z$ with the step initial condition we identify limits as $t\to\infty$ of the expected total number of jumps until time $t&gt;0$ and the expected number of active particles at a time $t$. We also connect the two quantities proving that non-asymptotically, that is as a function of $t&gt;0$, the latter is the derivative of the former. Our approach builds on asymptotics derived by Rost and intensive use of the fact that the rightmost particle evolves according to the Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Jamming pair of general run-and-tumble particles: Exact results, symmetries and steady-state universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While run-and-tumble particles are a foundational model for self-propelled particles as bacteria or Janus particles, the analytical derivation of their steady state from the microscopic details is still an open problem. By directly modeling the system at the continuous-space and -time level thanks to piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), we derive the conservation conditions which sets the invariant distribution and, more importantly, explicitly construct the two universality classes for the steady state, the detailed-jamming and the global-jamming classes. They respectively identify with the preservation or not in a detailed manner of a symmetry at the level of the dynamical internal states between probability flows entering and exiting jamming configurations. We call such symmetry active global balance, as it is the true nonequilibrium counterpart of the equilibrium global balance. Thanks to a spectral analysis of the tumble kernel, we give explicit expressions for the invariant measure in the general case. We show that the non-equilibrium features exhibited by the steady state include positive mass for the jammed configurations and, for the global-jamming class, exponential decay and growth terms, potentially modulated by polynomial terms. Interestingly, we find that the invariant measure follows, away from jamming configurations, a catenary-like constraint, which results from the interplay between probability conservation and the dynamical skewness introduced by the jamming interactions, seen now as a boundary constraint. This work shows the powerful analytical approach PDMP provide for the study of the stationary behaviors of RTP systems and motivates their future applications to larger systems, with the goal to derive microscopic conditions for motility-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A note on the Long-Time behaviour of Stochastic McKean-Vlasov Equations with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the long-term behavior of solutions to nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equations driven by common noise, where the drift term has a linear dependence on the measure. These equations, which describe the evolution of probability distributions, naturally arise in the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems driven by both idiosyncratic and common noises. After proving the existence of an invariant measure under some mild conditions, we first consider the case where the confinement potential is uniformly convex. In this setting, we establish a result of uniform-in-time conditional propagation of chaos for the associated particle system. This result directly implies the uniqueness of the long-term behavior for solutions of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. Then, we highlight a more surprising phenomenon of uniqueness recovery induced by the addition of common noise in the non-convex case, albeit under more restrictive structural assumptions. Specifically, we show that the presence of common noise leads to uniqueness and exponential convergence towards equilibrium in the absence of idiosyncratic noise. This result emphasizes the stabilizing role of common noise in systems where non-convex potentials would typically allow for multiple invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions.</description>

      <title>POSERS: Steganography-Driven Molecular Tagging Using Randomized DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses a significant challenge across multiple industries, leading to financial losses and health risks. While DNA-based molecular tagging has emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely on predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as sequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we introduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized Sequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences. POSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions within randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting attempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be adjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We mathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test, successfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our results highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution for secure product authentication.</description>
