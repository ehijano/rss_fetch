      <title>The reverse mathematics of bounded Ramsey's theorem for pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a degenerate version of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors ($\mathsf{RT}^2_2$), in which the homogeneous sets for color 1 are of bounded size. By $\mathsf{RT}^2_2$, it follows that every such coloring admits an infinite homogeneous set for color 0. This statement, called $\mathsf{BRT}^2_2$, is known to be computably true, that is, every computable instance admits a computable solution, but the known proofs use $\Sigma^0_2$-induction ($\mathsf{I}\Sigma_2^0$). We prove that $\mathsf{BRT}^2_2$ follows from the Erd\H{o}s-Moser theorem but not from the Ascending Descending sequence principle, and that its computably true version is equivalent to $\mathsf{I}\Sigma_2^0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$.</description>

      <title>Computability of dimension groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the computability of the isomorphism set $\operatorname{Iso}(G_A,G_B)$ between $G_A$ and $G_B$, where $G_A$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ generated by columns of integer powers of a non-singular $n \times n$-matrix $A$ with integer entries. Assuming that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is irreducible -- and under an additional condition when $n$ is not prime -- we prove that $\operatorname{Iso}(G_A,G_B)$ is computable; that is, there exists an algorithm that determines the structure in finitely many steps. We also present illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law'' for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible worlds than the uniform distribution does.</description>

      <title>All Ordinals are Cop-Robber Ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The game of cops and robbers, played on a fixed graph $G$, is a two-player game, where the cop and the robber (the players) take turns in moving to adjacent vertices. The game finishes if the cop lands on the robber's vertex. In that case we say that the cop wins. If the cop can always win, regardless of the starting positions, we say that $G$ is a cop-win graph.
  For a finite cop-win graph $G$ we can ask for the minimum number $n$ such that, regardless of the starting positions, the game will end in at most $n$ steps. This number is called the maximum capture time of $G$. By looking at finite paths, we see that any non-negative integer is the maximum capture time for a cop-win graph.
  What about infinite cop-win graphs? In this case, the notion of capture time is nicely generalised if one works with ordinals, and so the question becomes which ordinals can be the the maximum capture time of a cop-win graph? These ordinals are called CR (Cop-Robber)-ordinals. In this paper we fully settle this by showing that all ordinals are CR-ordinals, answering a question of Bonato, Gordinowicz and Hahn.</description>

      <title>Stabilizers and NIP arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the NIP arithmetic regularity lemma for finite groups (due to the authors and Pillay), which describes the approximate structure of "NIP sets" in finite groups, i.e., subsets whose collection of left translates has bounded VC-dimension. Our new proof avoids sophisticated ingredients from the model theory of NIP formulas (e.g., Borel definability and generic compact domination). The key tool is an elaboration on an elementary lemma due to Alon, Fox, and Zhao concerning the behavior of subgroups contained in stabilizers. We adapt this lemma to arbitrary subsets of stabilizers using technical (but elementary) maneuvers based on work of Sisask. Using another trick from Alon, Fox, and Zhao, we then give an effective proof of a related result of the first author and Pillay on finite NIP sets of bounded tripling in arbitrary groups. Along the way, we show that NIP sets satisfy a strong form of the Polynomial Bogolyubov-Ruzsa Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Stratifications and term description over valued fields with analytic structure, uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a certain strong smooth stratification of sets and a term description of functions, which are definable over valued fields (possibly non algebraically closed) with separated analytic structure. The basic tools are: elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable functions, Lipschitz cell decomposition with preparation of $RV$-parametrized sets, and a non-Archimedean definable version of Bierstone-Milman's canonical desingularization algorithm, achieved in an earlier paper of ours. As application, we give uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations over Henselian fields $K$ with separated analytic structure.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Calibration Error in Neural Networks Through Evidence-Based Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the elementary theory of Young--Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ we consider the first-order theory, that is defined by set $P$ and relation $\leqslant$. The problem of undecidability of combinatorial theories attracts significant attention. Recently A. Wires proved the undecidability of the elementary theory of Young lattice and also established the maximal definability property of this theory. The purpose of this article is to obtain the same results for another graded lattice, which has much in common with Young lattice: Young--Fibonacci lattice. As Wires does for Young lattice, for the proof of undecidability we define Arithmetic into this theory.</description>
