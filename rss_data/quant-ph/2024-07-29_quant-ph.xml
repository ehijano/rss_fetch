      <title>Dynamics of Entanglement Generation and Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the generating and transfer of entanglement during adiabatic interactions can be traced to a succession of avoided energy level crossings at which eigenvalues swap their eigenvectors. These swaps of eigenvectors weave the entanglement in multi-partite systems. The efficiency of this weaving of entanglement depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and it is, therefore, constraining the speed of adiabatic evolution. This relates an adiabatic quantum computation's complexity, as measured by its minimum duration, to that quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement. To derive these results, we employ the spectral theorem to decompose interaction Hamiltonians into rank-one projectors and we then use the adiabatic theorem to successively adiabatically introduce these projectors. For each projector activation, using recent exact results on the behaviour of eigensystems under the addition of Hamiltonians, we can then non-perturbatively calculate the entanglement dynamics. Our findings provide new tools for the analysis and control of the dynamics of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum landscape tomography for efficient single-gate optimization on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several proposals aiming to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term quantum computers rely on the optimization of variational circuits. These approaches include, for example, variational quantum eigensolvers and many-body quantum simulators and their realization with limited computational techniques critically depends on the development of efficient optimization techniques. In this paper, we introduce a new optimization strategy for dense quantum circuits, leveraging tensor network optimization principles. Our approach focuses on optimizing one gate at a time by fully characterizing the dependency of the cost function on the gate through environment tensor tomography, obtained via noisy measurements on a quantum device. We compute the minimal number of measurements needed to perform a full tensor tomography and relate this number to unitary 2-design. We then describe a general framework for landscape tomography based on linear regression and compare two different implementations based on shadow tomography and Clifford tableaux, respectively. Finally, we compare our strategy with both gradient-free optimization and gradient-based optimization based on the parameter-shift rule, highlighting potential benefits of our algorithm for the development of quantum algorithms in noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Design and demonstration of an operating system for executing applications on quantum network nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of future quantum networks is to enable new internet applications that are impossible to achieve using solely classical communication. Up to now, demonstrations of quantum network applications and functionalities on quantum processors have been performed in ad-hoc software that was specific to the experimental setup, programmed to perform one single task (the application experiment) directly into low-level control devices using expertise in experimental physics. Here, we report on the design and implementation of the first architecture capable of executing quantum network applications on quantum processors in platform-independent high-level software. We demonstrate the architecture's capability to execute applications in high-level software, by implementing it as a quantum network operating system -- QNodeOS -- and executing test programs including a delegated computation from a client to a server on two quantum network nodes based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware, by multitasking different applications on a quantum network for the first time. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an additional driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ atom. Our architecture lays the groundwork for computer science research in the domain of quantum network programming, and paves the way for the development of software that can bring quantum network technology to society.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot, Robust Calibration of Single Qubit Gates Using Bayesian Robust Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of control parameters in quantum gates is crucial for high-fidelity operations, yet it represents a significant time and resource challenge, necessitating periods of downtime for quantum computers. Robust Phase Estimation (RPE) has emerged as a practical and effective calibration technique aimed at tackling this challenge. It combines a provably efficient number of control pulses with a classical post-processing algorithm to estimate the phase accumulated by a quantum gate. We introduce Bayesian Robust Phase Estimation (BRPE), an innovative approach that integrates Bayesian parameter estimation into the classical post-processing phase to reduce the sampling overhead. Our numerical analysis shows that BRPE markedly reduces phase estimation errors, requiring approximately $50\%$ fewer samples than standard RPE. Specifically, in an ideal, noise-free setting, it achieves up to a $96\%$ reduction in average absolute estimation error for a fixed sample cost of $88$ shots when compared to RPE. Under a depolarizing noise model, it attains up to a $47\%$ reduction for a fixed cost of $176$ shots. Additionally, we adapt BRPE for Ramsey spectroscopy applications and successfully implement it experimentally in a trapped ion system.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in (2 + 1)D subsystem-symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of unitary evolution and projective measurements is a modern interest in the study of many-body entanglement. On the one hand, the competition between these two processes leads to the recently-discovered measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). On the other, measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a well-known computational model studying how measurements simulate unitary evolution utilizing the entanglement of special resources such as the 2D cluster state. The entanglement properties enabling MBQC may be attributed to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders, particularly subsystem symmetric (SSPT) orders. It was recently found that the 1D cluster state may be associated with an SPT phase in random circuits respecting a global $Z_2 \times Z_2$ symmetry, and furthermore that all phase transitions in this scenario belong to the same universality class. As resources with greater computational power feature greater symmetry, it is fruitful to investigate further any relationship between levels of symmetry in MIPTs and MBQC. In this paper we investigate MIPTs on a torus with three levels of symmetry-respecting unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. Although we find two area-law phases and one volume-law phase with distinct entanglement structures for each ensemble, the phase transition from the volume-law phase to the area-law phase associated with the 2D cluster state has variable correlation length exponent $\nu$. Whereas $\nu\approx 0.90$ for unconstrained Clifford unitaries and $\nu\approx 0.83$ for globally-symmetric Cliffords, subsystem-symmetric Cliffords feature a much smaller value $\nu\approx 0.38$. It is speculated that the hierarchy of distinct transitions seen in these random monitored quantum circuit models might have consequences for computational universality in MBQC.</description>

      <title>Explicit block encodings of boundary value problems for many-body elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</description>

      <title>Cross-resonance control of an oscillator with a fluxonium ancilla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional displacement (CD) gate between an oscillator and a discrete-variable ancilla plays a key role in quantum information processing tasks, such as enabling universal control of the oscillator and longitudinal readout of the qubit. However, the gate is unprotected against the propagation of ancilla decay errors and hence not fault-tolerant. Here, we propose a CD gate scheme with fluxonium as the ancilla, which has been experimentally demonstrated to have a large noise bias and millisecond-level lifetimes. The proposed gate is applied cross-resonantly by modulating the external flux of the fluxonium at the frequency of the target oscillator, which requires minimal hardware overhead and does not increase sensitivity to decoherence mechanisms like dephasing. We further provide a perturbative description of the gate mechanism and identify the error budget. Additionally, we develop an approximate procedure for choosing device and gate parameters that optimizes gate performance. Following the procedure for multiple sets of fluxonium parameters from the literature, we numerically demonstrate CD gates with unitary fidelity exceeding 99.9% and gate times of hundreds of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Linear-Size Ancilla Systems for Logical Measurements in QLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to perform all logical Clifford gates on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code, also known as the gross code. The scheme adds about 100 ancilla qubits into the connectivity graph, and one of the twelve logical qubits is sacrificed for gate synthesis. Logical measurements are combined with the automorphism gates studied by Bravyi et al. (Nature 627, 778-782) to implement 288 Pauli product measurements. We demonstrate the practicality of our scheme through circuit-level noise simulations, leveraging a novel modular decoder that combines BPOSD with matching. The main technical contribution is a lower overhead logical measurement scheme based on gauge-fixing the construction by Cohen et al. (Sci. Adv. 8, eabn1717). Our techniques apply to general CSS codes and leverage expansion properties of the Tanner graph to give rigorous guarantees on qubit count, code distance, fault distance, and decoding distance of the modular decoder. In particular, we require $O(d/\beta)$ additional qubits where $\beta$ is the boundary Cheeger constant of the subgraph supporting the logical operator being measured. By introducing $O(d)$ additional bridge qubits, we are also able to measure products of logical Pauli operators and logical $Y$ operators.</description>

      <title>Identifying quantum resources in encoded computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is the origin of quantum computational advantage? Providing answers to this far-reaching question amounts to identifying the key properties, or quantum resources, that distinguish quantum computers from their classical counterparts, with direct applications to the development of quantum devices. The advent of universal quantum computers, however, relies on error-correcting codes to protect fragile logical quantum information by robustly encoding it into symmetric states of a quantum physical system. Such encodings make the task of resource identification more difficult, as what constitutes a resource from the logical and physical points of view can differ significantly. Here we introduce a general framework which allows us to correctly identify quantum resources in encoded computations, based on phase-space techniques. For a given quantum code, our construction provides a Wigner function that accounts for how the symmetries of the code space are contained within the transformations of the physical space, resulting in an object capable of describing the logical content of any physical state, both within and outside the code space. We illustrate our general construction with the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill encoding of qudits with odd dimension. The resulting Wigner function, which we call the Zak-Gross Wigner function, is shown to correctly identify quantum resources through its phase-space negativity. For instance, it is positive for encoded stabilizer states and negative for the bosonic vacuum. We further prove several properties, including that its negativity provides a measure of magic for the logical content of a state, and that its marginals are modular measurement distributions associated to conjugate Zak patches.</description>

      <title>Protecting entanglement witnesses with randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantum mechanics and serves as an essential resource in quantum information science. Therefore, the certification of entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing tasks. While entanglement witnesses are the most frequently used method for entanglement certification in experiments, recent research shows that even tiny errors in measurements may significantly undermine the effectiveness of a witness. In this work, we propose a randomized-measurement-based method to solve this problem. Through this method, the errors in measurement results can be substantially suppressed, thereby restoring the certification capability of entanglement witnesses. Our method is not only applicable to general types of witnesses, including multi-party entanglement and high-dimensional entanglement witnesses, but also experimentally friendly in the sense that only slight modifications are needed to the original measurement settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement in two-qubit systems using a geometric representation based on the minimum of essential parameters. The states are X-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of coherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the distance between the points that represent entangled states and the closest point that defines separable states. Our results give a geometric meaning to the Hill-Wootters concurrence C since L coincides with C. Furthermore, unlike C, the measure L distinguishes the rank of states with maximum entanglement. We construct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary components of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states share the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by the envelope of the minima of such entropy.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman's path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first, second and higher-order interference of classical and nonclassical light is interpreted in quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman\rq{}s path integral. Compared to the existed classical optical coherence theory based on Maxwell\rq{}s electromagnetic theory and Glauber\rq{}s quantum optical coherence theory based on wave mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics, quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman\rq{}s path integral provides a new tool to study optical coherence and has the advantage of understanding the connection between the physics and mathematical calculations. For instance, based on the results of transient first-order interference of two independent light beams, it is predicted that the well-accepted electric field model for thermal light introduced by many optical textbooks may not be accurate. The physics of two-photon bunching of thermal light and Hong-Ou-Mandel dip of entangled photon pairs is the same, which can be interpreted by constructive and destructive two-photon interference, respectively. The second-order interference of two independent light beams are introduced in detail. Interpreting the interference of light in quantum optical coherence theory based on Feynman\rq{}s path integral is helpful to understand the physics of light, and may eventually lead to the answer of the question puzzling us for a long time: what is photon?</description>

      <title>Non-chiral non-Bloch invariants and topological phase diagram in non-unitary quantum dynamics without chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Bloch topology leads to the emergence of various counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems under the open boundary condition (OBC), which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here by introducing the concept of non-chiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker's displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries and the non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Fast and Parallelizable Logical Computation with Homological Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary to perform large-scale quantum computation, but requires extremely large overheads in both space and time. High-rate quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC) codes promise a route to reduce qubit numbers, but performing computation while maintaining low space cost has required serialization of operations and extra time costs. In this work, we design fast and parallelizable logical gates for qLDPC codes, and demonstrate their utility for key algorithmic subroutines such as the quantum adder. Our gate gadgets utilize transversal logical CNOTs between a data qLDPC code and a suitably constructed ancilla code to perform parallel Pauli product measurements (PPMs) on the data logical qubits. For hypergraph product codes, we show that the ancilla can be constructed by simply modifying the base classical codes of the data code, achieving parallel PPMs on a subgrid of the logical qubits with a lower space-time cost than existing schemes for an important class of circuits. Generalizations to 3D and 4D homological product codes further feature fast PPMs in constant depth. While prior work on qLDPC codes has focused on individual logical gates, we initiate the study of fault-tolerant compilation with our expanded set of native qLDPC code operations, constructing algorithmic primitives for preparing $k$-qubit GHZ states and distilling/teleporting $k$ magic states with $O(1)$ space overhead in $O(1)$ and $O(\sqrt{k} \log k)$ logical cycles, respectively. We further generalize this to key algorithmic subroutines, demonstrating the efficient implementation of quantum adders using parallel operations. Our constructions are naturally compatible with reconfigurable architectures such as neutral atom arrays, paving the way to large-scale quantum computation with low space and time overheads.</description>

      <title>Another quantum version of Sanov theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to extend Sanov theorem to the quantum setting. Although a quantum version of the Sanov theorem was proposed in Bjelakovic et al (Commun. Math. Phys., 260, p.659 (2005)), the classical case of their statement is not the same as Sanov theorem because Sanov theorem discusses the behavior of the empirical distribution when the empirical distribution is different from the true distribution, but they studied a problem related to quantum hypothesis testing, whose classical version can be shown by classical Sanov theorem. We propose another quantum version of Sanov theorem by considering the quantum analog of the empirical distribution.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator in External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum harmonic oscillator subjected to an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach within the thermofield dynamics (TFD) framework, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and the external magnetic field. Our subsequent analysis reveals various features of this complexity. For instance, as temperature increases, the amplitude of complexity oscillations also rises, while at low temperatures, complexity stabilizes at a constant positive value. Furthermore, the magnetic field creates two distinct sectors: strong magnetic fields exhibit periodic complexity oscillations, whereas weak magnetic fields induce a beating effect. Finally, we confirm that the rate of complexity obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <title>Measuring a single atom's position with extreme sub-wavelength resolution and force measurements in the yoctonewton range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center-of-mass position of a single trapped atomic ion is measured and tracked in time with high precision. Employing a near-resonant radio frequency field of wavelength 2.37 cm and a static magnetic field gradient of 19 T/m, the spatial location of the ion is determined with an unprecedented wavelength-relative resolution of 5 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$, corresponding to an absolute precision of 0.12 nm. Measurements of an electrostatic force on a single ion demonstrate a sensitivity of 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{-23} ~\text{N}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. The real-time measurement of an atom's position complements the well-established technique of scanning near-field radio frequency transmission microscopy and opens up a novel route to using this method with path breaking spatial and force resolution.</description>

      <title>Q-gen: A Parameterized Quantum Circuit Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike most classical algorithms that take an input and give the solution directly as an output, quantum algorithms produce a quantum circuit that works as an indirect solution to computationally hard problems. In the full quantum computing workflow, most data processing remains in the classical domain except for running the quantum circuit in the quantum processor. This leaves massive opportunities for classical automation and optimization toward future utilization of quantum computing. We kickstart the first step in this direction by introducing Q-gen, a high-level, parameterized quantum circuit generator incorporating 15 realistic quantum algorithms. Each customized generation function comes with algorithm-specific parameters beyond the number of qubits, providing a large generation volume with high circuit variability. To demonstrate the functionality of Q-gen, we organize the algorithms into 5 hierarchical systems and generate a quantum circuit dataset accompanied by their measurement histograms and state vectors. This dataset enables researchers to statistically analyze the structure, complexity, and performance of large-scale quantum circuits, or quickly train novel machine learning models without worrying about the exponentially growing simulation time. Q-gen is an open-source and multipurpose project that serves as the entrance for users with a classical computer science background to dive into the world of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Vector Magnetometry Using Shallow Implanted NV Centers in Diamond with Waveguide-Assisted Dipole Excitation and Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip magnetic field sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond requires scalable integration of 3D waveguides into diamond substrates. Here, we develop a sensing array device with an ensemble of shallow implanted NV centers integrated with arrays of laser-written waveguides for excitation and readout of NV signals. Our approach enables an easy-to-operate on-chip magnetometer with a pixel size proportional to the Gaussian mode area of each waveguide. The performed continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance on each waveguide gives an average dc-sensitivity value of $195 \pm 3 {nT}/\sqrt{Hz}$, which can be improved with lock-in-detection or pulsed-microwave sequences. We apply a magnetic field to separate the four NV crystallographic orientations of the magnetic resonance and then utilize a DC current through a straight wire antenna close to the waveguide to prove the sensor capabilities of our device. We reconstruct the complete vector magnetic field in the NV crystal frame using three different NV crystallographic orientations. By knowing the polarization axis of the waveguide mode, we project the magnetic field vector into the lab frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meeting of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing is already a reality; quantum machine learning (QML) promises the design of better regression models. In this work, we extend our previous studies of materials discovery using classical active learning (AL), which showed remarkable economy of data, to explore the use of quantum algorithms within the AL framework (QAL) as implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses quantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor (QGPR) with various quantum kernels and different feature maps. Data sets include perovskite properties (piezoelectric coefficient, band gap, energy storage) and the structure optimization of a doped nanoparticle (3Al@Si11) chosen to compare with classical AL results. Our results revealed that the QAL method improved the searches in most cases, but not all, seemingly correlated with the roughness of the data. QAL has the potential of finding optimum solutions, within chemical space, in materials science and elsewhere in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Losses of Superconducting Qubits Strongly Coupled to Defect Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant contribution to the energy relaxation of state-of-the-art superconducting qubits is often attributed to their coupling to an ensemble of material defects which behave as two-level systems. These defects have varying microscopic characteristics which result in a large range of observable defect properties such as resonant frequencies, coherence times and coupling rates to qubits $g$. Here, we investigate strategies to mitigate losses to the family of defects that strongly couple to qubits ($g/2\pi\ge$ 0.5 MHz). Such strongly coupled defects are particularly detrimental to the coherence of qubits and to the fidelities of operations relying on frequency excursions, such as flux-activated two-qubit gates. To assess their impact, we perform swap spectroscopy on 92 frequency-tunable qubits and quantify the spectral density of these strongly coupled modes. We show that the frequency configuration of the defects is rearranged by warming up the sample to room temperature, whereas the total number of defects on a processor tends to remain constant. We then explore methods for fabricating qubits with a reduced number of strongly coupled defect modes by systematically measuring their spectral density for decreasing Josephson junction dimensions and for various surface cleaning methods. Our results provide insights into the properties of strongly coupled defect modes and show the benefits of minimizing Josephson junction dimensions to improve qubit properties.</description>

      <title>Methods to achieve near-millisecond energy relaxation and dephasing times for a superconducting transmon qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising physical systems for implementing a quantum computer. However, executing quantum algorithms of practical computational advantage requires further improvements in the fidelities of qubit operations, which are currently limited by the energy relaxation and dephasing times of the qubits. Here, we report our measurement results of a high-coherence transmon qubit with energy relaxation and echo dephasing times surpassing those in the existing literature. We measure a qubit frequency of 2.890 GHz, an energy relaxation time with a median of 502 us and a maximum of (765 +/- 82.6) us, and an echo dephasing time with a median of 541 us and a maximum of (1057 +/- 138) us. We report details of our design, fabrication process, and measurement setup to facilitate the reproduction and wide adoption of high-coherence transmon qubits in the academia and industry.</description>

      <title>Effect of group-velocity dispersion on the generation of multimode pulsed squeezed light in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal is a widely employed technique for generating quadrature squeezed light with multiple modes, which finds applications in quantum metrology, quantum information and communication. Here we study the generation of temporally multimode pulsed squeezed light in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating below the oscillation threshold, while considering the presence of non-compensated intracavity group-velocity dispersion. Based on the developed timedomain model of the system, we show that the dispersion results in mode-dependent detuning of the broadband supermodes of the pulsed parametric process from the cavity resonance, as well as linear coupling between these supermodes. With the perturbation theory up to the second order in the coupling coefficients between modes, we obtained a solution for the supermode amplitudes given an arbitrary number of modes and pump level. The dispersion affects the quantum state of the supermodes by influencing their squeezing level and the rotation of the squeezing ellipse. It also affects the entanglement among the supermodes, leading to reduced suppression of shot noise level as measured in the balanced homodyne detection scheme. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of SPOPO with group-velocity dispersion as a testbench for experimental investigations of multimode effects in linearly evanescent coupled parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Using stochastic resonance of two-level systems to increase qubit decoherence times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLS) are the major source of dephasing of spin qubits in numerous quantum computing platforms. In spite of much effort, it has been difficult to substantially mitigate the effects of this noise or, in many cases, to fully understand its physical origin. We propose a method to make progress on both of these issues. When an oscillating field is applied to a TLS, stochastic resonance can occur and the noise spectrum is moved to higher frequencies. This shift in the TLS noise spectrum will increase the dephasing times of the qubits that they influence. Furthermore, the details of this effect depend on the physical properties of the noise sources. Thus one can use qubit spectroscopy to investigate their physical properties, specifically the extent to which the TLS themselves possess quantum coherence. We find that it should be possible to determine the dephasing rate and the energy level separation of the TLS themselves in this way.</description>

      <title>Fast optical control of a coherent hole spin in a microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-photon interface is one of the key components of a quantum network. Physical platforms under investigation span the range of modern experimental physics, from ultra-cold atoms and ions to a variety of solid-state systems. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, typically with a trade-off between spin properties and photonic properties. Currently, the best deterministic single-photon sources use a semiconductor quantum dot embedded in an optical microcavity. However, coherent spin control has not yet been integrated with a state-of-the-art single-photon source, and the magnetic noise from host nuclear spins in the semiconductor environment has placed strong limitations on the spin coherence. Here, we combine high-fidelity all-optical spin control with a quantum dot in an open microcavity, currently the most efficient single-photon source platform available. By imprinting a microwave signal onto a red-detuned optical field, a Raman process, we demonstrate coherent rotations of a hole spin around an arbitrary axis of the Bloch sphere, achieving a maximum {\pi}-pulse fidelity of 98.6%. The cavity enhances the Raman process, enabling ultra-fast Rabi frequencies above 1 GHz. We use our flexible spin control to perform optical cooling of the nuclear spins in the host material via the central hole spin, extending the hole-spin coherence time T2* from 28 ns to 535 ns. Hahn echo preserves the spin coherence on a timescale of 20 {\mu}s, and dynamical decoupling extends the coherence close to the relaxation limit. Both the spin T2* and spin rotation time are much larger than the Purcell-enhanced radiative recombination time, 50 ps, enabling many spin-photon pairs to be created before the spin loses its coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate description of the interaction of a quantum system with a its environment is a challenging problem ubiquitous across all areas of physics, and lies at the foundation of quantum mechanics theory. Here we pioneer a new strategy to create discrete low-rank models of the system-environment interaction, by exploiting the frequency and time domain information encoded in the fluctuation-dissipation relation connecting the system-bath correlation function and the spectral density. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology by combining it with tensor-network methodologies and simulating the quantum dynamics of a complex excitonic systems in a highly structured bosonic environment. The new modeling framework sets the basis for a leap in the analysis of open quantum systems providing controlled accuracy at significantly reduced computational costs, with benefits in all connected research areas.</description>

      <title>Robust multi-mode superconducting qubit designed with evolutionary algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-mode superconducting circuits offer a promising platform for engineering robust systems for quantum computation. Previous studies have shown that single-mode devices cannot simultaneously exhibit resilience against multiple decoherence sources due to conflicting protection requirements. In contrast, multi-mode systems offer increased flexibility and have proven capable of overcoming these fundamental limitations. Nevertheless, exploring multi-mode architectures is computationally demanding due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension. Here, we present a multi-mode device designed using evolutionary optimization techniques, which have been shown to be effective for this computational task. The proposed device was optimized to feature an anharmonicity of a third of the qubit frequency and reduced energy dispersion caused by charge and magnetic flux fluctuations. It exhibits improvements over the fundamental errors limiting Transmon and Fluxonium coherence and manipulation, aiming for a balance between low depolarization error and fast manipulation; furthermore demonstrating robustness against fabrication errors, a major limitation in many proposed multi-mode devices. Overall, by striking a balance between coupling matrix elements and noise protection, we propose a device that paves the way towards finding proper characteristics for the construction of superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Behavior in the Boundary-obstructed Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonadiabatic dynamics of a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator when the system is slowly quenched across the boundary-obstructed phase transition, which is characterized by edge band gap closing.
  We find that the number of excitations produced after the quench exhibits power-law scaling behaviors with the quench rate. Boundary conditions can drastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be $\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\alpha=2$ for periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\alpha=1/2$ cannot be explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective dimension $d^{\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison, we also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase transitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with dimension $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Study of Topological Phenomena Through Berry Phase in Classical Nonlinear Elastic Granules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric of Berry phase concept, traditionally rooted in quantum mechanics, has been found to be increasingly significant in classical mechanics, particularly for understanding the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. In this study, we demonstrate the controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a classical system using a two-level time-dependent elastic bit, analogous to a quantum bit, within a nonlinear environment generated by a two-granular network. The nonlinearity of the granular beads is modulated through the frequency and amplitude of external harmonic excitation, along with static preloading. By employing the orthonormal basis of the nonlinear responses and mapping the displacement coefficients in Bloch states, we reveal how time influences the manipulation of the elastic bit and its states. Our analytical and experimental investigations uncover the Berry phase's role in exposing the various topological characteristics of the classical granular network. This research establishes a crucial link between classical and quantum realms via the Berry phase of an elastic bit, with significant implications for decoherence-free and robust data transfer and information processing.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter (D. Nakamura et al., arXiv:2407.09458), we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

This iteration of the experiment operated at millikelvin temperatures using a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) for reduced noise, along with various other upgrades over previous iterations. Covering the $25.45 - 26.27\,\mu\text{eV}$ ($6.15-6.35$ GHz) mass (frequency) range, this near-quantum limited phase of ORGAN employs a conducting rod resonator and a 7-T solenoidal magnet to place the most sensitive exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in the range to date, with $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \gtrsim 2.8\times10^{-13}$ at a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a metallic sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the experiment and theory by M. Liu \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021), where a non-local and lossless model for the graphene conductivity (GC) has been used and shown to be compatible with the experimental results. Recently, that conductivity model has been shown to be not correctly regularized [arXiv:2403.02279], to predict nonphysical results in the non-local regime, and being correct only in its local limit, where its expression is identical to the local Kubo conductivity model (once also losses are introduced). To compare the experimental results with the correctly regularized Kubo theory and to clarify the effective role played by the graphene non-locality and losses in that experiment, we calculated the CLF using three different models for the GC: the correct general non-local Kubo model, the local Kubo model, and the non-regularized and lossless model used by M. Liu \emph{et al.}. For the parameters of the experiment, the predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical, implying that, for the experiment, both non-local and lossy effects in the GC are negligible. This explains why the GC model used in M. Liu \emph{et al.} provides results in agreement with the experiment. We find that the experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions. Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atoms coupled to cavities provide an exciting playground for the study of fundamental interactions of atoms mediated through a common channel. Many of the applications of cavity-QED and cold-atom experiments more broadly, suffer from limitations caused by the transient nature of an atomic loading cycle. The development of continuous operation schemes is necessary to push these systems to the next level of performance. Here we present a machine designed to produce a continuous flux of collimated atoms that traverse an optical cavity. The atom-light interaction is enhanced by a fast-decaying cavity optimal for studying phenomena where atomic properties dominate. We demonstrate the transition to a collective strong coupling regime heralded by a normal-mode splitting. We observe a second phase with a binary normal-mode splitting born from an offset in the mean velocity of the atoms. Inverting the atomic ensemble in the collective strong coupling regime, we measure continuous optical gain. This work sets the stage for studying threshold conditions for continuous collective phenomena, such as continuous superradiant lasing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in long time, quantum trajectories select an invariant subspace of the Hilbert space of the system being indirectly measured. This selection is shown to be exponentially fast in an almost sure sense and in average. This result generalizes a known result for non demolition measurements to arbitrary repeated indirect measurements. Our proofs are based on the introduction of a deformation of the original instrument to an equivalent one with a unique invariant state.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Quantum Non-local Neural Network for Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-local operations play a crucial role in computer vision enabling the capture of long-range dependencies through weighted sums of features across the input, surpassing the constraints of traditional convolution operations that focus solely on local neighborhoods. Non-local operations typically require computing pairwise relationships between all elements in a set, leading to quadratic complexity in terms of time and memory. Due to the high computational and memory demands, scaling non-local neural networks to large-scale problems can be challenging. This article introduces a hybrid quantum-classical scalable non-local neural network, referred to as Quantum Non-Local Neural Network (QNL-Net), to enhance pattern recognition. The proposed QNL-Net relies on inherent quantum parallelism to allow the simultaneous processing of a large number of input features enabling more efficient computations in quantum-enhanced feature space and involving pairwise relationships through quantum entanglement. We benchmark our proposed QNL-Net with other quantum counterparts to binary classification with datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. The simulation findings showcase our QNL-Net achieves cutting-edge accuracy levels in binary image classification among quantum classifiers while utilizing fewer qubits.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the Standard Quantum Limit using an Optical Spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics places noise limits and sensitivity restrictions on physical measurements. The balance between unwanted backaction and the precision of optical measurements impose a standard quantum limit (SQL) on interferometric systems. In order to realize a sensitivity below the SQL, it is necessary to leverage a back-action evading measurement technique, or else exploit cancellations of any excess noise contributions at the detector. %Many proof of principle experiments have been performed, but only recently has an experiment achieved sensitivity below the SQL. In this work, we extend that initial demonstration and realize sub-SQL measurement sensitivity nearly two times better than previous measurements, and with architecture applicable to interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In fact, this technique is directly applicable to Advanced LIGO, which could observe similar effects with a detuned signal recycling cavity. By exploiting quantum correlations created by an optical spring, we measure a total sensitivity below the SQL by $\textbf{2.8}$ dB, corresponding to a reduction in the noise power by $\textbf{72}\pm\textbf{5.1}$ \% below the quantum limit. Through the use of a detuned optical spring, this noise reduction is tunable, allowing us to choose the desired range of frequencies that fall below the SQL. This result demonstrates access to sensitivities well below the SQL at frequencies ranges applicable to LIGO, with the potential to extend the reach of gravitational wave detectors further into the universe.</description>

      <title>Protecting Expressive Circuits with a Quantum Error Detection Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A successful quantum error correction protocol would allow quantum computers to run algorithms without suffering from the effects of noise. However, fully fault-tolerant quantum error correction is too resource intensive for existing quantum computers. In this context we develop a quantum error detection code for implementations on existing trapped-ion computers. By encoding $k$ logical qubits into $k+2$ physical qubits, this code presents fault-tolerant state initialisation and syndrome measurement circuits that can detect any single-qubit error. It provides a universal set of local and global logical rotations that have physical support on only two qubits. A high-fidelity -- though non fault-tolerant -- compilation of this universal gate set is possible thanks to the two-qubit physical rotations present in trapped-ion computers with all-to-all connectivity. Given the particular structure of the logical operators, we nickname it the Iceberg code. We demonstrate the protection of circuits of 8 logical qubits with up to 256 layers, saturate the logical quantum volume of $2^8$, and show the positive effect of increasing the frequency of syndrome measurements within the circuit. These results illustrate the practical usefulness of the Iceberg code to protect expressive circuits on existing trapped-ion quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Learning physical properties of high-dimensional states is crucial for developing quantum technologies but usually consumes an exceedingly large number of samples which are difficult to afford in practice. In this Letter, we use the methodology of quantum metrology to tackle this difficulty, proposing a strategy built upon entangled measurements for dramatically reducing sample complexity. The strategy, whose characteristic feature is symmetrization of observables, is powered by the exploration of symmetric structures of states which are ubiquitous in physics. It is provably optimal under some natural assumption, efficiently implementable in a variety of contexts, and capable of being incorporated into existing methods as a basic building block. We apply the strategy to different scenarios motivated by experiments, demonstrating exponential reductions in sample complexity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum oscillators with nonlinear driving and dissipative terms have gained significant attention due to their ability to stabilize cat-states for universal quantum computation. Recently, superconducting circuits have been employed to realize such long-lived qubits stored in coherent states. We present a generalization of these oscillators, which are not limited to coherent states, in the presence of different nonlinearities in driving and dissipation, exploring different degrees. Specifically, we present an extensive analysis of the asymptotic dynamical features and of the storage of squeezed states. We demonstrate that coherent superpositions of squeezed states are achievable in the presence of a strong symmetry, thereby allowing for the storage of squeezed cat-states. In the weak symmetry regime, accounting for linear dissipation, we investigate the potential application of these nonlinear driven-dissipative resonators for quantum computing and quantum associative memory and analyze the impact of squeezing on their performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems in thermal equilibrium are described using Gibbs states. The correlations in such states determine how difficult it is to describe or simulate them. In this article, we show that if the Gibbs state of a quantum system satisfies that each of its marginals admits a local effective Hamiltonian with short-range interactions, then it satisfies a mixing condition, that is, for any regions $A$, $C$ the distance of the reduced state $\rho_{AC}$ on these regions to the product of its marginals,
  $$\| \rho_{AC} \rho_A^{-1} \otimes \rho_C^{-1} - 1_{AC}\|\, ,$$
  decays exponentially with the distance between regions $A$ and $C$. This mixing condition is stronger than other commonly studied measures of correlation. In particular, it implies the exponential decay of the mutual information between distant regions. The mixing condition has been used, for example, to prove positive log-Sobolev constants. On the way, we prove that the the condition regarding local effective Hamiltonian is satisfied if the Hamiltonian of the system is commuting and also commutes with every marginal of the Gibbs state. The proof of these results employs a variety of tools such as Araki's expansionals, quantum belief propagation and cluster expansions.</description>

Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 28-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.21 ns and 2.86 ns.</description>

Abstract: From the ancient Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox to the recent Sorkin-type impossible measurements problem, the contradictions between relativistic causality, quantum non-locality, and quantum measurement have persisted. Based on quantum field theory, our work provides a framework that harmoniously integrates these three aspects. This framework consists of causality expressed by reduced density matrices and an interpretation of quantum mechanics that considers quantum mechanics to be complete. Specifically, we use reduced density matrices to represent the local information of the quantum state and show that the reduced density matrices cannot evolve superluminally. Unlike recent approaches that focus on causality by introducing new operators to describe detectors, we consider that everything--including detectors, environments, and humans--is composed of the same fundamental fields, which prompts us to question the validity of the derivation of Schrodinger's cat paradox and leads us to propose an interpretation of quantum mechanics that does not require any additional assumptions and is compatible with relativity.</description>

Abstract: We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric, which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic physics.</description>

Abstract: Routing problems are a common optimization problem in industrial applications, which occur on a large scale in supply chain planning. Due to classical limitations for solving NP-hard problems, quantum computing hopes to improve upon speed or solution quality. Several suggestions have been made for encodings of routing problems to solve them with variational quantum algorithms. However, for an end user it is hard to decide a priori which encoding will give the best solutions according to their needs. In this work, we investigate different encodings for the Travelling Salesperson Problem. We compare their scaling and performance when using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and provide a clear guide for users when to choose which encoding. For small instances, we find evidence that the permutation encoding can yield good results since it does not suffer from feasibility issues.</description>

      <title>Interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement in many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence is intrinsically related to projective measurement. When the fixed projective measurement involves higher-rank projectors, the coherence resource is referred to as block coherence, which comes from the superposition of orthogonal subspaces. Here, we establish a set of quantitative relations for the interconversion between block coherence and multipartite entanglement under the framework of the block-incoherent operations. It is found that the converted multipartite entanglement is upper bounded by the initial block coherence of single-party system. Moreover, the generated multipartite entanglement can be transferred to its subsystems and restored to block coherence of the initial single-party system by means of local block-incoherent operations and classical communication. In addition, when only the coarse-grained quantum operations are accessible for the ancillary subsystems, we further demonstrate that a lossless resource interconversion is still realizable, and give a concrete example in three four-level systems. Our results provide a versatile approach to utilize different quantum resources in a cyclic fashion.</description>

Abstract: A path integral method, combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, has been developed to calculate thermal quantum expectation values using a classical approach. In this study, we show how to treat Hamiltonians with non-linear terms, that are relevant for describing uniaxial anisotropies and mechanical constraints. These interactions can be expressed solely through quadratic terms of the spin operator along one axis, that can be identified with the quantisation axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of both squeezed photons and thermal photons on entanglement dynamics is observed. The main feature of the double Jaynes-Cummings model - entanglement sudden death is observed for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum gates are essential components for optical quantum information processing. However, the efficient implementation of practically important multi-mode higher-order non-Gaussian gates has not been comprehensively studied. We propose a measurement-based method to directly implement general, multi-mode, and higher-order non-Gaussian gates using only fixed non-Gaussian ancillary states and adaptive linear optics. Compared to existing methods, our method allows for a more resource-efficient and experimentally feasible implementation of multi-mode gates that are important for various applications in optical quantum technology, such as the two-mode cubic quantum non-demolition gate or the three-mode continuous-variable Toffoli gate, and their higher-order extensions. Our results will expedite the progress toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computing with light.</description>

Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which links the uncertainties of the position and momentum of a particle, has an important footprint on the quantum behavior of a physical system. Motivated by this principle, we propose that thermodynamic currents associated with work, heat, and internal energy are described by well-defined Hermitian operators; i.e., we associate physical observables to quantum thermodynamic flows. The observables are defined such that their expectation values match the average values of the associated currents. These rates, or currents, differ from their classical counterparts due to the non-commutativity of the corresponding operators. Using the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation, we then obtain various thermodynamic uncertainty relationships between them. In particular, we connect the fluctuations in heat rate and thermodynamic power with those in internal energy. We further illustrate this approach by applying it to quantum batteries, where we derive an energy-power uncertainty relationship and show how measurements affect the fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.</description>

      <title>Third-order Pertubative OTOC of Harmonic Oscillator with Quartic Interaction and Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the third order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with extra quartic interaction by the second quantization method. We obtain the analytic relations of spectrum, Fock space states and matrix elements of coordinate which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We see that OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, i.e. $C_T(\infty)\to 2\langle x^2\rangle_T\langle p^2\rangle_T$, which associates with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze early-time property of $C_T$ and see that the exponential growth, which diagnoses the chaos, is shown in the third-order perturbation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum finite automata (QFAs) have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we define and systematically study quantum B\"uchi automata (QBAs) over infinite words to model the long-term behavior of quantum systems, which extend QFAs. We introduce the classes of $\omega$-languages recognized by QBAs in probable, almost sure, strict and non-strict threshold semantics. Several pumping lemmas and closure properties for QBAs are proved. Some decision problems for QBAs are investigated. In particular, we show that there are surprisingly only at most four substantially different classes of $\omega$-languages recognized by QBAs (out of uncountably infinite). The relationship between classical $\omega$-languages and QBAs is clarified using our pumping lemmas. We also find an $\omega$-language recognized by QBAs under the almost sure semantics, which is not $\omega$-context-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting mixtures of bosons and fermions are ubiquitous in nature. They form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for understanding quantum materials and are of technological importance in helium dilution refrigerators. However, the description of their coupled thermodynamics and collective behaviour is challenging. Bose-Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms provide a platform to investigate their properties in a highly controllable environment, where the species concentration and interaction strength can be tuned at will. Here we characterize the collective oscillations of spin-polarized fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the interaction strength and temperature. For strong interactions, the Fermi gas perfectly mimics the superfluid hydrodynamic modes of the condensate, from low-energy quadrupole modes to high-order Faraday excitations. With an increasing number of bosonic thermal excitations, the dynamics of the impurities cross over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional electron fluids.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein Condensation with Engineered Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. In previous work, a theory was developed that predicts, in which states a driven-dissipative ideal Bose gas condenses. Here, we address the inverse problem: Given a target state with desired condensate fractions in certain single-particle states, how can this configuration be achieved by tuning available control parameters? Which type of experimental setup allows for flexible condensation control? We solve these problems, on the one hand, by proposing a Bose `condenser', experimentally implementable in a superconducting circuit, where targeted Bose condensation into eigenstates of a chain of resonators is driven through the coupling to artificial quantum baths, realized via auxiliary two-level systems. On the other, we develop a theory to solve the inverse problem based on linear programming methods. We further discuss the engineering of transition points between different Bose condensation configurations, which may find application for amplification, heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured quantum baths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09402v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with system size, the simulation of quantum many-body systems has remained a persistent challenge until today. Here, we review a relatively new class of variational states for the simulation of such systems, namely neural quantum states (NQS), which overcome the exponential scaling by compressing the state in terms of the network parameters rather than storing all exponentially many coefficients needed for an exact parameterization of the state. We introduce the commonly used NQS architectures and their various applications for the simulation of ground and excited states, finite temperature and open system states as well as NQS approaches to simulate the dynamics of quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss NQS in the context of quantum state tomography.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium quantum heat transport between structured environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the $\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties of thermal environments.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>
