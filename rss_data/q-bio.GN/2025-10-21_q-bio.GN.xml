      <title>AGNES: Adaptive Graph Neural Network and Dynamic Programming Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Nanopore Seed Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</description>

      <title>Identifying multi-omics interactions for lung cancer drug targets discovery using Kernel Machine Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer exhibits diverse and complex phenotypes driven by multifaceted molecular interactions. Recent biomedical research has emphasized the comprehensive study of such diseases by integrating multi-omics datasets (genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome). This approach provides an efficient method for identifying genetic variants associated with cancer and offers a deeper understanding of how the disease develops and spreads. However, it is challenging to comprehend complex interactions among the features of multi-omics datasets compared to single omics. In this paper, we analyze lung cancer multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using four statistical methods, LIMMA, the T test, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and the Wilcoxon test, we identified differentially expressed genes across gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We then integrated these multi-omics data using the Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) approach. Our findings reveal significant interactions among the three omics: gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. Among these, eight genes of highest ranking (PDGFRB, PDGFRA, SNAI1, ID1, FGF11, TNXB, ITGB1, ZIC1) were highlighted by rigorous statistical analysis. Furthermore, in silico studies identified three top-ranked potential candidate drugs (Selinexor, Orapred, and Capmatinib) that could play a crucial role in the treatment of lung cancer. These proposed drugs are also supported by the findings of other independent studies, which underscore their potential efficacy in the fight against lung cancer.</description>

      <title>Phenome-Wide Multi-Omics Integration Uncovers Distinct Archetypes of Human Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12384</link>

Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.</description>

      <title>Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</description>
