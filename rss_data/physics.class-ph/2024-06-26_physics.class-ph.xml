      <title>A No-Go Theorem of Analytical Mechanics for the Second Law Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>

      <title>EMVD dataset: a dataset of extreme vocal distortion techniques used in heavy metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Extreme Metal Vocals Dataset, which comprises a collection of recordings of extreme vocal techniques performed within the realm of heavy metal music. The dataset consists of 760 audio excerpts of 1 second to 30 seconds long, totaling about 100 min of audio material, roughly composed of 60 minutes of distorted voices and 40 minutes of clear voice recordings. These vocal recordings are from 27 different singers and are provided without accompanying musical instruments or post-processing effects. The distortion taxonomy within this dataset encompasses four distinct distortion techniques and three vocal effects, all performed in different pitch ranges. Performance of a state-of-the-art deep learning model is evaluated for two different classification tasks related to vocal techniques, demonstrating the potential of this resource for the audio processing community.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of the Recoil Force Acting on a Leaking Water Tank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the article, we will outline the paradoxical picture that arises when attempting to calculate the recoil force of the water leakage from a hole at the bottom of a water tank. We will present three different options for the recoil force acting on the water tank as a result of this leakage (in Chapters 1, 2 and 3). In the second part of the article, we will present an experiment that resolves this question (in Chapter 4). Finally (in Chapter 5), we will present a coherent picture of the description of the leakage and the result recoil force.</description>
