      <title>Harmonizing vs Polarizing Platform Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of opinion formation on social networking platforms, focusing on how individual opinions, influenced by both social connections and platform algorithms, evolve. We model this process using a differential equation, accounting for both peer influence and the platform's content curation based on user preferences. Our primary aim is to analyze how these factors contribute to opinion polarization and identify potential strategies for its mitigation. We explore the conditions under which opinions converge to a consensus or remain polarized, emphasizing the role of the platform's influence function. Our findings in two-agent, complete graphs, and stochastic block model provide insights into the impact of social media algorithms on public discourse and offer a framework for understanding how polarization can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning for Implicit Social Factors in Social Media Popularity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On social media sharing platforms, some posts are inherently destined for popularity. Therefore, understanding the reasons behind this phenomenon and predicting popularity before post publication holds significant practical value. The previous work predominantly focuses on enhancing post content extraction for better prediction results. However, certain factors introduced by social platforms also impact post popularity, which has not been extensively studied. For instance, users are more likely to engage with posts from individuals they follow, potentially influencing the popularity of these posts. We term these factors, unrelated to the explicit attractiveness of content, as implicit social factors. Through the analysis of users' post browsing behavior (also validated in public datasets), we propose three implicit social factors related to popularity, including content relevance, user influence similarity, and user identity. To model the proposed social factors, we introduce three supervised contrastive learning tasks. For different task objectives and data types, we assign them to different encoders and control their gradient flows to achieve joint optimization. We also design corresponding sampling and augmentation algorithms to improve the effectiveness of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on the Social Media Popularity Dataset validate the superiority of our proposed method and also confirm the important role of implicit social factors in popularity prediction. We open source the code at https://github.com/Daisy-zzz/PPCL.git.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bipartite Graph Embedding Induced by Clustering Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite graph embedding (BGE) maps nodes to compressed embedding vectors that can reflect the hidden topological features of the network, and learning high-quality BGE is crucial for facilitating downstream applications such as recommender systems. However, most existing methods either struggle to efficiently learn embeddings suitable for users and items with fewer interactions, or exhibit poor scalability to handle large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a Clustering Constraints induced BIpartite graph Embedding (CCBIE) as an integrated solution to both problems. CCBIE facilitates automatic and dynamic soft clustering of items in a top-down manner, and capturing macro-preference information of users through clusters. Specifically, by leveraging the cluster embedding matrix of items, CCBIE calculates the cluster assignment matrix for items and also captures the extent of user preferences across different clusters, thereby elucidating the similarity between users and items on a macro-scale level. CCBIE effectively preserves the global properties of bipartite graphs, maintaining the cluster structure of isomorphic nodes and accounting for long-range dependencies among heterogeneous nodes. Our approach significantly enhances user-item collaborative relation modeling by integrating adaptive clustering for relationship learning, thereby markedly improving prediction performance, particularly benefiting cold users and items. Extensive experiments indicate that CCBIE consistently and significantly improves accuracy over baseline models, particularly on sparse graphs, while also enhancing training speed and reducing memory requirements on large-scale bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Incentivized Network Dynamics in Digital Job Recruitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms have transformed the formal job market but continue to struggle with effectively engaging passive candidates-individuals not actively seeking employment but open to compelling opportunities. We introduce the Independent Halting Cascade (IHC) model, a novel framework that integrates complex network diffusion dynamics with economic game theory to address this challenge. Unlike traditional models that focus solely on information propagation, the IHC model empowers network agents to either disseminate a job posting or halt its spread by applying for the position themselves. By embedding economic incentives into agent decision-making processes, the model creates a dynamic interplay between maximizing information spread and promoting application. Our analysis uncovers distinct behavioral regimes within the IHC model, characterized by critical thresholds in recommendation and application probabilities. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and real-world network topologies demonstrate that the IHC model significantly outperforms traditional direct-recommendation systems in recruiting suitable passive candidates. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 30% higher hiring success rate compared to baseline methods. These findings offer strategic insights into leveraging economic incentives and network structures to enhance recruitment efficiency. The IHC model thus provides a robust framework for modernizing recruitment strategies, particularly in engaging the vast pool of passive candidates in the job market.</description>

      <title>A Personalized MOOC Learning Group and Course Recommendation Method Based on Graph Neural Network and Social Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to enhance students' initiative and participation in MOOC learning, this study constructed a multi-level network model based on Social Network Analysis (SNA). The model makes use of data pertaining to nearly 40,000 users and tens of thousands of courses from various higher education MOOC platforms. Furthermore, an AI-based assistant has been developed which utilises the collected data to provide personalised recommendations regarding courses and study groups for students. The objective is to examine the relationship between students' course selection preferences and their academic interest levels. Based on the results of the relationship analysis, the AI assistant employs technologies such as GNN to recommend suitable courses and study groups to students. This study offers new insights into the potential of personalised teaching on MOOC platforms, demonstrating the value of data-driven and AI-assisted methods in improving the quality of online learning experiences, increasing student engagement, and enhancing learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>BANGS: Game-Theoretic Node Selection for Graph Self-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph self-training is a semi-supervised learning method that iteratively selects a set of unlabeled data to retrain the underlying graph neural network (GNN) model and improve its prediction performance. While selecting highly confident nodes has proven effective for self-training, this pseudo-labeling strategy ignores the combinatorial dependencies between nodes and suffers from a local view of the distribution. To overcome these issues, we propose BANGS, a novel framework that unifies the labeling strategy with conditional mutual information as the objective of node selection. Our approach -- grounded in game theory -- selects nodes in a combinatorial fashion and provides theoretical guarantees for robustness under noisy objective. More specifically, unlike traditional methods that rank and select nodes independently, BANGS considers nodes as a collective set in the self-training process. Our method demonstrates superior performance and robustness across various datasets, base models, and hyperparameter settings, outperforming existing techniques. The codebase is available on https://github.com/fangxin-wang/BANGS .</description>

      <title>A Fully-dynamic Approximation Algorithm for Maximum Weight b-Matchings in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching nodes in a graph G = (V, E) is a well-studied algorithmic problem with many applications. The b-matching problem is a generalizati on that allows to match a node with up to b neighbors. This allows more flexible connectivity patterns whenever vertices may have multiple associations. The algorithm b-suitor [Khan et al., SISC2016] is able to compute a (1/2)-approximation of a maximum weight b-matching in O(|E|) time. Since real-world graphs often change over time, fast dynamic methods for b-matching optimization are desirable. In this work, we propose Dyn-b-suitor, a dynamic algorithm for the weighted b-matching problem. As a non-trivial extension to the dynamic Suitor algorithm for 1-matchings [Angriman et al., JEA 2022], our approach computes (1/2)-approximate b-matchings by identifying and updating affected vertices without static recomputation. Our proposed algorithm is fully-dynamic, i. e., it supports both edge insertions and deletions, and we prove that it computes the same solution as its static counterpart.
  In extensive experiments on real-world benchmark graphs and generated instances, our dynamic algorithm yields significant savings compared to the sequential b-suitor, e. g., for batch updates with $10^3$ edges with an average acceleration factor of $10^3$. When comparing our sequential dynamic algorithm with the parallel (static) b-suitor on a 128-core machine, our dynamic algorithm is still $59$x to $10^4$ faster.</description>

      <title>Causal Modeling of Climate Activism on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate activism is crucial in stimulating collective societal and behavioral change towards sustainable practices through political pressure. Although multiple factors contribute to the participation in activism, their complex relationships and the scarcity of data on their interactions have restricted most prior research to studying them in isolation, thus preventing the development of a quantitative, causal understanding of why people approach activism. In this work, we develop a comprehensive causal model of how and why Reddit users engage with activist communities driving mass climate protests (mainly the 2019 Earth Strike, Fridays for Future, and Extinction Rebellion). Our framework, based on Stochastic Variational Inference applied to Bayesian Networks, learns the causal pathways over multiple time periods. Distinct from previous studies, our approach uses large-scale and fine-grained longitudinal data (2016 to 2022) to jointly model the roles of sociodemographic makeup, experience of extreme weather events, exposure to climate-related news, and social influence through online interactions. We find that among users interested in climate change, participation in online activist communities is indeed influenced by direct interactions with activists and largely by recent exposure to media coverage of climate protests. Among people aware of climate change, left-leaning people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are particularly represented in online activist groups. Our findings offer empirical validation for theories of media influence and critical mass, and lay the foundations to inform interventions and future studies to foster public participation in collective action.</description>

      <title>Quantifying metadata relevance to network block structure using description length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network analysis is often enriched by including an examination of node metadata. In the context of understanding the mesoscale of networks it is often assumed that node groups based on metadata and node groups based on connectivity patterns are intrinsically linked. This assumption is increasingly being challenged, whereby metadata might be entirely unrelated to structure or, similarly, multiple sets of metadata might be relevant to the structure of a network in different ways. We propose the metablox tool to quantify the relationship between a network's node metadata and its mesoscale structure, measuring the strength of the relationship and the type of structural arrangement exhibited by the metadata. We show on a number of synthetic and empirical networks that our tool distinguishes relevant metadata and allows for this in a comparative setting, demonstrating that it can be used as part of systematic meta analyses for the comparison of networks from different domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book collects the lectures about graph theory and its applications which were given to students of mathematical departments of Moscow State University and Peking University. Graph theory is a very wide field with a lot of applications in almost every scientific area: in many branches of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and also in psychology, arts, philosophy and many others. Nowadays, graph theory becomes especially more important because of the rapid development of molecular biology, neural networks and AI fields. One of the aims of writing this book was to give students thorough knowledge about graphs to understand modern scientific fields more deeply. Here we tried to give classical and modern theorems and algorithms in more understandable and simple way. We spent many time to rewrite them and close the gaps in several simplest well-known proofs to provide more precise and accurate material for students.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Change Point Detection using Adapted Cardinality-Based Gadgets: Applications in Dynamic Legal Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a robust framework for modeling complex systems with higher-order interactions. However, analyzing them in dynamic settings presents significant computational challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel method that adapts the cardinality-based gadget to convert hypergraphs into strongly connected weighted directed graphs, complemented by a symmetrized combinatorial Laplacian. We demonstrate that the harmonic mean of the conductance and edge expansion of the original hypergraph can be upper-bounded by the conductance of the transformed directed graph, effectively preserving crucial cut information. Additionally, we analyze how the resulting Laplacian relates to that derived from the star expansion. Our approach was validated through change point detection experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, showing superior performance over clique and star expansions in maintaining spectral information in dynamic settings. Finally, we applied our method to analyze a dynamic legal hypergraph constructed from extensive United States court opinion data.</description>

      <title>Urban Anomalies: A Simulated Human Mobility Dataset with Injected Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human mobility anomaly detection based on location is essential in areas such as public health, safety, welfare, and urban planning. Developing models and approaches for location-based anomaly detection requires a comprehensive dataset. However, privacy concerns and the absence of ground truth hinder the availability of publicly available datasets. With this paper, we provide extensive simulated human mobility datasets featuring various anomaly types created using an existing Urban Patterns of Life Simulation. To create these datasets, we inject changes in the logic of individual agents to change their behavior. Specifically, we create four of anomalous agent behavior by (1) changing the agents' appetite (causing agents to have meals more frequently), (2) changing their group of interest (causing agents to interact with different agents from another group). (3) changing their social place selection (causing agents to visit different recreational places) and (4) changing their work schedule (causing agents to skip work), For each type of anomaly, we use three degrees of behavioral change to tune the difficulty of detecting the anomalous agents. To select agents to inject anomalous behavior into, we employ three methods: (1) Random selection using a centralized manipulation mechanism, (2) Spread based selection using an infectious disease model, and (3) through exposure of agents to a specific location. All datasets are split into normal and anomalous phases. The normal phase, which can be used for training models of normalcy, exhibits no anomalous behavior. The anomalous phase, which can be used for testing for anomalous detection algorithm, includes ground truth labels that indicate, for each five-minute simulation step, which agents are anomalous at that time. Datasets are generated using the maps (roads and buildings) for Atlanta and Berlin, having 1k agents in each simulation.</description>

      <title>Pure Message Passing Can Estimate Common Neighbor for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the {\em de facto} standard in graph representation learning. However, when it comes to link prediction, they often struggle, surpassed by simple heuristics such as Common Neighbor (CN). This discrepancy stems from a fundamental limitation: while MPNNs excel in node-level representation, they stumble with encoding the joint structural features essential to link prediction, like CN. To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. Moreover, our approach demonstrates that leveraging message-passing to capture structural features could offset MPNNs' expressiveness limitations at the expense of estimation variance. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Decoding Susceptibility: Modeling Misbelief to Misinformation Through a Computational Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Susceptibility to misinformation describes the degree of belief in unverifiable claims, a latent aspect of individuals' mental processes that is not observable. Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous research, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed domain, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent modeling approach. Furthermore, we apply our model to annotate susceptibility scores on a large-scale dataset and analyze the relationships between susceptibility with various factors. Our analysis reveals that political leanings and psychological factors exhibit varying degrees of association with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation.</description>

      <title>Compression-based inference of network motif sets</title>

Abstract: Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred as "building blocks of complex networks". Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enables the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. The statistical inference of network motifs is however fraught with difficulties, from defining and sampling the right null model to accounting for the large number of possible motifs and their potential correlations in statistical testing. Here we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. The minimum description length principle allows us to select the most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. The approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on a priori specification of an appropriate null model. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which guarantees more robust statistical inference. Our approach overcomes the common problems in classic testing-based motif analysis. We apply our methodology to perform comparative connectomics by evaluating the compressibility and the circuit motifs of a range of synaptic-resolution neural connectomes.</description>

      <title>Network mutual information measures for graph similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of tasks in network analysis, such as clustering network populations or identifying anomalies in temporal graph streams, require a measure of the similarity between two graphs. To provide a meaningful data summary for downstream scientific analyses, the graph similarity measures used for these tasks must be principled, interpretable, and capable of distinguishing meaningful overlapping network structure from statistical noise at different scales of interest. Here we derive a family of graph mutual information measures that satisfy these criteria and are constructed using only fundamental information theoretic principles. Our measures capture the information shared among networks according to different encodings of their structural information, with our mesoscale mutual information measure allowing for network comparison under any specified network coarse-graining. We test our measures in a range of applications on real and synthetic network data, finding that they effectively highlight intuitive aspects of network similarity across scales in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Five Years of COVID-19 Discourse on Instagram: A Labeled Instagram Dataset of Over Half a Million Posts for Multilingual Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work presented in this paper makes three scientific contributions with a specific focus on mining and analysis of COVID-19-related posts on Instagram. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID-19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages as well as 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, it presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35% to 28.69%, while neutral sentiment rising from 44.19% to 58.34%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68% were positive, 14.84% were negative, and 35.48% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40% were positive, 57.04% were negative, and 38.56% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.</description>

      <title>Who should fight the spread of fake news?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates who should bear the responsibility of combating the spread of misinformation in social networks. Should that be the online platforms or their users? Should that be done by debunking the "fake news" already in circulation or by investing in preemptive efforts to prevent their diffusion altogether? We seek to answer such questions in a stylized opinion dynamics framework, where agents in a network aggregate the information they receive from peers and/or from influential external sources, with the aim of learning a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses. In most cases, we find centralized sources to be more effective at combating misinformation than distributed ones, suggesting that online platforms should play an active role in the fight against fake news. In line with literature on the "backfire effect", we find that debunking in certain circumstances can be a counterproductive strategy, whereas some targeted strategies (akin to "deplatforming") and/or preemptive campaigns turn out to be quite effective. Despite its simplicity, our model provides useful guidelines that could inform the ongoing debate on online disinformation and the best ways to limit its damaging effects.</description>
