      <title>Temporarily quiescent galaxies at cosmic dawn: probing bursty star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bursty, time-variable nature of star formation in the first billion years, as revealed by JWST, drives phases of temporary quiescence in low-mass galaxies that quench after starbursts. These galaxies provide unique probes of the burstiness of early star formation and its underlying physical processes. Using the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulations, we analyze over 200 galaxies with $M_\star&lt;10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6-8$, finding that most experience quiescent phases driven by stellar feedback, with minimal influence from environmental effects. The fraction of temporarily quiescent galaxies increases with decreasing mass and luminosity, representing the dominant population at $M_\star&lt;10^8\rm M_\odot$ and $M_{UV}&gt;-17$. By forward modeling their spectral energy distributions, we show that they are faint ($\langle M_{UV}\rangle = -15.6$ for $M_\star=10^{8}\rm M_\odot$), have strong Balmer breaks ($&gt; 0.5$) and no emission lines. Comparing our predicted fractions with JWST results, we find similar luminosity-dependent trends; however, the observed fractions of temporarily quiescent galaxies at $M_{UV}\sim-20$ to $-19$ are higher, suggesting that stronger feedback or additional mechanisms beyond supernovae may be at play. We propose searching for F200W drop-outs and satellites in the proximity ($&lt;5^{\prime\prime}$) of massive ($&gt;10^{10}\rm M_\odot$) galaxies as effective strategies to uncover the hidden majority of faint ($M_{UV}&gt;-17$), temporarily quiescent systems, crucial for constraining early feedback processes in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and most luminous stellar systems in the Universe, offering unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. While the physical processes behind their origin have long remained elusive, major theoretical and observational developments in the past decade have led to a new understanding of GCs as the natural outcome of high-pressure star formation in high-redshift galaxies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in our understanding of GC formation and aims to provide a comprehensive point of reference for leveraging the revolutionary capabilities of the current and upcoming generation of telescopes. The latest generation of GC models combine our understanding of their formation and destruction with advanced galaxy formation simulations. The next decade will provide the first-ever opportunity to test such models across their full evolutionary history, from GC formation at high redshift as seen with the James Webb Telescope, to snapshots of GC demographics at intermediate redshifts obtained with 30m-class telescopes, and eventually to the well-characterized GC populations observed at the present day. We identify the major questions that we should expect to address this way.</description>

      <title>The Role of Pressure in the Structure and Stability of GMCs in the Andromeda Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the role of pressure in the structure, stability and confinement of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in light of recently published observations and analysis of the GMCs in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). That analysis showed, that in the absence of any external pressure, most GMCs (57\% by number) in M31 would be gravitationally unbound. Here, after a more detailed examination of the global measurements of surface densities and velocity dispersions, we find that GMCs in M31, when they can be traced to their outermost boundaries, require external pressures for confinement that are consistent with estimates for the mid-plane pressure of this galaxy. We introduce and apply a novel methodology to measure the radial profile of internal pressure within any GMC that is spatially resolved by the CO observations. We show that for the best resolved examples in M31 the internal pressures increase steeply with surface density in a power-law fashion with $p_{int} \sim \Sigma^2$. At high surface densities many of these extragalactic GMCs break from the single power-law and exhibit upward curvature. Both these characteristics of the variation of internal pressure with surface density are in agreement with theoretical expectations for hydrostatic equilibrium at each radial surface of a GMC, including the outermost boundary.</description>

      <title>SQuIGG$\vec{L}$E: Observational Evidence of Low Ongoing Star Formation Rates in Gas-Rich Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA observations have shown that candidate "post-starburst" galaxies (PSBs) at z$\sim$0.6 can retain significant molecular gas reservoirs. These results would imply that -- unlike many model predictions -- galaxies can shut down their star formation before their cold gas reservoirs are depleted. However, these studies inferred star formation rates (SFRs) either from [O II] line fluxes or from spectral energy distribution modeling, and could have missed large dust-obscured contributions to the SFRs. In this study, we present Keck/NIRES observations of 13 massive ($\mathrm{M_*}\gtrsim \times 10^{11} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) PSBs, which allow us to estimate $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs in these gas-rich post-starburst galaxies. We confirm the previously inferred low SFRs for the majority of the sample: 11/13 targets show clear $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ absorption, with minimal infilling indicating dust-corrected SFRs of $&lt;4.1 \,\mathrm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$. These SFRs are notably low given the large $\mathrm{H_2}$ reservoirs ($\sim 1-5 \times 10^{10} \,\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) present in 5/13 of these galaxies, placing them significantly offset from star-forming galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star-forming galaxies. The [N II]/H$\alpha$ ratios of all 13 PSBs imply contributions from non-star-forming ionization mechanisms (e.g., AGN, shocks, or hot evolved stars) to their $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ emission, suggesting that even these low ongoing SFRs may be overestimated. These low $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ SFRs, dust-corrected using A$_v$ estimates from SED fitting, confirm that these galaxies are very likely quiescent and, thus, that galaxies can quench before their cold gas reservoirs are fully depleted.</description>

      <title>Differential virial analysis: a new technique to determine the dynamical state of molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since molecular clouds form stars, at least some parts of them must be in a state of collapse. However, there is a long-standing debate as to whether that collapse is local, involving only a small fraction of the cloud mass, or global, with most mass in a state of collapse up to the moment when it is dispersed by stellar feedback. In principle it is possible to distinguish these possibilities from clouds' virial ratios, which should be a factor of two larger for collapse than for equilibrium, but systematic uncertainties have thus far prevented such measurements. Here we propose a new analysis method to overcome this limitation: while the absolute value of a cloud's virial ratio is too uncertain to distinguish global from local collapse, the differential change in virial ratio as a function of surface density is also diagnostic of clouds' dynamical state, and can be measured with far fewer systematic uncertainties. We demonstrate the basic principles of the method using simple analytic models of supported and collapsing clouds, validate it from full 3D simulations, and discuss possible challenges in applying the method to real data. We then provide a preliminary application of the technique to recent observations of the molecular clouds in Andromeda, showing that most of them are inconsistent with being in a state of global collapse.</description>

      <title>Mapping H$\alpha$-Excess Candidate Point Sources in the Southern Hemisphere Using S-PLUS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We use the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Fourth Data Release (DR4) to identify and classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources in the Southern Sky, combining photometric data from 12 S-PLUS filters with machine learning to improve classification of H$\alpha$-related phenomena. Aims. Our goal is to classify H$\alpha$-excess point sources by distinguishing Galactic and extragalactic objects, particularly those with redshifted emission lines, and identifying variability phenomena like RR Lyrae stars. Methods. We selected H$\alpha$-excess candidates using the ($r - J0660$) vs. ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram from the S-PLUS main survey (MS) and Galactic Disk Survey (GDS). UMAP for dimensionality reduction and HDBSCAN clustering were used to separate source types. Infrared data was incorporated, and a Random Forest model was trained on clustering results to identify key colour features. New colour-colour diagrams from S-PLUS MS and infrared data offer a preliminary classification. Results. Combining multiwavelength data with machine learning significantly improved H$\alpha$-excess source classification. We identified 6956 sources with excess in the $J0660$ filter. Cross-matching with SIMBAD explored object types, including emission-line stars, young stellar objects, nebulae, stellar binaries, cataclysmic variables, QSOs, AGNs, and galaxies. Using S-PLUS colours and machine learning, we separated RR Lyrae stars from other sources. The separation of Galactic and extragalactic sources was clearer, but distinguishing cataclysmic variables from QSOs at certain redshifts remained challenging. Infrared data refined the classification, and the Random Forest model highlighted key colour features for future follow-up spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Star-Forming vs. Quenched Galaxies in Voids: Insights into the Role of Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the largest under-dense structures in the Universe, are crucial for exploring galaxy evolution. These vast, sparsely populated regions are home to void galaxies -- predominantly gas-rich, star-forming, and blue -- that evolve more slowly than those in denser environments. Additionally, the correlation between galaxy mergers and specific properties of galaxies, such as the star formation rate (SFR), is not fully understood, particularly in these under-dense environments. Quenched void galaxies exhibit high SFRs at high redshifts, significantly decreasing at lower redshifts (z &lt; 0.5). These galaxies have higher dark matter halos than star-forming galaxies across all redshifts, leading to rapid gas consumption. They formed earlier and experienced more major mergers in earlier epochs but fewer recent mergers, resulting in a lack of fresh gas for sustained star formation. Also, star-forming and high-mass quenched void galaxies show higher SFRs in mergers compared to non-merger galaxies. This study highlights that formation time, merger rates, and dark matter halos play a crucial role in the star formation history of void galaxies. Rapid and earlier gas consumption due to earlier formation time and the absence of recent mergers could lead to quenched void galaxies at lower redshifts, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution in low-density environments.</description>

      <title>A central TDE candidate detected through spectroscopic continuum emission properties in a SDSS blue quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.</description>

      <title>Central densities of dark matter halos in FIRE-2 simulations of low-mass galaxies with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the central density structure of dark matter halos in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models using simulations that are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. For simulated halos of dwarf galaxy scale ($M_{\rm halo}(z=0)\approx 10^{10}\,M_\odot$), we study the central structure in both dissipationless simulations and simulations with full FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics. As has been demonstrated extensively in recent years, both baryonic feedback and self-interactions can convert central cusps into cores, with the former process doing so in a manner that depends sensitively on stellar mass at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Whether the two processes (baryonic feedback and self-interactions) are distinguishable, however, remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that, compared to feedback-induced cores, SIDM-induced cores transition more quickly from the central region of constant density to the falling density at larger radial scales. This result holds true even when including identical galaxy formation modeling in SIDM simulations as is used in CDM simulations, since self-interactions dominate over galaxy formation physics in establishing the central structure of SIDM halos in this mass regime. The change in density profile slope as a function of radius therefore holds the potential to discriminate between self-interactions and galaxy formation physics as the driver of core formation in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of massive Star-forming regions -XX. Probability distribution function of integrated intensity for dense molecular gas tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N (J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the ATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions) Survey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function for these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the power-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the correlation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of the molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling relationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear, indicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the dense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship between Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally bound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star formation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak anti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star formation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the corresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps with substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>BASS XLV: Quantifying AGN Selection Effects in the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy Survey with BASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field (CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high column densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To quantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\sim0.05$) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\gtrsim$1000 cts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption distribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar luminosities to the CCLS ($L_\mathrm{2-10\ keV}^\mathrm{int}\sim10^{42-45}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration and low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the spectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to detect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\mathrm{H}&gt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and luminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient counts ($\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is significantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best fit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\mathrm{H}\geq10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually unobscured sources ($N_\mathrm{H}&lt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies that previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the obscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our findings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases and forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for higher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate obscuration in distant supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Milky Way's Dispersion Measure Using FRB and X-ray Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a valuable tool for probing the baryonic content of the intergalactic and the circumgalactic medium of the intervening galaxies along the sightlines. However, interpreting the DMs is complicated by the contributions from the hot gas in and around our Milky Way. This study examines the relationship between DM_MW, derived from localized FRBs, and the Galaxy's hot gas, using X-ray absorption and emission data from O VII and O VIII. We find evidence for a positive correlation between DM_MW and O VII absorption, reflecting contributions from both the disk and halo components. This conclusion is supported by two lines of evidence: (1) No correlation between DM_MW and O VII/O VIII emission, which primarily traces dense disk regions; and (2) the comparison with electron density models, where DM_MW aligns with models that incorporate both disk and halo components but significantly exceeds predictions from pure disk-only models, emphasizing the halo's role. Furthermore, the lack of correlation with O VIII absorption suggests that the primary temperature of the Galaxy's hot gas is likely around 2 x 10^6 K or less, as traced by O VII absorption, while gas at higher temperatures (~3 x 10^6 K to 5 x 10^6 K) is present but less abundant. Our findings provide insights into the Milky Way's gas distribution and improve DM_MW estimates for future cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Star formation from low to high mass: A comparative view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation has often been studied by separating the low- and high-mass regimes with an approximate boundary at 8M_sun. While some of the outcomes of the star-formation process are different between the two regimes, it is less clear whether the physical processes leading to these outcomes are that different at all. Here, we systematically compare low- and high-mass star formation by reviewing the most important processes and quantities from an observational and theoretical point of view. We identify three regimes where processes are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between low- and high-mass star formation.
  Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties and density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational characteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment.
  Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates as well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity significantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the magnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained.
  Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate mainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in regions forming high-mass stars. Nevertheless, accretion apparently can continue via disk structures in ionized accretion flows.
  Finally, we discuss to what extent a unified picture of star formation over all masses is possible and which issues need to be addressed in the future.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Mg II in SDSS J2320+0024: Implications for a Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Hole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present results from our spectroscopic follow-up of SDSS J2320+0024, a candidate binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a suspected sub-pc separation, identified by a 278-day periodicity observed in its multi-band optical light curves. We investigate the dramatic variability of the complex Mg II emission line profile aiming to test the alignments of the observed photometric light curves and the spectroscopic signatures in the context of the binary SMBH system. We extract the pure broad Mg II line from the newly obtained Gemini and Magellan spectra and measure the emission line parameters to reveal fundamental dynamical parameters of the SMBHs binary system. We adopt the PoSKI sub-pc binary SMBH model, which includes broad-line region (BLR) around less massive component and a circumbinary BLR, to interpret the observed variability in the spectral profile. We find that the Mg II line profile has a distinctive complex shape with the asymmetry and two peaks present which is varying across recent and archival observations. The temporal variability of the Mg II line profile may be associated with the emission from the binary SMBH system consisting of components with masses $M_1 = 2 \times 10^7 \, M_{\odot}$ and $M_2 = 2 \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, and eccentricity e = 0.1. With an total estimated mass of $\sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$ and a subannual orbital period, this system may be a rare example of high-mass compact candidate of SMBH binary, thus important for further investigations of the evolution of the binary system. This study is a prototype of synergies of spectroscopic follow-up and future massive time-domain photometric surveys like Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter presents Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the proposal that, below a certain acceleration scale $a_0$, dynamics departs from the Newtonian expectation. In that context, the determining factor for the emergence of apparent missing matter in galactic systems is predicted to be the acceleration, and not the mass or size of the system. MOND enables, for example, the prediction of rotation curves from only the baryonic distribution of galaxies. The simple rule is that the acceleration observed in the low-acceleration regime is the square root of the Newtonian expectation times $a_0$. Immediately, the flatness of rotation curves follows, as well as the proportionality of the fourth power of the asymptotic circular speed to only the baryonic mass of the galaxy. While the asymptotic circular speed is predicted not to depend on the baryonic surface density of galaxies of fixed baryonic mass, the inner shape of rotation curves is predicted to strongly depend on it. More generally, MOND implies an algebraic relation between the acceleration expected from Newtonian gravity and the total observed acceleration, at any radius in a galaxy. This is known, observationally, as the Radial Acceleration Relation. For galaxy clusters, it is commonly accepted that MOND fails, needing a stronger gravitational force (or more baryonic mass than observed) to account for the thermodynamic state of galaxy clusters, their lensing and kinematics. MOND, however, is not a complete theory, but a phenomenological non-relativistic paradigm in the limit of low accelerations, in need of embedding in a more fundamental theory. While various non-relativistic field theories of MOND exist, the search for a relativistic theory that recovers general relativity for high accelerations and MOND for low accelerations in the quasi-static limit, as well as a cosmology compatible with observations, is still on-going.</description>

      <title>EZOA: Nan\c{c}ay HI follow-up observations in the Zone of Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present follow-up 21cm HI line observations made with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) of 99 weak or potential detections of galaxies from the EZOA catalogue in the northern Zone of Avoidance (ZoA), which were extracted from the shallow version of the EBHIS blind HI survey performed with the Effelsberg radio telescope. The new NRT observations are on average almost three times as sensitive as those from EBHIS. Of the 99 observed sources, we confirmed 72, while three yielded inconclusive results. We find that the quality assessment of the EZOA catalogue entries correlates well with the NRT recovery rate; for instance, only four of the 22 potential detections could be confirmed. Due to the higher sensitivity as well as the large north-south extent of the NRT beam, the NRT observations also yielded five serendipitous detections, which we include here. We updated the EZOA catalogue with the improved HI parameters and detections. To test mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference signals, we also observed selected sources using a dedicated receiver and data processing system.</description>

      <title>The CLASS Quasar Catalog: Coronal Line Activity in Type 1 SDSS Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct the first systematic survey of a total of eleven optical coronal lines in the spectra of a large sample of low redshift (z &lt; 0.8) Type 1 quasars observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that strong coronal line emission is rare in SDSS even in Type 1 quasars; only 885 out of 19,508 (4.5%) galaxies show at least one coronal line, with higher ionization potential lines ($&gt;100$eV) being even rarer. The [Ne V] $\lambda$3426 line, which constitutes the majority of detections, is strongly correlated with the bolometric luminosity. These findings suggest that the optical coronal lines are significantly suppressed in the majority of local AGNs, possibly as a result of the presence of dust in the emitting regions. We find that the incidence of ionized outflows is significantly higher in coronal line emitters compared with non-coronal line emitters, possibly suggesting that dust destruction in outflows enhances coronal line emission in AGNs. Many coronal lines show line profiles that are broader than those of narrow lines, and are blue-shifted relative the lower ionization potential lines, suggesting outflows in the highly ionized gas. Given the limited number of detections, we do not find any statistically significant trends of detection statistics, or line ratios with black hole mass, Eddington ratio, or AGN bolometric luminosity. The catalog is publicly available and can provide a useful database of the coronal line properties of low redshift quasars that can be compared to the growing number of high-z AGNs discovered by JWST.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of bars in quenching star formation using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are ubiquitously found in disc galaxies and are known to drive galaxy evolution through secular processes. However, the specific contribution of bars in suppression of star formation (SF) is still under inspection which we investigate in this paper using spatially resolved UV-optical colour maps &amp; radial color profiles of a sample of 17 centrally quenched (CQ) barred galaxies in redshift range 0.02-0.06. The sample is selected based on their location in M$_{\ast}$ - SFR plane. They are classified as passive based on parameters from MPA-JHU VAC, but non-passive based on the GSWLC catalog, indicating a passive inner region &amp; recent star formation in their extended disc. We use archival SDSS r-band and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV imaging data and created spatially resolved (FUV-NUV vs NUV-r) colour maps to understand the nature of UV emission from different regions of these galaxies. We then analyse their NUV-r radial profiles using NUV-r colour as a proxy for stellar population (SP) age. A control sample of 8 CQ unbarred galaxies is also analysed to disentangle the effect of bulge and bar in quenching SF. The CQ barred galaxies display redder colors (NUV-r $&gt;$ 4-4.5 mag) in inner regions, up to the length of the bar, indicating the age of stellar population in these regions to be older than $&gt;$ 1 Gyr. Most barred galaxies in our sample host pseudo bulges and do not host AGN, emphasizing most probable reason for the internal quenching is action of stellar bar. In comparison to the unbarred, the barred galaxies show redder colors to a larger spatial extent. We conclude that bars in their later stages of evolution turn the inner regions of galaxies redder, leading to quenching, with the effect being most prominent up to the ends of the bar and creating a region dominated by older SP. This may occur when bars have already funneled gas to the galactic centre leaving behind no fuel for further SF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a review of our current knowledge of galaxies throughout the first billion years of cosmic history. This field has undergone a transformation in the last two years following the launch of $\textit{JWST}$, and we aim to deliver an observational overview of what we have learned about $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We introduce the latest selection methods of high redshift galaxies and describe new measurements of the census of continuum-selected and dusty star forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim 5$. We discuss new measurements of the UV luminosity function at $z\gtrsim 10$ and associated implications for early star formation. We then summarize what is being learned about the physical properties of early galaxies, with up-to-date discussions of the sizes, masses, ages, metallicities, abundance patterns, UV colors, dust properties, and ionizing sources in $z\gtrsim 5$ galaxies. We review observational evidence for bursty star formation histories and describe prospects for characterizing the duty cycle with future observations. We provide a brief overview of the insight being gained through new detections of AGN in early galaxies. Finally we introduce the latest constraints on the contribution of galaxies to reionziation and discuss how $\textit{JWST}$ measurements of Ly$\alpha$ emission offer the potential to probe the earliest stages of the process. This review is meant to provide a broad introduction to those new to the observational study of very high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Feedback and dynamical masses in high-$z$ galaxies: the advent of high-resolution NIRSpec spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback is an essential step in the baryon cycle of galaxies, but it remains unconstrained beyond Cosmic Noon. We study the ionized gas kinematics, dynamical mass and gas-flow properties of a sample of 16 sub-$L^{\star}$ star-forming galaxies at $4\leq z\leq7.6$, using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec observations. The emission lines are resolved, with velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm gas}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}\simeq38-96$) comparable to more massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon. From $\sigma_{\rm gas}$ and the galaxy size ($r_e=400-960~$pc), we estimate the dynamical mass to be $\log M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot}=9.25-10.25$. Stellar-to-dynamical mass ratios are low ($\log M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}\in[-0.5,-2]$) and decrease with increasing SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). We estimate the gas surface densities assuming a star-formation law, but the gas masses do not balance the baryon-to-dynamical mass ratios, which would require a decrease in the star-formation efficiency. We find evidence of ionized outflows in five out of the sixteen galaxies, based on the need of broad components to reproduce the emission-line wings. We only observe outflows from galaxies undergoing recent bursts of star formation ${\rm SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}\geq1}$, with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and low $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. This links high gas surface densities to increased outflow incidence and lower $M_{\star}/M_{\rm dyn}$. With moderate outflow velocities ($v_{\rm flow}{\rm~(km~s^{-1})}=150-250$) and mass outflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}=0.2-5$), these high-redshift galaxies appear more efficient at removing baryons than low-redshift galaxies with similar $M_{\star}$, showing mass loading-factors of $\dot{M}_{\rm flow}/{\rm SFR}=0.04-0.4$. For their given dynamical mass, the outflow velocities exceed the escape velocities, meaning that they may eventually enrich the Circumgalactic Medium.</description>

      <title>Gaia-ESO Survey: massive stars in the Carina Nebula. II. The spectroscopic analysis of the O-star population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new census of massive stars in the Carina nebula reveals the presence of 54 apparently single O-type stars in the Car OB1 association, an extremely active star-forming region which hosts some of the most luminous stars of the Milky Way. A detailed spectroscopic analysis of the currently most complete sample of O-type stars in the association can be used to inspect the main physical properties of cluster members and test evolutionary and stellar atmospheres models. We perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis for the most complete sample of apparently single O-type stars in Car OB1 with available spectroscopic data. From the high-resolution GES and OWN spectra we obtain a reliable distribution of rotational velocities for a sample of 37 O-type stars. It shows a bimodal structure with a low velocity peak at 60 km s$^{-1}$ and a short tail of fast rotators reaching 320 km s$^{-1}$. We also perform quantitative spectroscopic analysis and derive effective temperature, surface gravity and He abundance for a sample of 47 O-type stars, now including further stars from GOSSS database. Radii, luminosities, and spectroscopic masses were also determined using $Gaia$ astrometry. We create the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to inspect the evolutionary status of the region and confirm the lack of stars close to the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) between $\sim$35 -- 55 M$_\odot$. We confirm a very young population with an age distribution peaking at 1 Myr, some stars close or even on the ZAMS, and a secondary peak at 4 -- 5 Myr in the age distribution. We confirm the youth of Trumpler 14, which is also the only cluster not showing the secondary peak. We also find a clear trend to evolutionary masses higher than derived spectroscopic masses for stars with evolutionary mass below 40 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Model for the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the CAMELS Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution, $p(\mathrm{DM})$ of cosmic dispersion measures (DM) measured in fast radio bursts (FRBs) encodes information about both cosmology and galaxy feedback. In this work, we study the effect of feedback parameters in the $p(\mathrm{DM})$ calculated from the full Latin Hypercube of parameters sampled by the CAMELS hydrodynamical simulation suite, building a neural network (NN) model that performs well in emulating the effect of feedback on $p(\mathrm{DM})$ at arbitrary redshifts at $z\leq1$. Using this NN model, we further study the parameter $F\equiv \sigma_{\rm DM} \, z^{1/2}$, which is commonly used to summarize the scatter on $p(\mathrm{DM})$. We find that $F$ does not depend monotonically on every feedback parameter; instead each feedback mechanism jointly influences the final feedback strength in non-trivial ways. Even the largest values of $F$ that we find in our entire parameter space are small compared to the current constraints from observed FRB DMs by Baptista et al. 2024, pointing at the limitations of the CAMELS suite due to the small simulation box sizes. In the future, with larger box-sizes from CAMELS-like suites, similar models can be used to constrain the parameters governing galaxy feedback in the increasing observational samples of FRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DDO68-V1 is a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) star in the eXtremely Metal-Poor (XMP) galaxy DDO68. It resides in the HII region with 12+log(O/H)~7.1 dex, or Z ~ Zo/40. Since DDO68-V1 is the only known LBV with a so low initial metallicity, its in-deep study can give the hints for understanding the LBV evolutionary stage and the nature of their powerful and highly variable mass loss in the very low-metallicity regime. Our goal is to study the optical variability of DDO68-V1 during the last 36 years, with the emphasis on the period of the last 8 years, after the LBV giant eruption. We use our published results of monitoring in B, V, R bands of the total flux of HII region 'Knot 3', containing the LBV, along with photometry of the archive Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, obtained in May 2010 and December 2017. This data allow us to disentangle the variable light of DDO68-V1 and that of the underlying HII region. From all available photometry of Knot 3, we derive the V-band lightcurve of DDO68-V1 since 1988, with a higher cadence during the years 2015-2023, when the lightcurve resembles that of S Doradus. The new data reveal the full range of DDO68-V1 absolute magnitudes M_V of [-5.9, --10.8] mag. The LBV variations after the fading of the 'giant eruption' show the unusually large amplitude of delta_V &gt; 3.0-3.5mag on the time-scale of ~1-1.5 year. The apparent changes of the integrated B-V colour of Knot 3 are consistent with the expected colour variations of the LBV in course of the S Doradus 'normal eruptions'. These data, along with spectra of DDO68-V1, demonstrate the need for a higher-cadence photometry of DDO68-V1, in order to probe the possible periodicity in its lightcurve and binarity of the object.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent far-infrared polarization of HL Tau observed with SOFIA/HAWC+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first polarimetric observations of a circumstellar disk in the far-infrared wavelength range. We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>

      <title>A failed wind candidate in NGC 3783 from the 2001 year campaign with Chandra/HETGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the Chandra/HETGS observations of NGC 3783 from the campaign in the year 2001, identifying significant spectral variations in the Fe unresolved transition array (UTA) over timescales of weeks to months. These changes correlate with a $1.4-2$ fold increase in the ionizing continuum and exceed $10 \, \sigma$ significance. The variations primarily originate from a low-ionization state ($\rm log \xi = 1.65$) component of the warm absorber. Time-dependent photoionization modelling confirms the sensitivity of this low-ionization component to continuum variations within the Fe UTA band. Local fitting indicates a lower density limit of $&gt;10^{12.3} \, \rm m^{-3}$ at $3 \, \sigma$ statistical uncertainty, with the component located within $0.27 \, \rm pc$. Our findings suggest that this low-ionization component is a potential failed wind candidate.</description>

      <title>The case for large-scale AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations: insights from XFABLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While cosmological simulations of galaxy formation have reached maturity, able to reproduce many fundamental galaxy and halo properties, no consensus has yet been reached on the impact of `baryonic feedback' on the non-linear matter power spectrum. This severely limits the precision of (and potentially biases) small-scale cosmological constraints obtained from weak lensing and galaxy surveys. Recent observational evidence indicates that `baryonic feedback' may be more extreme than commonly assumed in current cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we therefore explore a range of empirical AGN feedback models, within the FABLE simulation suite, with different parameterizations as a function of cosmic time, host halo properties, and/or spatial location where feedback energy is thermalized. We demonstrate that an AGN radio-mode feedback acting in a larger population of black holes, with jets thermalizing at relatively large cluster-centric distances, as exemplified by our XFABLE model, is in good agreement with the latest weak lensing + kSZ constraints across all k-scales. Furthermore, XFABLE maintains good agreement with the galaxy stellar mass function, gas fraction measurements, and all key galaxy group and cluster properties, including scaling relations and ICM radial profiles. Our work highlights the pressing need to model black hole accretion and feedback physics with a greater level of realism, including relativistic, magnetized jets in full cosmological simulations. Finally, we discuss how a range of complementary observational probes in the near future will enable us to constrain AGN feedback models, and therefore reduce `baryonic feedback' modelling uncertainty for the upcoming era of large cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Optical investigation of supernova remnant G206.7+5.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) G206.7+5.9 was recently discovered in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The remnant spans about 3.5 in diameter and exhibits bilateral shells. In this work, we present optical spectra of G206.7+5.9 with the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), and narrow-band (H$\alpha$ and [SII]) images with the 1-m T100 telescope. The filamentary structure seen in H$\alpha$ image shows a clear correlation with the radio emission. We use optical line ratios to determine the physical parameters of G206.7+5.9. The LAMOST spectra reveal large ratios of [SII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.61-1.78) and [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim$ (0.63-1.92) consistent with that expected for a shock-heated SNR. The emission lines [OI] $\lambda$6300, $\lambda$6363 detected in the spectra also support the presence of shocks. Electron density ($n_{\rm e}$) measurements based on the [SII] $\lambda$6716/$\lambda$6731 ratio suggest densities between 117 and 597 cm$^{-3}$. We estimate the pre-shock cloud density ($n_{\rm c}$) to be approximately 2.6$-$13.3 cm$^{-3}$. We also investigate the archival HI data and have newly identified an expanding gas motion of the HI, whose velocity span is approximately 10 km s$^{-1}$. We conclude that G206.7+5.9 is an SNR exhibiting properties remarkably similar to those seen in Galactic SNRs.</description>

      <title>The interplay between super-metallicity, lithium depletion, and radial migration in nearby stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a peculiar set of old super-metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between $\sim$ 0.5-1.5 kpc observed by the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. These stars show lithium (Li) depletion, which is anti-correlated with their [Fe/H]. To investigate these stars' chemo-dynamical properties, we used data from the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. We applied hierarchical clustering to group the stars based on their abundances (excluding Li). Orbits were integrated using \emph{Gaia} astrometry and radial velocities from \emph{Gaia}-ESO. Our analysis suggests that the high metallicity of these stars is incompatible with their formation in the solar neighbourhood. We also found that their Li envelope abundance is below the benchmark meteoritic value, in agreement with previous works. This result supports the idea that the Li abundance in old, super-metal-rich dwarf stars should not be considered a proxy for the local interstellar medium Li.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of twelve metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates in the dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)~968 kpc away, at a present-day metallicity of [Fe/H] around $-$0.9. These candidates have masses between 1.25-5 M$_{\odot}$, with ages &lt;10 Myr, and exhibit significant near-infrared excesses at 2.5 and 4.3 $\mu$m. They are concentrated within a cluster roughly 10 pc (2'') across situated in the HII region [HM95]-9. These are the most distant and metal-poor PMS stars known, and can offer new quantitative insights into star formation at low-metallicities.</description>

      <title>Non-halo structures and their effects on gravitationally lensed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the $\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on smaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark matter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence gravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the dark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form and thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter (WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\chi}$ = 3 keV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally excluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal velocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for first-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed systems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these simulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a smooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations from WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of the main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these variations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical power-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic lensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a strong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing analyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that while non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact remains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and CDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Formation and Symbiotic Evolution with the Inter-Galactic Medium in the Age of ELT-ANDES</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution absorption spectroscopy toward bright background sources has had a paramount role in understanding early galaxy formation, the evolution of the intergalactic medium and the reionisation of the Universe. However, these studies are now approaching the boundaries of what can be achieved at ground-based 8-10m class telescopes. The identification of primeval systems at the highest redshifts, within the reionisation epoch and even into the dark ages, and of the products of the first generation of stars and the chemical enrichment of the early Universe, requires observing very faint targets with a signal-to-noise ratio high enough to detect very faint spectral signatures. In this paper, we describe the giant leap forward that will be enabled by ANDES, the high-resolution spectrograph for the ELT, in these key science fields, together with a brief, non-exhaustive overview of other extragalactic research topics that will be pursued by this instrument, and its synergistic use with other facilities that will become available in the early 2030s.</description>

      <title>Properties of 3D HI Filaments in the Smith High Velocity Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present findings of 3D filamentary structures in the Smith Cloud, a high-velocity cloud (HVC) located at $l=38^{\circ}$, $b=-13^{\circ}$. We use data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array \ion{H}{i} (GALFA-\ion{H}{i}) along with our new filament detection algorithm, \texttt{fil3d}, to characterize these structures. In this paper, we also discuss how different input parameters affect the output of \texttt{fil3d}. We study filaments in the local ISM and compare them to those found in the Smith Cloud. Based on thermal linewidth estimations we find supporting evidence that the Smith Cloud filaments are part of its warm neutral medium. We also find a relationship between thermal linewidth and the $v_{LSR}$ of the filaments. We study the plane-of-sky magnetic field as traced by Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission along the line of sight and find the HI filaments in this region are not aligned with the magnetic field. This is likely related to their location close to dynamic processes in the Galactic Plane and/or the low column density of the filaments relative to emission in the Plane. The results show the HI filaments are found in a wide range of Galactic environments and form through multiple processes.</description>

      <title>COOL-LAMPS. VII. Quantifying Strong-lens Scaling Relations with 177 Cluster-scale Strong Gravitational Lenses in DECaLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the Einstein-radius-enclosed total mass for 177 cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses identified by the ChicagO Optically selected Lenses Located At the Margins of Public Surveys (COOL-LAMPS) collaboration with lens redshifts ranging from $0.2 \lessapprox z \lessapprox 1.0$ using the brightest-cluster-galaxy (BCG) redshift and an observable proxy for the Einstein radius. We constrain the Einstein-radius-enclosed luminosity and stellar mass by fitting parametric spectral energy distributions to aperture photometry from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey in the $g$-, $r$-, and $z$-band Dark Energy Camera filters. We find that the BCG redshift, enclosed total mass, and enclosed luminosity are strongly correlated and well described by a planar relationship in 3D space. We find that the enclosed total mass and stellar mass are correlated with a logarithmic slope of $0.500^{+0.029}_{-0.031}$, and the enclosed total mass and stellar-to-total mass fraction are correlated with a logarithmic slope of $-0.495^{+0.032}_{-0.033}$. In tandem with the small radii within which these slopes are constrained, this may suggest invariance in baryon conversion efficiency and feedback strength as a function of cluster-centric radii in galaxy clusters. Additionally, the correlations described here should have utility in ranking strong-lensing candidates in upcoming imaging surveys -- such as Rubin/Legacy Survey of Space and Time -- in which an algorithmic treatment of strong lenses will be needed due to the sheer volume of data these surveys will produce.</description>

      <title>A Heavy Seed Black Hole Mass Function at High Redshift -- Prospects for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of new and near-future observatories probing the earliest epochs of the Universe has opened the opportunity to investigate the formation and growth of the first massive black holes (MBHs). Additionally, the use of high resolution cosmological simulations to investigate these high-redshift environments is needed to predict the dark matter halos in which these MBH seeds will form. We use the Renaissance simulations to analyse the formation and growth of so-called heavy seed black holes. Other past work has investigated the formation and growth of light (black hole) seeds with Renaissance and found that these black holes do not grow in the environments in which they reside. In this work we seed MBHs, in post-processing, and track accretion onto the MBHs as well as mergers with other MBHs at high-redshift. We show that the heavy seeds struggle to achieve high accretion rates with only the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$) growing at close to the Eddington limit under optimistic conditions. Despite the lack of significant growth for these early MBHs, the signals from their merger events will be sufficiently strong (SNR $\sim 10^2$) to be probed by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories, such as LISA. We predict that LISA will observe of the order of 10 MBH merger events per year where the mergers occur at z $\gtrsim$ 10 or at least begin their early inspiral phase at z $\gtrsim$ 10.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive 3-D model of the central 300 pc of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is of fundamental importance in understanding energy cycles in galactic nuclei, since the 3-D structure influences the location and intensity of star formation, feedback, and black hole accretion. Current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish between existing 3-D models. Dust extinction is one diagnostic tool that can help determine the location of dark molecular clouds relative to the bright Galactic Center emission. By combining Herschel and Spitzer observations, we developed three new dust extinction techniques to estimate the likely near/far locations for each cloud in the CMZ. We compare our results to four geometric CMZ orbital models. Our extinction methods show good agreement with each other, and with results from spectral line absorption analysis from Walker et al. (submitted). Our near/far results for CMZ clouds are inconsistent with a projected version of the Sofue (1995) two spiral arms model, and show disagreement in position-velocity space with the Molinari et al. (2011) closed elliptical orbit. Our results are in reasonable agreement with the Kruijssen et al. (2015) open streams. We find that a simplified toy-model elliptical orbit which conserves angular momentum shows promising fits in both position-position and position-velocity space. We conclude that all current CMZ orbital models lack the complexity needed to describe the motion of gas in the CMZ, and further work is needed to construct a complex orbital model to accurately describe gas flows in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Estimating Masses of Supermassive Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei from the Halpha Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this project is to construct an estimator for the masses of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the broad Halpha emission line. We make use of published reverberation mapping data. We remeasure all Halpha time lags from the original data as we find that often the reverberation measurements are improved by detrending the light curves. We produce mass estimators that require only the Halpha luminosity and the width of the Halpha emission line as characterized by either the FWHM or the line dispersion. It is possible, on the basis of a single spectrum covering the Halpha emission line, to estimate the mass of the central supermassive black hole in AGNs, taking into account all three parameters believed to affect mass measurement: luminosity, line width, and Eddington ratio. The typical formal accuracy in such estimates is of order 0.2-0.3 dex.</description>

      <title>BPASS stellar evolution models incorporating $\alpha$-enhanced composition -- I. Single star models from 0.1 to 316 M$_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23167</link>

Abstract: Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Dust Emission within the Orion Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda &gt; 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $&gt; 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>SIRIUS: Identifying Metal-poor Stars Enriched by a Single Supernova in a Dwarf Galaxy Cosmological Zoom-in Simulation Resolving Individual Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-poor stars enriched by a single supernova (mono-enriched stars) are direct proof (and provide valuable probes) of supernova nucleosynthesis. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have shown that metal-poor stars have a wide variety of chemical compositions; the star's chemical composition reflects the nucleosynthesis process(es) that occurred before the star's formation. While the identification of mono-enriched stars enables us to study the ejecta properties of a single supernova, the fraction of mono-enriched stars among metal-poor stars remains unknown. Here we identify mono-enriched stars in a dwarf galaxy cosmological zoom-in simulation resolving individual massive stars. We find that the fraction of mono-enriched stars is higher for lower metallicity, stars with [Fe/H] $&lt; -2.5$. The percentages of mono-enriched stars are 11% at [Fe/H] = $-$5.0 and 1% at [Fe/H] = $-$2.5, suggesting that most metal-poor stars are affected by multiple supernovae. We also find that mono-enriched stars tend to be located near the center of the simulated dwarf. Such regions will be explored in detail in upcoming surveys such as the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) on the Subaru telescope.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work. Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.</description>

      <title>Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>
