      <title>On the Two-parameter Matrix pencil Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiparameter matrix pencil problem (MPP) is a generalization of the one-parameter MPP: given a set of $m\times n$ complex matrices $A_0,\ldots, A_r$, with $m\ge n+r-1$, it is required to find all complex scalars $\lambda_0,\ldots,\lambda_r$, not all zero, such that the matrix pencil $A(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^r\lambda_iA_i$ loses column rank and the corresponding nonzero complex vector $x$ such that $A(\lambda)x=0$. This problem is related to the well-known multiparameter eigenvalue problem except that there is only one pencil and, crucially, the matrices are not necessarily square. In this paper, we give a full solution to the two-parameter MPP. Firstly, an inflation process is implemented to show that the two-parameter MPP is equivalent to a set of three $m^2\times n^2$ simultaneous one-parameter MPPs. These problems are given in terms of Kronecker commutator operators (involving the original matrices) which exhibit several symmetries. These symmetries are analysed and are then used to deflate the dimensions of the one-parameter MPPs to $\frac{m(m-1)}{2}\times\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ thus simplifying their numerical solution. In the case that $m=n+1$ it is shown that the two-parameter MPP has at least one solution and generically $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ solutions and furthermore that, under a rank assumption, the Kronecker determinant operators satisfy a commutativity property. This is then used to show that the two-parameter MPP is equivalent to a set of three simultaneous eigenvalue problems. A general solution algorithm is presented and numerical examples are given to outline the procedure of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Local Discontinuous Galerkin method for nonlinear cross-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a structure-preserving method for the approximation of solutions to nonlinear cross-diffusion systems, which combines a Local Discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization with the backward Euler time stepping scheme. The proposed method makes use of the underlying entropy structure of the system, expressing the main unknown in terms of the entropy variable by means of a nonlinear transformation. Such a transformation allows for imposing the physical positivity or boundedness constraints on the approximate solution in a strong sense. Moreover, nonlinearities do not appear explicitly within differential operators or interface terms in the scheme, which significantly improves its efficiency and ease its implementation. We prove the existence of discrete solutions and their asymptotic convergence to continuous weak solutions. Numerical results for some one- and two-dimensional problems illustrate the accuracy and entropy stability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Split Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm for Block Toeplitz Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numeric modeling of electromagnetics and acoustics frequently entails matrix-vector multiplication with block Toeplitz structure. When the corresponding block Toeplitz matrix is not highly sparse, e.g. when considering the electromagnetic Green function in a spatial basis, such calculations are often carried out by performing a multilevel embedding that gives the matrix a fully circulant form. While this transformation allows the associated matrix-vector multiplication to be computed via Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and diagonal multiplication, generally leading to dramatic performance improvements compared to naive multiplication, it also adds unnecessary information that increases memory consumption and reduces computational efficiency. As an improvement, we propose a lazy embedding, eager projection, algorithm that for dimensionality $d$, asymptotically reduces the number of needed computations $\propto d/ \left(2 - 2^{-d+1}\right)$ and peak memory usage $\propto 2/\left((d+1)2^{-d} + 1\right)$, generally, and $\propto\left(2^{d} + 1\right)/\left(d +2\right)$ for a fully symmetric or skew-symmetric systems. The structure of the algorithm suggests several simple approaches for parallelization of large block Toeplitz matrix-vector products across multiple devices and adds flexibility in memory and task management.</description>

      <title>A hybrid numerical method for elastic wave propagation in discontinuous media with complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a high order accurate numerical method for solving the elastic wave equation in second-order form. We hybridize the computationally efficient Cartesian grid formulation of finite differences with geometrically flexible discontinuous Galerkin methods on unstructured grids by a penalty based technique. At the interface between the two methods, we construct projection operators for the pointwise finite difference solutions and discontinuous Galerkin solutions based on piecewise polynomials. In addition, we optimize the projection operators for both accuracy and spectrum. We prove that the overall discretization conserves a discrete energy, and verify optimal convergence in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stability and Robustness of Time-discretization Schemes for the Allen-Cahn Equation via Bifurcation and Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Allen-Cahn equation is a fundamental model for phase transitions, offering critical insights into the dynamics of interface evolution in various physical systems. This paper investigates the stability and robustness of frequently utilized time-discretization numerical schemes for solving the Allen-Cahn equation, with focuses on the Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson (CN), convex splitting of modified CN, and Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods. Our stability analysis reveals that the Convex Splitting of the Modified CN scheme exhibits unconditional stability, allowing greater flexibility in time step selection, while the other schemes are conditionally stable. Additionally, our robustness analysis highlights that the Backward Euler method converges to correct physical solutions regardless of initial conditions. In contrast, the other methods studied in this work show sensitivity to initial conditions and may converge to incorrect physical solutions if the initial conditions are not carefully chosen. This study introduces a comprehensive approach to assessing stability and robustness in numerical methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation, providing a new perspective for evaluating numerical techniques for general nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>A note on the stability of two families of two-step schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of two families of three-level two-step schemes that extend the classical second order BDF (BDF2) and second order Adams-Moulton (AM2) schemes. For a free parameter restricted to an appropriate range that covers the classical case, we show that both the generalized BDF2 and the generalized AM2 schemes are A-stable. We also introduce the concept of uniform-in-time stability which characterizes a scheme's ability to inherit the uniform boundedness over all time of the solution of damped and forced equation with the force uniformly bounded in time. We then demonstrate that A-stability and uniform-in-time stability are equivalent for three-level two-step schemes. Next, these two families of schemes are utilized to construct efficient and unconditionally stable IMEX schemes for systems that involve a damping term, a skew symmetric term, and a forcing term. These novel IMEX schemes are shown to be uniform-in-time energy stable in the sense that the norm of any numerical solution is bounded uniformly over all time, provided that the forcing term is uniformly bounded time, the skew symmetric term is dominated by the dissipative term, together with a mild time-step restriction. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results. They also indicate that the generalized schemes could be more accurate and/or more stable than the classical ones for suitable choice of the parameter.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio ($\mathcal{O}(10^5)$) two-phase flows is important for many applications in material science and manufacturing. In this work, we consider numerical simulations of molten metal undergoing microgravity oscillations. Accurate simulation of the oscillation dynamics allows us to characterize the interplay between the two fluids' surface tension and density ratio, which is an important consideration for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows under these large density ratios. A modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. [$\textit{A fully-coupled framework for solving Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations: Second-order, energy-stable numerical methods on adaptive octree based meshes.}$, Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874] is used. We present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We deploy our framework to predict the oscillation behavior of three physical systems exhibiting very large density ratios ($10^4-10^5:1$) that have previously never been performed.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Emulation of Finite-Element Ice Dynamics in Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although numerical models provide accurate solutions for ice sheet dynamics based on physics laws, they accompany intensified computational demands to solve partial differential equations. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as statistical emulators for those numerical models. However, since CNNs operate on regular grids, they cannot represent the refined meshes and computational efficiency of finite-element numerical models. Therefore, instead of CNNs, this study adopts an equivariant graph convolutional network (EGCN) as an emulator for the ice sheet dynamics modeling. EGCN reproduces ice thickness and velocity changes in the Helheim Glacier, Greenland, and Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, with 260 times and 44 times faster computation time, respectively. Compared to the traditional CNN and graph convolutional network, EGCN shows outstanding accuracy in thickness prediction near fast ice streams by preserving the equivariance to the translation and rotation of graphs.</description>

      <title>Function recovery on manifolds using scattered data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of recovering a Sobolev function on a connected compact Riemannian manifold $M$ when given a sample on a finite point set. We prove that the quality of the sample is given by the $L_\gamma(M)$-average of the geodesic distance to the point set and determine the value of $\gamma\in (0,\infty]$. This extends our findings on bounded convex domains [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44:1346--1371, 2024]. As a byproduct, we prove the optimal rate of convergence of the $n$-th minimal worst case error for $L_q(M)$-approximation for all $1\le q \le \infty$.
  Further, a limit theorem for moments of the average distance to a set consisting of i.i.d.\ uniform points is proven. This yields that a random sample is asymptotically as good as an optimal sample in precisely those cases with $\gamma&lt;\infty$. In particular, we obtain that cubature formulas with random nodes are asymptotically as good as optimal cubature formulas if the weights are chosen correctly. This closes a logarithmic gap left open by Ehler, Gr\"af and Oates [Stat. Comput., 29:1203-1214, 2019].</description>

      <title>Randomized sketching of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational approximation is a powerful tool to obtain accurate surrogates for nonlinear functions that are easy to evaluate and linearize. The interpolatory adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) method is one approach to construct such approximants numerically. For large-scale vector- and matrix-valued functions, however, the direct application of the set-valued variant of AAA becomes inefficient. We propose and analyze a new sketching approach for such functions called sketchAAA that, with high probability, leads to much better approximants than previously suggested approaches while retaining efficiency. The sketching approach works in a black-box fashion where only evaluations of the nonlinear function at sampling points are needed. Numerical tests with nonlinear eigenvalue problems illustrate the efficacy of our approach, with speedups above 200 for sampling large-scale black-box functions without sacrificing on accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider wave propagation problems over 2-dimensional domains with piecewise-linear boundaries, possibly including scatterers. We assume that the wave speed is constant, and that the initial conditions and forcing terms are radially symmetric and compactly supported. We propose an approximation of the propagating wave as the sum of some special space-time functions. Each term in this sum identifies a particular field component, modeling the result of a single reflection or diffraction effect. We describe an algorithm for identifying such components automatically, based on the domain geometry. To showcase our proposed method, we present several numerical examples, such as waves scattering off wedges and waves propagating through a room in presence of obstacles. Software implementing our numerical algorithm is made available as open-source code.</description>

Abstract: Boundary value problems based on the convection-diffusion equation arise naturally in models of fluid flow across a variety of engineering applications and design feasibility studies. Naturally, their efficient numerical solution has continued to be an interesting and active topic of research for decades. In the context of finite-element discretization of these boundary value problems, the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) technique yields accurate discretization in the singularly perturbed regime. In this paper, we propose efficient multigrid iterative solution methods for the resulting linear systems. In particular, we show that techniques from standard multigrid for anisotropic problems can be adapted to these discretizations on both tensor-product as well as semi-structured meshes. The resulting methods are demonstrated to be robust preconditioners for several standard flow benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Local spline refinement driven by fault jump estimates for scattered data approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new fault jump estimates to guide local refinement in surface approximation schemes with adaptive spline constructions. The proposed approach is based on the idea that, since discontinuities in the data should naturally correspond to sharp variations in the reconstructed surface, the location and size of jumps detected in the input point cloud should drive the mesh refinement algorithm. To exploit the possibility of inserting local meshlines in one or the other coordinate direction, as suggested by the jump estimates, we propose a quasi-interpolation (QI) scheme based on locally refined B-splines (LR B-splines). Particular attention is devoted to the construction of the local operator of the LR B-spline QI scheme, which properly adapts the spline approximation according to the nature and density of the scattered data configuration. A selection of numerical examples outlines the performance of the method on synthetic and real datasets characterized by different geographical features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an implicit staggered algorithm for crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) which makes use of dynamic relaxation at the constitutive integration level. An uncoupled version of the constitutive system consists of a multi-surface flow law complemented by an evolution law for the hardening variables. Since a saturation law is adopted for hardening, a sequence of nonlinear iteration followed by a linear system is feasible. To tie the constitutive unknowns, the dynamic relaxation method is adopted. A Green-Naghdi plasticity model is adopted based on the Hencky strain calculated using a $[2/2]$ Pad\'e approximation. For the incompressible case, the approximation error is calculated exactly. A enhanced-assumed strain (EAS) element technology is adopted, which was found to be especially suited to localization problems such as the ones resulting from crystal plasticity plane slipping. Analysis of the results shows significant reduction of drift and well defined localization without spurious modes or hourglassing.</description>

      <title>Sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling recovery on some function classes is studied in this paper. Typically, function classes are defined by imposing smoothness conditions. It was understood in nonlinear approximation that structural conditions in the form of control of the number of big coefficients of an expansion of a function with respect to a given system of functions plays an important role. Sampling recovery on smoothness classes is an area of active research, some problems, especially in the case of mixed smoothness classes, are still open. It was discovered recently that universal sampling discretization and nonlinear sparse approximations are useful in the sampling recovery problem. This motivated us to systematically study sampling recovery on function classes with a structural condition. Some results in this direction are already known. In particular, the classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic cubes are studied in the recent author's papers. In this paper we concentrate on studying function classes defined by conditions on coefficients with indices from the domains, which are differences of two dyadic hyperbolic crosses.</description>

      <title>Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold using second-order information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riemannian optimization is concerned with problems, where the independent variable lies on a smooth manifold. There is a number of problems from numerical linear algebra that fall into this category, where the manifold is usually specified by special matrix structures, such as orthogonality or definiteness. Following this line of research, we investigate tools for Riemannian optimization on the symplectic Stiefel manifold. We complement the existing set of numerical optimization algorithms with a Riemannian trust region method tailored to the symplectic Stiefel manifold. To this end, we derive a matrix formula for the Riemannian Hessian under a right-invariant metric. Moreover, we propose a novel retraction for approximating the Riemannian geodesics. Finally, we conduct a comparative study in which we juxtapose the performance of the Riemannian variants of the steepest descent, conjugate gradients, and trust region methods on selected matrix optimization problems that feature symplectic constraints.</description>

      <title>Gradient Coding with Iterative Block Leverage Score Sampling</title>

Abstract: We generalize the leverage score sampling sketch for $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, to accommodate sampling subsets of the transformed data, so that the sketching approach is appropriate for distributed settings. This is then used to derive an approximate coded computing approach for first-order methods; known as gradient coding, to accelerate linear regression in the presence of failures in distributed computational networks, \textit{i.e.} stragglers. We replicate the data across the distributed network, to attain the approximation guarantees through the induced sampling distribution. The significance and main contribution of this work, is that it unifies randomized numerical linear algebra with approximate coded computing, while attaining an induced $\ell_2$-subspace embedding through uniform sampling. The transition to uniform sampling is done without applying a random projection, as in the case of the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform. Furthermore, by incorporating this technique to coded computing, our scheme is an iterative sketching approach to approximately solving linear regression. We also propose weighting when sketching takes place through sampling with replacement, for further compression.</description>

      <title>MgNO: Efficient Parameterization of Linear Operators via Multigrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a concise neural operator architecture for operator learning. Drawing an analogy with a conventional fully connected neural network, we define the neural operator as follows: the output of the $i$-th neuron in a nonlinear operator layer is defined by $O_i(u) = \sigma\left( \sum_j W_{ij} u + B_{ij}\right)$. Here, $ W_{ij}$ denotes the bounded linear operator connecting $j$-th input neuron to $i$-th output neuron, and the bias $ B_{ij}$ takes the form of a function rather than a scalar. Given its new universal approximation property, the efficient parameterization of the bounded linear operators between two neurons (Banach spaces) plays a critical role. As a result, we introduce MgNO, utilizing multigrid structures to parameterize these linear operators between neurons. This approach offers both mathematical rigor and practical expressivity. Additionally, MgNO obviates the need for conventional lifting and projecting operators typically required in previous neural operators. Moreover, it seamlessly accommodates diverse boundary conditions. Our empirical observations reveal that MgNO exhibits superior ease of training compared to other CNN-based models, while also displaying a reduced susceptibility to overfitting when contrasted with spectral-type neural operators. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method with consistently state-of-the-art performance on different types of partial differential equations (PDEs).</description>

      <title>Investigating the Combinatorial Potential and Applicability of Random Equation Systems with Mixture Models in a Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating solutions of nonlinear equation systems is challenging in a general framework, especially if the equations contain uncertainties about parameters modeled by probability densities. Such random equations, understood as stationary (non-dynamical) equations with parameters as random variables, have a long history and a broad range of applications. In this work, we study nonlinear random equations by combining them with mixture model parameter random variables in order to investigate the combinatorial complexity of such equations and how this can be utilized practically. We derive a general likelihood function and posterior density of approximate best fit solutions while avoiding significant restrictions about the type of nonlinearity or mixture models, and demonstrate their numerically efficient application for the applied researcher. In the results section we are specifically focusing on example simulations of approximate likelihood/posterior solutions for random linear equation systems, nonlinear systems of random conic section equations, as well as applications to portfolio optimization, stochastic control and random matrix theory in order to show the wide applicability of the presented methodology.</description>
