      <title>Norms in equivariant homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\infty$-category of normed algebras in genuine $G$-spectra, as introduced by Bachmann-Hoyois, is modelled by strictly commutative algebras in $G$-symmetric spectra for any finite group $G$. We moreover provide an analogous description of Schwede's ultra-commutative global ring spectra in higher categorical terms.
  Using these new descriptions, we exhibit the $\infty$-category of ultra-commutative global ring spectra as a partially lax limit of the $\infty$-categories of genuine $G$-spectra for varying $G$, in analogy with the non-multiplicative comparison of Nardin, Pol, and the second author.
  Along the way, we establish various new results in parametrized higher algebra, which we hope to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The K-theory cochains of H-spaces and height 1 chromatic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix an odd prime $p$. Let $X$ be a pointed space whose $p$-completed K-theory $\mathrm{KU}_p^*(X)$ is an exterior algebra on a finite number of odd generators; examples include odd spheres and many H-spaces. We give a generators-and-relations description of the $\mathbf{E}_\infty$-$\mathrm{KU}_p$-algebra spectrum $\mathrm{KU}_p^{X_+}$ of $\mathrm{KU}_p$-cochains of $X$. To facilitate this construction, we describe a $\mathrm{K}(1)$-local analogue of the Tor spectral sequence for $\mathbf{E}_1$-ring spectra. Combined with previous work of Bousfield, this description of the cochains of $X$ recovers a result of Kjaer that the $v_1$-periodic homotopy type of $X$ can be modelled by these cochains. This then implies that the Goodwillie tower of the height 1 Bousfield-Kuhn functor converges for such $X$.</description>

      <title>Analysing Multiscale Clusterings with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04281v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data clustering, it is often desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions that describes the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.</description>

      <title>The discrete flow category: structure and computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we use concepts and methods from the theory of simplicial sets to study discrete Morse theory. We focus on the discrete flow category introduced by Vidit Nanda, and investigate its properties in the case where it is defined from a discrete Morse function on a regular CW complex. We design an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hom posets of the discrete flow category in this case. Furthermore, we show that in the special case where the discrete Morse function is defined on a simplicial complex, then each Hom poset has the structure of a face poset of a regular CW complex. Finally, we prove that the spectral sequence associated to the double nerve of the discrete flow category collapses on page 2.</description>

      <title>The category of $\pi$-finite spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of truncated spaces with finite homotopy invariants ($\pi$\=/finite spaces) has many of the features expected of an elementary \oo topos. It should be thought of as the natural higher analogue of the elementary 1-topos of finite sets, with which it shares several initiality properties. The paper has also an appendix about univalent families in \oo pretopoi.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Topological Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.</description>
