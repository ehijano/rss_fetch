      <title>Ensemble Monte Carlo Calculations with Five Novel Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce five novel types of Monte Carlo (MC) moves that brings the number of moves of ensemble MC calculations from three to eight. So far such calculations have relied on affine invariant stretch moves that were originally introduced by Christen (2007), 'walk' moves by Goodman and Weare (2010) and quadratic moves by Militzer (2023). Ensemble MC methods have been very popular because they harness information about the fitness landscape from a population of walkers rather than relying on expert knowledge. Here we modified the affine method and employed a simplex of points to set the stretch direction. We adopt the simplex concept to quadratic moves. We also generalize quadratic moves to arbitrary order. Finally, we introduce directed moves that employ the values of the probability density while all other types of moves rely solely on the location of the walkers. We apply all algorithms to the Rosenbrock density in 2 and 20 dimensions and to the ring potential in 12 and 24 dimensions. We evaluate their efficiency by comparing error bars, autocorrelation time, travel time, and the level of cohesion that measures whether any walkers were left behind. Our code is open source.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Profiling of Ladder Polymer Structure using Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ladder polymers, known for their rigid, ladder-like structures, exhibit exceptional thermal stability and mechanical strength, positioning them as candidates for advanced applications. However, accurately determining their structure from solution scattering remains a challenge. Their chain conformation is largely governed by the intrinsic orientational properties of the monomers and their relative orientations, leading to a bimodal distribution of bending angles, unlike conventional polymer chains whose bending angles follow a unimodal Gaussian distribution. Meanwhile, traditional scattering models for polymer chains do not account for these unique structural features. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations to address this challenge. We first develop a Monte Carlo simulation for sampling the configuration space of ladder polymers, where each monomer is modeled as a biaxial segment. Then, we establish a machine learning-assisted scattering analysis framework based on Gaussian Process Regression. Finally, we conduct small-angle neutron scattering experiments on a ladder polymer solution to apply our approach. Our method uncovers structural details of ladder polymers that conventional methods fail to capture.</description>

      <title>Quantum-centric computation of molecular excited states with extended sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of molecular electronic structure is an important application of quantum devices. Recently, it has been shown that quantum devices can be effectively combined with classical supercomputing centers in the context of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) algorithm. This allowed the largest electronic structure quantum simulation to date (77 qubits) and opened near-term devices to practical use cases in chemistry toward the hundred-qubit mark. However, the description of many important physical and chemical properties of those systems, such as photo-absorption/-emission, requires a treatment that goes beyond the ground state alone. In this work, we extend the SQD algorithm to determine low-lying molecular excited states. The extended-SQD method improves over the original SQD method in accuracy, at the cost of an additional computational step. It also improves over quantum subspace expansion based on single and double electronic excitations, a widespread approach to excited states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices, in both accuracy and efficiency. We employ the extended SQD method to compute the first singlet (S$_1$) and triplet (T$_1$) excited states of the nitrogen molecule with a correlation-consistent basis set, and the ground- and excited-state properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster.</description>

      <title>Transition Path and Interface Sampling of Stochastic Schr\"odinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rare transitions in Markovian open quantum systems driven with Gaussian noise, applying transition path and interface sampling methods to trajectories generated by stochastic Schr\"odinger dynamics. Interface and path sampling offer insights into rare event transition mechanisms while simultaneously establishing a quantitative measure of the associated rate constant. Here, we extend their domain to systems described by stochastic Schr\"odinger equations. As a specific example, we explore a model of quantum Brownian motion in a quartic double well, consisting of a particle coupled to a Caldeira-Leggett oscillator bath, where we note significant departures from the Arrhenius law at low temperatures due to the presence of an anti-Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Transmission of mobility via cooperative mechanisms in soft active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When supercooled, liquids viscosity increases dramatically as the glass transition temperature is approached. While the physical origin of this behavior is still not understood, it is now well established that the addition of a few activated particles is able to reverse that increase in viscosity. Here we further raise the question of a limit in that fluidization process and of the differences between the fluidized liquid and its viscous counterpart. Results show that a few percent active molecules are enough to trigger a phase transition leading to diffusion coefficients typical of liquids while the medium retains cooperative properties of the viscous phase. The similarity between cooperative properties of the active and non active molecules suggests that the mobility of active molecules is transmitted to inactive ones via the medium cooperative mechanisms, a result in agreement with facilitation theories. This result is then confirmed by the compared behavior of the distinct van hove correlation functions of most mobile active and non active molecules. Interestingly enough, in our simulations the cooperative mechanisms are not induced or related to a decrease of the excitation concentration.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Node Positioning in Biological Transport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological transport networks are highly optimized structures that ensure power-efficient distribution of fluids across various domains, including animal vasculature and plant venation. Theoretically, these networks can be described as space-embedded graphs, and rich structures that align well with observations emerge from optimizing their hydrodynamic energy dissipation. Studies on these models typically use regular grids and focus solely on edge width optimization. Here, we present a generalization of the hydrodynamic graph model which permits additional optimization of node positioning. We achieve this by defining sink regions, accounting for the energy dissipation of delivery within these areas, and optimizing by means of differentiable physics. In the context of leaf venation patterns, our method results in organic networks that adapt to irregularities of boundaries and node misalignment, as well as overall improved efficiency. We study the dependency of the emergent network structures on the capillary delivery conductivity and identify a phase transition in which the network collapses below a critical threshold. Our findings provide insights into the early formation of biological systems and the efficient construction of transport networks.</description>

      <title>Calculations of Chern number: equivalence of real-space and twisted-boundary-condition formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04164v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chern number is a crucial invariant for characterizing topological feature of two-dimensional quantum systems. Real-space Chern number allows us to extract topological properties of systems without involving translational symmetry, and hence plays an important role in investigating topological systems with disorder or impurity. On the other hand, the twisted boundary condition (TBC) can also be used to define the Chern number in the absence of translational symmetry. Based on the perturbative nature of the TBC under appropriate gauges, we derive the two real-space formulae of Chern number (namely the non-commutative Chern number and the Bott index formula), which are numerically confirmed for the Chern insulator and the quantum spin Hall insulator. Our results not only establish the equivalence between the real-space and TBC formula of the Chern number, but also provide concrete and instructive examples for deriving the real-space topological invariant through the twisted boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo/Moments micro-macro Parareal method for unimodal and bimodal scalar McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a micro-macro parallel-in-time Parareal method for scalar McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the algorithm, the fine Parareal propagator is a Monte Carlo simulation of an ensemble of particles, while an approximate ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the mean and the variance of the particle distribution is used as a coarse Parareal propagator to achieve speedup. We analyse the convergence behaviour of our method for a linear problem and provide numerical experiments indicating the parallel weak scaling of the algorithm on a set of examples. We show, with numerical experiments, that convergence typically takes place in a low number of iterations, depending on the quality of the ODE predictor. For bimodal SDEs, we avoid quality deterioration of the coarse predictor (compared to unimodal SDEs) through the usage of multiple ODEs, each describing the mean and variance of the particle distribution in locally unimodal regions of the phase space. The benefit of the proposed algorithm can be viewed through two lenses: (i) through the parallel-in-time lens, speedup is obtained through the use of a very cheap coarse integrator (an ODE moment model), and (ii) through the moment models lens, accuracy is iteratively gained through the use of parallel machinery as a corrector. In contrast to the isolated use of a moment model, the proposed method (iteratively) converges to the true distribution generated by the SDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians provides access to an important set of chemical properties. Wavefunctions based on ML architectures have shown promise in approximating these ground states in a variety of physical systems. In this work, we show how to achieve state-of-the-art energies for molecular Hamiltonians using the the neural network backflow wave-function. To accomplish this, we optimize this ansatz with a variant of the deterministic optimization scheme based on SCI introduced by [Li, et. al JCTC (2023)] which we find works better than standard MCMC sampling. For the molecules we studied, NNBF gives lower energy states than both CCSD and other neural network quantum states. We systematically explore the role of network size as well as optimization parameters in improving the energy. We find that while the number of hidden layers and determinants play a minor role in improving the energy, there is significant improvements in the energy from increasing the number of hidden units as well as the batch size used in optimization with the batch size playing a more important role.</description>

      <title>Classical Post-processing for Unitary Block Optimization Scheme to Reduce the Effect of Noise on Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Trustworthy and Energy-Efficient Predictive Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our work on developing and training scalable, trustworthy, and energy-efficient predictive graph foundation models (GFMs) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets consisting of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as energy and atomic forces. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of many of these experiments relies on understanding how the spin of unpaired electrons exchanges energy with their environment, or lattice, and relaxes to equilibrium. In this work, we overcome the common use of effective spin Hamiltonians to describe spin-lattice relaxation in spin-1/2 and apply ab initio open quantum systems theory to their full molecular electronic wavefunction. Simulations for two Cr(V) coordination compounds under this framework show a dramatic improvement in accuracy and demonstrate that relaxation in spin-1/2 molecules is enabled by virtual transitions to molecular excited states with energy approaching 20,000 cm$^{-1}$. This work establishes a connection between the original theory of Van Vleck and modern electronic structure methods, ultimately exemplifying the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to spin-lattice relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations.

      <title>CrysToGraph: A Comprehensive Predictive Model for Crystal Materials Properties and the Benchmark</title>

Abstract: The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n $\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.</description>

      <title>Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However, this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems. In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations.</description>
