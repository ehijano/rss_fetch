      <title>Towards Strong AI: Transformational Beliefs and Scientific Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong artificial intelligence (AI) is envisioned to possess general cognitive abilities and scientific creativity comparable to human intelligence, encompassing both knowledge acquisition and problem-solving. While remarkable progress has been made in weak AI, the realization of strong AI remains a topic of intense debate and critical examination. In this paper, we explore pivotal innovations in the history of astronomy and physics, focusing on the discovery of Neptune and the concept of scientific revolutions as perceived by philosophers of science. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple theoretical and statistical framework of weak beliefs, termed the Transformational Belief (TB) framework, designed as a foundation for modeling scientific creativity. Through selected illustrative examples in statistical science, we demonstrate the TB framework's potential as a promising foundation for understanding, analyzing, and even fostering creativity -- paving the way toward the development of strong AI. We conclude with reflections on future research directions and potential advancements.</description>

      <title>An Undergraduate Course on the Statistical Principles of Research Study Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The undergraduate curriculum in statistics and data science is undergoing changes to accommodate new methods, newly interested students, and the changing role of statistics in society. Because of this, it is more important than ever that students understand the role of study design and how to formulate meaningful scientific and statistical research questions. While the traditional Design of Experiments course is still extremely valuable for students heading to industry and research careers, a broader study design course that incorporates survey sampling, observational studies, and the basics of causal inference with randomized experiment design is particularly useful for students with a wide range of applied interests. Here, I describe such a course at a small liberal arts college, along with ways to adapt it to meet different student and instructor background and interests. The course serves as a valuable bridge to advanced statistical coursework, meets key statistical literacy and communication learning goals, and can be tailored to the desired level of computational and mathematical fluency. Through reading, discussing, and critiquing actual published research studies, students learn that statistics is a living discipline with real consequences and become better consumers and producers of scientific research and data-driven insights.</description>
