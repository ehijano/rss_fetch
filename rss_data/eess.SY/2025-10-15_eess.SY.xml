      <title>Quantum Deception: Honey-X Deception using Quantum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for deception in quantum games, extending the Honey-X paradigm from classical zero-sum settings into the quantum domain. Building on a view of deception in classical games as manipulation of a player's perception of the payoff matrix, we formalize quantum deception as controlled perturbations of the payoff Hamiltonian subject to a deception budget. We show that when victims are aware of possible deception, their equilibrium strategies surprisingly coincide with those of naive victims who fully trust the deceptive Hamiltonian. This equivalence allows us to cast quantum deception as a bilevel optimization problem, which can be reformulated into a bilinear semidefinite program. To illustrate the framework, we present simulations on quantum versions of the Penny Flip game, demonstrating how quantum strategy spaces and non-classical payoffs can amplify the impact of deception relative to classical formulations.</description>

      <title>Sleepy Chauffeur Detection and Alert Techniques for Road Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most startling of the contemporary problems is the sleepiness of chauffeur which causes lots of car accidents. Prevention of those impending accidents by detecting and alerting the sleepy chauffeur is vital, otherwise that would lead to loss of lives and various traumas along with severe injuries. The slumber or sleep may be caused by huge stress, pressure, relentless work load or alcoholism, for which sleep deprivation occurs and the chauffeur while driving gets drowsy. So far, considerable amount of systems has been developed to detect drowsiness of drivers, most of which mainly depend on image processing algorithms using cameras. Some of them also incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning based algorithms. This paper presents a review of the existing systems and also proposes an easy and cheap system using sensors and Arduino, capable of detecting sleepiness and generates siren alarm and send alert message to take precautionary measures.</description>

      <title>Empowering Prosumers: Incentive Design for Local Electricity Markets Under Generalized Uncertainty and Grid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the 1990s, widespread introduction of central (wholesale) electricity markets has been seen across multiple continents, driven by the search for efficient operation of the power grid through competition. The increase of renewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and distribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to the latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon emissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring flexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers or smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of large-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity markets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not account for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we propose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational marginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production, consumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid using the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty using general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in the day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for every timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot) prices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a trivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive case-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize end-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior does not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale EV Smart Charging Considering Distribution Network Voltage Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Grid Impedance Identification in $dq$-Asymmetric Three-Phase Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal $dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies, while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($&lt;1$ s) identification, drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear superiority over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>A Unidirectionally Connected FAS Approach for 6-DOF Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unidirectionally connected fully actuated system (UC-FAS) approach for the sub-stabilization and tracking control of 6-DOF quadrotors, tackling limitations both in state-space and FAS framework to some extent. The framework systematically converts underactuated quadrotor dynamics into a UC-FAS model, unifying the existing different FAS transformation ways. By eliminating estimation of the high-order derivatives of control inputs, a drawback of current methods, the UC-FAS model simplifies controller design and enables direct eigenstructure assignment for closed-loop dynamics. Simulations demonstrate precise 6-DOF tracking performance. This work bridges theoretical FAS approach advancements with practical implementation needs, offering a standardized paradigm for nonlinear quadrotor control.</description>

      <title>Pooling Probabilistic Forecasts for Cooperative Wind Power Offering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind power producers can benefit from forming coalitions to participate cooperatively in electricity markets. To support such collaboration, various profit allocation rules rooted in cooperative game theory have been proposed. However, existing approaches overlook the lack of coherence among producers regarding forecast information, which may lead to ambiguity in offering and allocations. In this paper, we introduce a ``reconcile-then-optimize'' framework for cooperative market offerings. This framework first aligns the individual forecasts into a coherent joint forecast before determining market offers. With such forecasts, we formulate and solve a two-stage stochastic programming problem to derive both the aggregate offer and the corresponding scenario-based dual values for each trading hour. Based on these dual values, we construct a profit allocation rule that is budget-balanced and stable. Finally, we validate the proposed method through empirical case studies, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and theoretical soundness.</description>

      <title>High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</description>

      <title>Optimising Communication Control Factors for Energy Consumption in Rural LOS V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links, especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at $\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower $P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive, energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural V2X systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Estimation with Limited Data Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robust Multi-Market Participation of Renewable-Based VPPs through Flexible Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transition toward a sustainable power system, renewable-based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets. Their viability, however, depends on effective market participation strategies and the ability to manage uncertainties while leveraging flexible resources. This paper analyzes the impact of different flexible resources - such as concentrated solar power plants, hydro plants, biomass plants, and flexible demand - on the participation of RVPPs in energy and reserve markets. Multiple sources of uncertainty in generation, consumption, and electricity prices are addressed using a two-stage robust optimization approach. The contribution of different technologies to RVPP profitability is evaluated through a marginal contribution method, ensuring fair allocation of profits among them according to their actual role in energy and reserve provision across markets. Simulations for an RVPP in southern Spain demonstrate how strategic decisions and the availability of flexible resources influence viability, market participation, and unit scheduling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Terrain-Aware Path Planning: Integrating VD--RRT\(^{*}\) Exploration and VD--D\(^{*}\) Lite Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties. The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner, the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</description>

      <title>The value of storage in electricity distribution: The role of storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge, provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local distribution needs.</description>

      <title>Micro-Macro Backstepping Control of Large-Scale Hyperbolic Systems (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a control design and analysis framework for micro-macro, boundary control of large-scale, $n+m$ hyperbolic PDE systems. Specifically, we develop feedback laws for stabilization of hyperbolic systems at the micro level (i.e., of the large-scale system) that employ a) measurements obtained from the $n+m$ system (i.e., at micro level) and kernels constructed based on an $\infty+\infty$ continuum system counterpart (i.e., at macro level), or b) kernels and measurements both stemming from a continuum counterpart, or c) averaged-continuum kernels/measurements. We also address (d)) stabilization of the continuum (macro) system, employing continuum kernels and measurements. Towards addressing d) we derive in a constructive manner an $\infty+\infty$ continuum approximation of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems and establish that its solutions approximate, for large $n$ and $m$, the solutions of the $n+m$ system. We then construct a feedback law for stabilization of the $\infty+\infty$ system via introduction of a continuum-PDE backstepping transformation. We establish well-posedness of the resulting 4-D kernel equations and prove closed-loop stability via construction of a novel Lyapunov functional. Furthermore, under control configuration a) we establish that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable provided that $n$ and $m$ are large, by proving that the exact, stabilizing $n+m$ control kernels can be accurately approximated by the continuum kernels. While under control configurations b) and c), we establish closed-loop stability capitalizing on the established solutions' and kernels' approximation properties via employment of infinite-dimensional ISS arguments. We provide two numerical simulation examples to illustrate the effectiveness and potential limitations of our design approach.</description>

      <title>DarTwin made precise by SysMLv2 -- An Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new SysMLv2 adds mechanisms for the built-in specification of domain-specific concepts and language extensions. This feature promises to facilitate the creation of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and interfacing with existing system descriptions and technical designs. In this paper, we review these features and evaluate SysMLv2's capabilities using concrete use cases. We develop DarTwin DSL, a DSL that formalizes the existing DarTwin notation for Digital Twin (DT) evolution, through SysMLv2, thereby supposedly enabling the wide application of DarTwin's evolution templates using any SysMLv2 tool. We demonstrate DarTwin DSL, but also point out limitations in the currently available tooling of SysMLv2 in terms of graphical notation capabilities. This work contributes to the growing field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) for DTs and combines it with the release of SysMLv2, thus integrating a systematic approach with DT evolution management in systems engineering.</description>

      <title>Temporal Variabilities Limit Convergence Rates in Gradient-Based Online Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental performance limits of gradient-based algorithms for time-varying optimization. Leveraging the internal model principle and root locus techniques, we show that temporal variabilities impose intrinsic limits on the achievable rate of convergence. For a problem with condition ratio $\kappa$ and time variation whose model has degree $n$, we show that the worst-case convergence rate of any minimal-order gradient-based algorithm is $\rho_\text{TV} = (\frac{\kappa-1}{\kappa+1})^{1/n}$. This bound reveals a fundamental tradeoff between problem conditioning, temporal complexity, and rate of convergence. We further construct explicit controllers that attain the bound for low-degree models of time variation.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Agile Flight Control with Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount. Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees, enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver Models of Molecular Quantum Dot Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) may provide low-power, high-speed computational hardware for processing classical information. Simulation and modeling play an important role in the design of QCA circuits because fully-coherent models of QCA scale exponentially with the number of devices, and such models are severely limited in size. For larger circuits, approximations become necessary. In the era of fault-tolerant quantum computation, however, it may become possible to model large QCA circuits without such limitations. Presently, this work explores the use of the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method for estimating the ground state of QCA circuits. This is relevant because the computational result of a QCA calculation is encoded in the circuit's ground state. In this study, VQE is used to model logic circuits, including binary wires,
  inverters, and majority gates. VQE models are performed ideal simulators, noisy simulators, and actual quantum hardware. This study demonstrates that VQE may indeed be used to model molecular QCA circuits. It is observed that using modern NISQ hardware, results are still quite sensitive to noise, so measures should be taken to minimize noise. These include simplifying the ansatz circuit whenever possible, and using low-noise hardware.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Legged Mobile Manipulation for Lunar Surface Operations via Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking, achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of 8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints, exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for future lunar missions.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Millimeter Wave Communications for Indoor Scenarios: Modeling and Coverage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are two critical technologies for next-generation networks, especially in dense indoor environments. However, existing analyses often oversimplify the indoor environment by neglecting some of the key characteristics, such as height variations, boundary effects, blockage effects, and user spatial distributions. In this paper, we develop an improved stochastic geometry-based model for RIS-assisted mmWave communications in indoor scenarios like conference centers, hospitals, and shopping malls. The proposed model incorporates the height factor for all the nodes in the network (e.g., transmitters, users, RISs, and obstacles) and captures the user clustering behavior in these scenarios. In addition, the boundary effect is also being considered for line-of-sight (LOS) probability calculation. Analytical expressions for distance distributions, LOS probabilities, and the coverage probability (CP) are derived. The CP is then validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal deployment insights by approximating and simplifying the derived CP expressions, showing how transmitter density, obstacle density, RIS density, and user cluster radius impact network coverage. Notably, we show that RISs significantly improve coverage when transmitters or transmit power are limited but offer marginal benefits when transmitter density is high. These findings provide practical guidelines for the design and deployment of RIS-assisted indoor mmWave networks.</description>

      <title>A Cyber Insurance Policy for Hedging Against Load-Altering Attacks and Extreme Load Variations in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04287v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte-Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE-118 test bus system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeders model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive DRL for IRS Mirror Orientation in Dynamic OWC Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate line-of-sight (LoS) blockages and enhance signal coverage in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems with minimal additional power. In this work, we consider a mirror-based IRS to assist a dynamic indoor visible light communication (VLC) environment. We formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate by adjusting the orientation of the IRS mirrors. To enable real-time adaptability, the problem is modelled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is developed based on the deterministic policy gradient for real-time mirror-based IRS optimization in dynamic VLC networks. The proposed DRL is employed to optimize mirror orientation toward mobile users under blockage and mobility constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DRL algorithm outperforms the conventional deep Q- learning (DQL) algorithm and achieves substantial improvements in sum rate compared to random-orientation IRS configurations</description>

Abstract: Worsening global challenges in the Anthropocene demand complex, adaptive solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. However, existing modeling approaches often fall short due to disciplinary silos, limited scalability, and the absence of shared ontological frameworks. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), when integrated with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), offers a powerful methodology for modeling systems of systems while preserving subsystem heterogeneity and enabling cross-disciplinary integration. This paper presents the first application of the MBSE-HFGT methodology to environmental systems, using a series of worked examples involving flow through lake and land segments. These examples demonstrate how the approach enables consistent, scalable, and integrative modeling of complex environmental processes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Decentralized Queue Disclosure for Impatient Tenants in Edge and Non-terrestrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how queue-state information disclosures affect impatient tenants in multi-tenant edge systems. We propose an information-bulletin strategy in which each queue periodically broadcasts two Markov models. One is a model of steady-state service-rate behavior and the other a model of the queue length inter-change times. Tenants autonomously decide to renege or jockey based on this information. The queues observe tenant responses and adapt service rates via a learned, rule-based predictive policy designed for decentralized, partially-observed, and time-varying environments. We compare this decentralized, information-driven policy to the classical, centralized Markov Decision Process (MDP) hedging-point policy for M/M/2 systems. Numerical experiments quantify the tradeoffs in average delay, impatience and robustness to stale information. Results show that when full, instantaneous state information and stationarity hold, the hedging-point policy yields less impatience but this diminishes as information becomes partial or stale. The rule-based predictive policy on the other hand is more robust to staleness in dispatched information, making it conducive for conditions typical of edge cloud and non-terrestrial deployments.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data visualization is essential for developing an understanding of a complex system. The power grid is one of the most complex systems in the world and effective power grid research visualization software must 1) be easy to use, 2) support unique data that may arise in research, and 3) be capable of creating custom figures for publication and presentation. However, no current software addresses all three of these needs. PowerPlots is an open-source data visualization tool for power grids that does address these needs. In addition, several tools created to support this software facilitate the analysis of power grid data by transforming the data into graph topology or data-frame data formats that are more compatible for some analyses. In this work, we use PowerPlots to investigate several case studies that involve exploring power grid data. These case studies demonstrate the valuable insights that are possible when using network visualization and how it can be applied to research applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization of High-Order Quarter-Wave Plate for Birefringence Suppression in FOCS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber optic current sensors (FOCS) are widely adopted in modern power grids due to high sensitivity, excellent insulation, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. This prominence necessitates precise investigation into their error sources and corresponding optimization. This study examines reflective FOCS based on the Faraday effect. A theoretical model is established to simulate phase error caused by linear birefringence from the quarter-wave plate. Conventional methods using circular birefringence are analyzed, revealing inherent limitations. Innovatively, a compensation strategy employing high-order quarter-wave plates is proposed to effectively eliminate linear birefringence effects. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and practicality of FOCS in precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Eco-driving Incentive Mechanisms for Mitigating Emissions in Urban Transportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops incentive mechanisms for promoting eco-driving with the overarching goal of minimizing emissions in transportation networks. The system operator provides drivers with energy-efficient driving guidance throughout their trips and measures compliance through vehicle telematics that capture how closely drivers follow this guidance. Drivers optimize their behaviors based on personal trade-offs between travel times and emissions. To design effective incentives, the operator elicits driver preferences regarding trip urgency and willingness to eco-drive, while determining optimal budget allocations and eco-driving recommendations. Two distinct settings based on driver behavior are analyzed. When drivers report their preferences truthfully, an incentive mechanism ensuring obedience (drivers find it optimal to follow recommendations) is designed by implementing eco-driving recommendations as a Nash equilibrium. When drivers may report strategically, the mechanism is extended to be both obedient and truthful (drivers find it optimal to report truthfully). Unlike existing works that focus on congestion or routing decisions in transportation networks, our framework explicitly targets emissions reduction by incentivizing drivers. The proposed mechanism addresses both strategic behavior and network effects arising from driver interactions, without requiring the operator to reveal system parameters to the drivers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effects of budget constraints, driver types, and strategic misreporting on equilibrium outcomes and emissions reduction.</description>

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model. While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research investigates whether Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) can outperform conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in the diagnosis of electrical and mechanical faults from vibration and acoustic data.
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as LeakyReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in induction motor condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Product-oriented Product-Process-Resource Asset Network and its Representation in AutomationML for Asset Administration Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00933</link>

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and (ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating the impacts of the end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This paper proposes a modeling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource (PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) incorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>
