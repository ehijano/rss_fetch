      <title>A log story short: running contributions to radiative Higgs decays in the SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the renormalization of the radiative decays of the Higgs to two gauge bosons in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory at mass dimension eight. Given that these are loop-level processes, their one-loop renormalization can be phenomenologically important when triggered by operators generated through the tree-level exchange of heavy particles (assuming a weakly coupled UV model). By computing the tree-level matching conditions of all relevant extensions of the Standard Model, we demonstrate that this effect is indeed present in the $h\to \gamma Z$ decay at dimension eight, even though it is absent at dimension six. In contrast, the $h\to gg$ and $h\to \gamma\gamma$ decays can only be renormalized by operators generated by one-loop processes. For UV models with heavy vectors, this conclusion hinges on the specific form of their interaction with massless gauge bosons which is required for perturbative unitarity. We study the quantitative impact of the possible logarithmic enhancement of $h\to \gamma Z$, and we propose an observable to boost the sensitivity to this effect. Given the expected increased precision of next-generation high-energy experiments, this dimension-eight contribution could be large enough to be probed and could therefore give valuable clues about new physics by revealing some of its structural features manifesting first at dimension eight.</description>

      <title>Three-loop corrections to Higgs boson pair production: reducible contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections to the process $gg\to HH$ originating from one-particle reducible diagrams. This requires the computation of two-loop corrections to the gluon-gluon-Higgs vertex with an off-shell gluon. We describe in detail our approach to obtain semi-analytic results for the vertex form factors and present results for the two form factors contributing to Higgs boson pair production.</description>

      <title>Parity nonconservation induced by spacetime geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of fermion spin with spacetime can be non-universal, leading to a new interaction beyond the Standard Model, independent of gravitation. Fermions generate spacetime torsion, which can be integrated out in favor of a four-fermion interaction in a torsion-free background. This is a current-current interaction which involves all fermions and generically has different coupling constants for different chiralities and species of fermions. It does not vanish when curvature goes to zero, so accelerator experiments should be able to see its effect. We calculate the contribution of this geometrical interaction to parity nonconservation in $e^-e^-$ and $e^-D$ scattering and compare with known observations. This provides an estimate of an upper bound on the coupling constants, suggesting that the strength of the ``new physics'' can be as large as only one order of magnitude smaller than that of weak interactions.</description>

      <title>Supernova Neutrinos: flavour conversion mechanisms and new physics scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core-collapse supernova (SN) releases almost all of its energy in the form of neutrinos, which provide a unique opportunity to probe the working machinery of a SN. These sites are prone to neutrino-neutrino refractive effects, which can lead to fascinating collective flavour oscillations among neutrinos. This causes rapid neutrino flavour conversions deep inside the SN even for suppressed mixing angles, with intriguing consequences for the explosion mechanism as well as nucleosynthesis. We review the physics of collective oscillations of neutrinos -- both slow and fast, along with the well-known resonant flavour conversion effects, and discuss the current state-of-the-art of the field. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrinos from a SN can be used to probe novel particle physics properties, extreme values of which are otherwise inaccessible in laboratories.</description>

      <title>On the viability of the QCD axion - dark energy transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This conference thesis summarizes my presentation at Tartu Tuorla Cosmology meeting based on a collaborative work with E.Nardi and C.Smarra \cite{Muursepp:2024mbb}. It is well known that a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson (pNGB) coupled to a confining gauge group obtains a non-zero contribution to its mass through instanton effects. At non-zero temperature, this manifests in temperature-dependent mass $m^{2}(T) \propto T^{-n}$. If these particles come to dominate the energy density of the Universe in the non-relativistic regime they would accelerate the expansion of the Universe for $n&gt;2$, thus providing a dark energy (DE) component. In this work, we outline a scenario in which a pNGB $\phi_{b}$ presently undergoing confinement could realize such a scenario. Using energetic considerations we find that $\phi_{b}$ alone is not enough to produce the experimentally observed amount of DE. However, coupling $\phi_{b}$ to the QCD axion $\phi_a$ allows the transfer of energy from the QCD axion to the pNGB via non-adiabatic level-crossing thus reproducing the observed amount of dark matter (DM) and DE.</description>

      <title>Two-Higgs Doublet Model Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the general two-Higgs doublet model effective field theory where the effects of additional new physics are parameterized by operators up to mass dimension-six. We further transform this effective theory to the Higgs basis and provide matching of the Wilson coefficients between the two descriptions. We illustrate the advantages of the Higgs basis which include the separation of operators that modify standard model couplings and masses from operators that contribute to scattering processes only, transparent correlations between scattering processes resulting from the same operator, and derivation of correlations between different operators in specific UV completions. For completeness, we also construct specific versions corresponding to four types of two-Higgs doublet models: type-I, -II, -X, and -Y, distinguished by $Z_2$ symmetries which restrict the couplings of the Higgs doublets to standard model fermions. Furthermore, we derive general vacuum and stability conditions of the scalar potential in the presence of higher-dimensional terms.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the transverse phase space parton distribution functions and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the effects of polarization effects from both initial and final state photons.</description>

      <title>Isospin sum rules for the nonleptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry, as the most precise flavor symmetry, could be used to extract information of hadronic dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian of bottom quark weak decay is zero under the isospin lowering operators $I_-^n$, which permits us to generate isospin sum rules through several master formulas. In this work, we derive the master formulas of isospin sum rules for the two- and three-body non-leptonic decays of $B$ mesons. The isospin sum rules can be used to test of isospin symmetry and provide hints the isospin partners of exotic hadrons in the $B$ decays. It is found the isospin breaking could reach to be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ in some decay modes. And the charm tetraquark resonances might be observed in the $ B^- \to J/\Psi \pi^-\overline K^0$, $\overline B^0 \to J/\Psi \overline K^0\phi$ and $\overline B^0\to D^0\overline D^0\overline K^0$ modes according to the isospin symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Nearest-neighbor Expansion of Lepton Flavor Mixing in Powers of the $\mu$-$\tau$ Permutation Symmetry Breaking Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the observed pattern of lepton flavor mixing can be well described by a proper nearest-neighbor expansion of a constant $3\times 3$ unitary matrix in powers of a small parameter characterizing the fine effect of $\mu$-$\tau$ permutation symmetry breaking. We take an example of this kind for illustration, and provide complete discussions on the usefulness in the study of leptonic CP violation and unitarity triangles in matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining Gluonic Contact Interaction of a Neutrino-philic Dark Fermion at Hadron Colliders and Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly interacting fermion with the Standard Model particles is a promising candidate of the genuine dark matter. In this paper, we study signatures of the gluonic interactions of a dark fermion and a neutrino at hadron colliders and direct detection experiments. The lowest order interactions are described by contact operators in dimension 7. At hadron colliders, the mono-jet production is the most sensitive channel. And these operators can also induce both spin-independent and spin dependent absorption of the dark fermion at nuclear target. We show that for a nearly massless dark fermion, the energy scales are constrained to be higher than 500 GeV and 1.2 TeV by the current LHC and HE-LHC searches, respectively. Furthermore, we also find that almost all the parameter space accessible by the spin-independent absorption has been excluded by the current LHC constraints. In contrast, for spin-dependent absorption at light nuclear target there is still some parameter space which can not be reached by current and upcoming LHC searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized uncertainty principles are effective changes to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that emerge in several quantum gravity models. In the present letter, we study the consequences that two classes of these modifications yield on the physics of neutrinos. Besides analyzing the change in the oscillation probabilities that the generalized uncertainty principles entail, we assess their impact on the neutrino coherence length and their possible interpretation as nonstandard neutrino interactions. Constraints cast by present and planned neutrino experiments on the generalized uncertainty principles parameters are also derived.</description>

      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are much shorter than the year-long exposures obtained by NICER on some individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Folk wisdom dictates that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>Convolutional L2LFlows: Generating Accurate Showers in Highly Granular Calorimeters Using Convolutional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20407v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations on D-Wave's {\tt Advantage} Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small number of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos. Two approaches to improving the qubit-scaling are discussed, but only one of the two shows promise.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that the running coupling remains of moderate size at infrared scales. We obtain a simple flux-tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>Scale hierarchies near the conifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the axio-dilaton and complex structure stabilization for a generic one-parameter Calabi-Yau (CY) compactification. We focus on near the conifold regions and consider a strongly warped metric. We analyze numerically the case of the mirror of the quintic CY. The axio-dilaton $\tau$ and complex structure $z$ moduli are stabilized simultaneously comparing with previous results, showing that generically $z$ is heavier than $\tau$, and the axio-dilaton can not be fixed first. This is also the case when we add the warping correction to the potential; and in general this inclusion does not destabilize the moduli. We point out why in this setup non-supersymmetric vacua are much more dense than supersymmetric vacua. We study the dependence of the vacua stabilization by addition of an $\overline{D3}$-brane, for a fixed volume. The vacuum state masses have divergent eigenvalues near the conifold singularity that gets softened by the warping correction. Generically the considered contributions allow to find stable vacua in this setup. The scale hierarchy between 6D and 4D; arising from the warping, as stated by Giddings Kachru and Polchinski (GKP), is preserved; while the masses in the vacua acquire physically reasonable values.</description>

      <title>On the number of Regge trajectories for dual amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>

      <title>New Signature of low mass $Z^\prime$ in $J/\psi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a new approach to search for a low-mass $Z^{\prime}$ particle through $J/\psi$ decays by identifying its existence through parity-violating phenomena in the isospin-violating final states of $\Lambda\overline{\Sigma}^{0}$ and the corresponding charge conjugated states of $\overline{\Lambda}\Sigma^{0}$. Our investigation centers on a generation-independent and leptophobic $Z^{\prime}$ with its mass below 10 GeV. Given the present experimental conditions at the Beijing Spectrometer III~(BESIII) and the anticipated opportunities at the Super Tau Charm Factory~(STCF), we conduct Monte-Carlo simulations to predict possible events at both facilities. Notably, we foresee a substantial enhancement in the precision of the lower limit estimation of $\alpha_{\text{NP}}$ as well as a reduction in statistical uncertainty with upcoming STCF experiments. Furthermore, it is essential to highlight that a null result in the measurement of $\alpha_{\text{NP}}$ would impose stringent constraints, requiring the $Z^{\prime}-q-q$ couplings to be on the order of $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Matter Sum Rules in models with a single extra-dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a set of sum rules needed for KK-graviton pair production from matter in orbifolded extra-dimensional models. The sum rules can be found in full generality by considering the properties of solutions to the Sturm-Liouville problem, which describes the wave functions and the masses of the KK-gravitons in four dimensions. They ensure cancellations in the amplitudes of the processes mentioned above which considerably reduce their growth with $s$ in the high-energy limit. This protects extra-dimensional theories from the low-scale unitarity problems that plague other theories with massive spin-2 particles. We argue that such relations are valid for a broader category of models thus generalizing our previous results that were limited to the large $\mu$ limit of the Randall-Sundrum model.</description>

      <title>Confronting electroweak MSSM through one-loop renormalized neutralino-Higgs interactions for dark matter direct detection and muon $(g-2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the vertices where a pair of the lightest neutralino couples to CP-even (light or heavy) Higgs scalars. In particular, the lightest neutralino is assumed to be a dominantly Bino-like mixed state, composed of Bino and Higgsino or Bino, Wino, and Higgsino. After computing all the three-point functions in the electroweak MSSM, we detail the contributions from the counterterms that arise in renormalizing these vertices in one-loop order. The amendment of the renormalized vertices impacts the spin-independent direct detection cross-sections of the scattering of nucleons with dark matter. We perform a comprehensive numerical scan over the parameter space where all the points satisfy the present B-physics constraints and accommodate the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. Finally, we exemplify a few benchmark points, which indulge the present searches of supersymmetric particles. After including the renormalized one-loop vertices, the spin-independent DM-nucleon cross-sections may be enhanced up to $20\%$ compared to its tree-level results. Finally, with the NLO cross-section, we use the recent LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) results on the neutralino-nucleon scattering to display the relative rise in the lowest allowed band of the Higgsino mass parameter in the $M_1-\mu$ plane of the electroweak MSSM.</description>

      <title>Searching for exclusive leptoquarks with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio composite model at the LHC and HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study concerning a new physics scenario involving four fermion operators of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type characterized by a strong-coupling ultraviolet fixed point where composite particles are formed as bound states of elementary fermions at the scale $\Lambda ={\cal O}(\text{TeV})$. After implementing the model in the Universal FeynRules Output format, we focus on the phenomenology of the scalar leptoquarks at the LHC and the High-Luminosity option. Leptoquark particles have undergone extensive scrutiny in the literature and experimental searches, primarily relying on pair production and, more recently, incorporating single, t-channel, and lepton-induced processes. This study marks, for the first time, the examination of these production modes at varying jet multiplicities. Novel mechanisms emerge, enhancing the total production cross-section, especially for leptoquarks couplings to higher fermion generations. A global strategy is devised to capture all final state particles produced in association with leptoquarks or originating from their decay, which we termed ``exclusive'', in an analogy to the nomenclature used in nuclear reactions. The assessment of the significance in current and future LHC runs, focusing on the case of leptoquark coupling to a muon - $\textit{c}$ quark pair, reveals superior sensitivity compared to ongoing searches. Given this heightened discovery potential, we advocate the incorporation of exclusive leptoquark searches in future investigations at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a phenomenological comparison of the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum expected from cosmic gauge string networks and superstring networks comprised of multiple string types. We show how violations of scaling behavior and the evolution of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe affect the GW spectrum. We derive simple analytical expressions for the GW spectrum from superstrings and gauge strings that are valid for all frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and laser interferometers. We analyze the latest data from PTAs and show that superstring networks are consistent with 32 nHz data from NANOGrav, but are excluded by 3.2 nHz data at $3\sigma$ unless the string coupling $g_s&lt;0.2$ or the strings evolve in only about 10\% of the volume of the higher-dimensional space. We also point out that while gauge string networks are excluded by NANOGrav-15 data at $3\sigma$, they are completely compatible with EPTA and PPTA data. Finally, we study correlations between GW signals at PTAs and laser interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results are presented for the medium-induced, soft coherent radiation spectrum for all $2\to 2$ partonic channels in QCD, at leading-order in $\alpha_s$ but beyond leading logarithmic accuracy. The general formula is valid in the full kinematic range of the underlying process, and reduces to previous results in special cases. The soft gluon radiation spectrum is expressed in terms of the color density matrix specific to each channel, quantifying the entanglement between the color components of the $2 \to 2$ production amplitude. Beyond the leading logarithm, the spectrum depends explicitly on the off-diagonal elements of this matrix, owing to the soft gluon's ability to probe the internal color structure of the parton pair.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of TMD parton distributions in Drell-Yan and $Z^0$ boson production in a hadron structure oriented approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first practical implementation of a recently proposed hadron structure oriented (HSO) approach to TMD phenomenology applied to Drell-Yan like processes, including lepton pair production at moderate $Q^2$ and $Z^0$ boson production. We compare and contrast general features of our methodology with other common practices and emphasize the improvements derived from our approach that we view as essential for applications where extracting details of nonperturbative transverse hadron structure is a major goal. These include the HSO's preservation of a basic TMD parton-model-like framework even while accounting for full TMD factorization and evolution, explicit preservation of the integral relationship between TMD and collinear pdfs, and the ability to meaningfully compare different theoretical models of nonperturbative TMD parton distributions. In our examples, we show that there is significant sensitivity at moderate $Q^2$ to both the form of the nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence and the parametrization of collinear parton densities. However, we also find that evolving to $Q^2 = M_Z^2$, without fitting, results in a satisfactory postdiction of existing data for $Z^0$ production, nearly independently of the modeling of nonperturbative transverse momentum behavior. We argue that this demonstrates that moderate $Q$ measurements should be given greater weight than high $Q$ measurements in extractions of nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence. We also obtain new extractions of the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel within the HSO approach. We discuss its features and compare with some earlier extractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider (ILC) will allow the precise study of $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow q\bar{q}$ interactions at different center-of-mass energies from the $Z$-pole to 1 TeV. In this paper, we discuss the experimental prospects for measuring differential observables in $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ at the ILC baseline energies, 250 and 500 GeV. The study is based on full simulation and reconstruction of the International Large Detector (ILD) concept. Two gauge-Higgs unification models predicting new high-mass resonances beyond the Standard Model are discussed. These models predict sizable deviations of the forward-backward observables at the ILC running above the $Z$ mass and with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams. The ability of the ILC to probe these models via high-precision measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry is discussed. Alternative scenarios at other energies and beam polarization schemes are also discussed, extrapolating the estimated uncertainties from the two baseline scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next$-$to$-$minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) featuring constrained mSUGRA model, has the capability to inherently anticipate a light dark matter component within the existing limitations encompassing Higgs data, sparticle$-$mass constraints, dark matter exploration, muon g-2. We examine neutralino dark matter within the NMSSM framework by conducting a comprehensive analysis of its parameter space. This involves evaluating neutralino capture and annihilation rates within the Sun. The exploration of potential detection strategies for neutralino dark matter in neutrino experiments hinges on the composition of neutralinos and their primary annihilation pathways. Our study also involves reassessing the maximum thresholds for branching ratios of lepton flavour violation decays $BR(\mu\rightarrow e+\gamma)$, $BR(\tau\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ by directly referencing the constrained limits on $ \Delta a_{\mu} $ from $ g_{\mu}-2 $ experiment. This work also presents constraints of muon flux, photon, positron and antiproton flux, specifically its independence from experimental intricacies and the universal applicability of recalculation coefficients across NMSSM model. Within the scope of this research, we have chosen to utilize this NMSSM scenario as a case study to investigate the funnel$-$ annihilation mechanisms pertaining to light dark matter and the concealed Higgs decay. In this particular scenario, our findings reveal that there exist decay channel$-$annihilation mechanisms for the lightest supersymmetric particle $ \tilde{\chi_{1}^{0}} $, which include the $h_{2}, h_{1}, Z, W^{+}, W^{-}, G, s, S, b, B, c, C, a, A, d, D, l, L $ decay funnels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD-like theories in which the dark matter (DM) of the Universe is hypothesized to be a thermal relic in the form of a dark pion has been extensively investigated, with most studies neglecting the CP-violating $\theta$-angle associated with the topological vacuum. We point out that a non-vanishing $\theta$ could potentially trigger resonant number-changing processes giving rise to the observed relic density in agreement with perturbative unitarity as well as observations of clusters of galaxies. This constitutes a novel production mechanism of MeV DM and an alternative to those relying on the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. Moreover, for specific meson mass spectra, similar resonant scatterings serve as a realization of velocity-dependent self-interacting DM without a light mediator. Explicit benchmark models are presented together with a discussion of possible signals, including gravitational waves from the chiral phase transition associated with the dark pions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-Like $B$ quark (VLB) via the process $pp \to B(\to bZ)j\to b(Z \to \nu_l\bar{\nu_l})j$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e., $m_B &gt; 1500 \text{ GeV}$. We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the $B$ quark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0.5$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).</description>

Abstract: According to the inflationary theory of cosmology, most elementary particles in the current universe were created during a period of reheating after inflation. In this work we self-consistently couple the Einstein-inflaton equations to a strongly coupled quantum field theory (QFT) as described by holography. We show that this leads to an inflating universe, a reheating phase and finally a universe dominated by the QFT in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The improved saturation model in nuclei</title>

Abstract: We consider the nuclear shadowing in deep-inelastic scattering corresponding to kinematic regions accessible by future experiments at electron-ion colliders. The gluon distribution at small $x$ is obtained using an improved dipole model depended on the impact parameter for atomic nucleus and compared with nCETQ15 parametrization group. The nuclear shadowing at small $x$ is defined within the color dipole formalism with respect to the mass number $A$. Its behavior is predicted for light nuclei in a wide range of the impact parameter $b$ and the transverse dipole size $r$. The nuclear saturation at large-$r$ (small $\mu^2$) is observable. The behavior of the nuclear ratio $\sigma^{A}_{\mathrm{dip}}/\sigma_{0}$ is similar to the Golec-Biernat-W$\ddot{\mathrm{u}}$sthoff (GBW) model in a wide range of $r$ for light and heavy nuclei at small $x$.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential energy from a time-dependent scalar field provides a possible explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration. In this paper, we investigate how data from supernova and bary acoustic oscillation surveys constrain the possible evolution of a single scalar field over the period of time (roughly half the age of the universe) for which these data are available. Taking a linear approximation to the scalar potential $V(\phi) = V_0 + V_1 \phi$ around the present value, a likelihood analysis appears to significantly prefer models with a decreasing potential energy at present, with approximately $99.99 \%$ of the $\exp(-\chi^2/2)$ distribution having $V_1 &gt; 0$ in a convention where $\dot{\phi} \le 0$ at present. The models favoured by the distribution typically have an order one decrease $\langle |{\rm Range}[V(\phi(t))] / V(t_0)| \rangle \approx 0.36$ in the scalar potential energy over the time frame corresponding to $z &lt; 2$. According to the likelihood analysis, the $\Lambda$CDM model with no variation in dark energy appears to be significantly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential model, but this should be interpreted cautiously since model selection criteria that make use of $\Delta \chi^2$ while ignoring parameter space volumes still favour $\Lambda$CDM. Working with a second order approximation to the potential, the supernova data can be fit well for a wide range of possible potentials, including models where the universe has already stopped accelerating.</description>

      <title>On energy and particle production in cosmology: the particular case of the gravitino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the number of particles produced in cosmology, commonly defined in the literature from the Fock space of the instantaneous hamiltonian of the canonically normalized fields, is ambiguous. On the other hand, the energy computed from the energy-momentum tensor should be physical. We compare the corresponding Fock spaces and relate them through a Bogolyubov transformation. We find that for particles of spin $0$, $1$ and $3/2$ the two Fock spaces are different, whereas they are the same for spin $1/2$ fermions. For spin $0$ and $1$, for particles of high momenta the two Fock spaces align, as intuitively expected. For the spin $3/2$, one finds two puzzles. The first one is that the two corresponding Fock spaces do not match even in the limit of high momenta. The second is that whereas we provide evidence for the equivalence theorem between longitudinal gravitinos and the goldstino in terms of an exact matching between the lagrangians and the instantaneous hamiltonians for the canonically normalized fields, the energy operator computed from the Rarita--Schwinger action does not seem to be captured in a simple way by the goldstino action. Our results suggest a re-analysis of non-thermal gravitino production in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication to nano-hertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Advancing Set-Conditional Set Generation: Diffusion Models for Fast Simulation of Reconstructed Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational intensity of detector simulation and event reconstruction poses a significant difficulty for data analysis in collider experiments. This challenge inspires the continued development of machine learning techniques to serve as efficient surrogate models. We propose a fast emulation approach that combines simulation and reconstruction. In other words, a neural network generates a set of reconstructed objects conditioned on input particle sets. To make this possible, we advance set-conditional set generation with diffusion models. Using a realistic, generic, and public detector simulation and reconstruction package (COCOA), we show how diffusion models can accurately model the complex spectrum of reconstructed particles inside jets.</description>
