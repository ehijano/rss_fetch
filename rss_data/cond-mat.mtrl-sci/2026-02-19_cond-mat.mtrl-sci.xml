      <title>A fully differentiable framework for training proxy Exchange Correlation Functionals for periodic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling of Anisotropic Strength Surfaces from Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a unified framework for inferring, representing, and statistically characterizing an anisotropic strength surface directly from molecular dynamics data. Large-scale tensile loading simulations are used to generate failure data across all principal stress ratios and loading orientations, facilitated by a data-driven mapping between imposed strain-rate tensors and resulting stresses. The orientation-dependent strength surface is then represented using a constrained parametric formulation in which the surface parameters vary smoothly with loading angle through a low-dimensional functional encoding. To deploy the framework, we specifically consider the case of monocrystalline graphene, which is a prototypical two-dimensional material that has been extensively characterized, both experimentally and computationally, in the literature. For defective graphene, multiple random realizations of vacancy defect distributions are used to construct a stochastic ensemble of angular strength surfaces. Because each anisotropic strength surface requires substantial atomistic sampling to construct, the resulting ensemble is inherently limited in size, motivating the use of compact encoding, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling to characterize strength variability. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis reveals a condensed latent representation of the fitted, encoded surfaces, where a Gaussian mixture model is employed to capture defect-induced variability, including rare outlier behaviors arising from clustered vacancy defects. Sampling from this probabilistic model enables the generation of new, physically admissible strength surfaces and the construction of confidence intervals in both parameter space and stress space.

      <title>Twist-induced Out-of-plane Ferroelectricity in Bilayer Hafnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO2 is a promising candidate for next-generation memory devices due to its CMOS compatibility and ability to retain polarization at nanometer scales. However, the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca2_1) responsible for ferroelectricity is metastable and requires extrinsic stabilization, which makes it challenging for integration with silicon. We predict that bilayer 1T-HfO2 can exhibit robust and switchable out-of-plane (OOP) polarization arising from stacking-induced symmetry breaking. Using first-principles density functional theory, we predict that monolayer 1T-HfO2 can be cleaved from the (111) surface of cubic hafnia, and the monolayer is dynamically stable. When two aligned monolayers are twisted to form a moir\'e superlattice, it breaks the interlayer symmetry and allows the emergence of bistable OOP polarization. At a twist angle of 7.34o, the system exhibits a net polarization of ~16 {\mu}C/cm2. This sizeable polarization is due to the large polar displacements concentrated in AB stacking domains. Importantly, this polarization can be reversibly switched via interlayer sliding with a low energy barrier (~8 meV/formula unit) and comparable low coercive field (~0.2 V/nm), offering electric-field tunability. These findings establish twisted bilayer 1T-HfO2 as a scalable and robust 2D ferroelectric platform, enabling new pathways for integrating ferroelectric functionality into atomically thin memory and logic devices.</description>

      <title>Ligand Mediated Magnetoelectronic Coupling Across Metamagnetic Transitions in CrPS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium thiophosphate is a long-known material: a layered semiconducting antiferromagnet. Its recently discovered gate-tunable metamagnetic phase transitions, the remarkable positive and oscillating magnetoresistance as a tunnel barrier, and its Fano-resonance luminescence, elusive among the multitude of Cr3+ compounds, call for revisiting the understanding of its electronic structure, especially regarding how it relates to magnetic order. Here, we employ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, implemented in both absorption and resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopies, together with quantum many-body calculations, to unveil the complex nature of magnetoelectronic coupling in CrPS4, featuring hybridization between crystal-field and charge-transfer transitions. We reveal the role of extended superexchange paths involving P and S atoms, mediating interactions between the Cr spins across the different magnetic phases: antiferromagnetic, canted, and ferromagnetic. Our results elucidate the electronic states involved in these phases and provide prescriptions for engineering the metamagnetic phase diagram of CrPS4.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Estimation of 3D Atomic Coordination from Near-Edge Spectra via Equivariant Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting 3D atomic coordinates from spectroscopic data is a longstanding inverse problem. We present an equivariant diffusion model that generates site-specific 3D structures directly from near-edge spectra (ELNES/XANES). Trained on Si-O crystals, the model achieves radial accuracy comparable to Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) (RMSD ~0.06 {\AA}) but with superior coordination number precision (errors &lt; 4.3% vs. EXAFS ~20%). Crucially, it reconstructs full 3D geometries including bond angles, overcoming the limitations of 1D radial distribution analysis. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, accurately predicting local structures in amorphous systems despite being trained exclusively on crystalline lattices. Application to experimental O K-edge spectra from {\alpha}-quartz validates practical applicability. This generative approach outperforms template matching and establishes automated, quantitative 3D structure determination from spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-ledge coupling drives non-conservative migration of semicoherent precipitate interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitate shape and size control the strength and stability of many structural alloys, yet the microscopic mechanism by which semicoherent precipitate interfaces migrate remains unclear. In particular, how dense interfacial dislocation networks move while accommodating transformation strain has resisted direct, time-resolved characterization. Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution.</description>

      <title>Negative Strain-Rate Sensitivity in Metallic Glasses Driven by Rejuvenation-Relaxation Competition: Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations and a Minimal Effective Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) is negative in metallic glasses, the material becomes weaker as the deformation rate increases, leading to accelerated plastic deformation and, eventually, catastrophic fracture. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the negative SRS using micromechanics-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that couple heterogeneous randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) models for metallic glasses. The model accounted for both the thermomechanical structural rejuvenation and relaxation of the energy barrier for thermal activation of STZs, incorporating a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)-type relaxation function. The present simulations systematically reproduce the dependence of flow stresses on strain rate, temperature, and the form of the relaxation function. The SRS tends to decrease at high strain rates and low temperatures in the simulations, and negative SRS appears when a compressed-exponential relaxation function is employed. Shear localization also appears; however, the conditions under which the observed localization emerges do not fully coincide with those leading to the negative SRS, leaving the dominant factor unclear. To clarify the dominant factor, we introduce a simplified theoretical model that reproduces flow stresses consistent with the simulation results. An analytical expression derived from the theoretical model reveals that negative SRS originates primarily from the temporal evolution of the activation barrier. Specifically, negative SRS arises when the timescale of external loading exceeds that of STZ relaxation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and quantifying the topology-dependent pre-melting of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The melting of metallic nanoparticles is governed by surface pre-melting, a phenomenon traditionally modeled as the isotropic growth of a uniform liquid shell. Challenging this classical view, we report facet-dependent surface pre-melting in hexagonal close-packed Co nanoparticles, arising from the structural heterogeneity of the nanoparticle surface. Characterizing melting in molecular dynamics simulations (500 to 6000 atoms), we observe the onset of surface mobility, starting as low as $0.2\times T_{M,\infty}$ (the bulk melting point), driven by the early disordering of stepped $\{01\bar{1}1\}$ facets. We found that these facets consistently melt at temperatures nearly 200 Kelvin lower than flat $\{0001\}$ facets, regardless of particle size, and relate facets melting temperatures to the nanoparticle size via a 2D extension of the Gibbs-Thomson relation. We determine a critical liquid layer thickness that triggers the melting of the entire nanoparticle, which is found to be size-dependent. Our results confirm the recent experimental observation of the surface pre-melting effect, and extend it to anisotropic particles with different facet orientations.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Structure Refinement of X-ray Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce WPEM, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\ce{PbSO4} and \ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition of a multiphase Ti--15Nb thin film, quantitative recovery of \ce{NaCl}--\ce{Li2CO3} mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous halos in semicrystalline polymers, high-throughput operando lattice tracking in layered cathodes, automated refinement of a compositionally disordered Ru--Mn oxide solid solution (CCDC 2530452), and quantitative phase-resolved deciphering of an ancient Egyptian make-up sample from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.</description>

      <title>Hidden universality in dislocation-loops mediated three-dimensional crystal melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>When Is Structural Lubricity Load Independent? The Role of Contact Geometry and Elastic Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations of an incommensurate Au(111)/graphite interface, we investigate the conditions under which structural lubricity produces load-independent friction. We show that strict load independence occurs only in laterally infinite, area-filling contacts, where dissipation is governed by phonon-mediated viscous coupling and the shear stress scales linearly with sliding velocity. Finite contacts with explicit boundary terminations exhibit substantially higher friction yet remain load independent up to a critical load. Load dependence arises only when elastic out-of-plane deformation near the contact line exceeds a critical amplitude, activating additional dissipation channels. These results demonstrate that contact geometry and local elastic compliance, rather than normal load itself, determine the onset and breakdown of load-independent structural lubricity.</description>

      <title>Thermal Decoherence and Population Transfer of MeV Channeling Electrons in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\langle100\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of an oxide: insights into the phase diagram of bismuth oxide on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth oxide (Bi$_2$O$_3$) is a polymorphic material of considerable technological interest, with applications spanning from heterogeneous catalysis to next-generation nanoelectronics. Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance.</description>

      <title>Addressing Ill-conditioning in Density Functional Theory for Reliable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In principle, machine learning (ML) can be used to obtain any electronic property of a many-body system from its electron density within density functional theory. However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometry Dependent Properties of Cerium Hydride: An Active Learning Developed Interatomic Potential Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerium hydride has a variety of interesting properties, including a known lattice contraction and densification with increasing hydrogen content. However, precise stoichiometric control is not experimentally straightforward and {\it ab initio} approaches are not computationally feasible for many properties such as melting and low temperature diffusion. Therefore, we develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for cerium hydride that is valid for H to Ce ratios from 2.0 to 3.0. A query-by-committee active learning approach is used to develop the training set. Leveraging classical molecular dynamics simulations, we assess a range of properties and provide fundamental mechanisms for the trends with stoichiometry. A majority of the properties follow the trend of lattice contraction, being governed by the stronger lattice binding induced by adding octahedral atoms.</description>

      <title>Understanding the influence of yttrium on the dominant twinning mode and local mechanical field evolution in extruded Mg-Y alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twinning is a primary deformation mechanism in Mg alloys. This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for &lt;c+a&gt; slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Universal Framework for Decomposing Ionic Transport into Interpretable Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of ion transport in bulk materials is central to designing next-generation ion conductors for energy storage devices, yet studies employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) have largely been limited to reporting overall transport coefficients without a quantitative, spatiotemporally resolved breakdown of \emph{how} charge is carried. We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery.</description>

      <title>Growth and crystallographic structure of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111): From sub-monolayer structures to single- and multi-layer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the initial growth of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111) from sub-monolayer to multi-layer coverage by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction intensity analysis (LEED-IV), and density functional theory (DFT). In the submonolayer regime we find a stable and well-ordered $(5\times\sqrt{3})_{\mathrm{rect}}$ superstructure consisting of separated TiTe$_2$ molecules, whereby the Ti atoms substitute Au atoms of the first substrate layer as proven by LEED-IV. By adding further Ti and Te in a 1:2 ratio and proper annealing dealloying sets in and a homogeneous 1T-TiTe$_2$ monolayer film on an unreconstructed substrate is formed. The resulting moir\'e structure is close to a $(4 \times 4)$ superstructure w.r.t. Au(111) and has a slightly expanded in-plane lattice parameter compared to the 1T-TiTe$_2$ bulk value. With further stoichiometric deposition, thicker 1T-TiTe$_2$ films grow. Surprisingly, a five layer thick film exhibits an even larger lattice-parameter (1.5 % larger than the bulk value). All LEED-IV analyses are based on best-fit R-factors of $R \le 0.13$.</description>

      <title>Understanding the kinetics of static recrystallization in Mg-Zn-Ca alloys using an integrated PRISMS simulation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recrystallization is a phenomenon in which a plastically deformed polycrystalline microstructure with a high dislocation density transforms into another that has low dislocation density. This evolution is driven by the stored energy in dislocations, rather than grain growth driven by grain boundary energy alone. One difficulty in quantitative modeling of recrystallization is the uncertainty in material parameters, which can be addressed by integration of experimental data into simulations. In this work, we compare simulated static recrystallization dynamics of a Mg-3Zn-0.1Ca wt.% alloy to experiments involving thermomechanical processing followed by measurements of the recrystallization fraction over time. The simulations are performed by combining PRISMS software for crystal plasticity and phase-field models (PRISMS-Plasticity and PRISMS-PF, respectively) in an integrated computational materials engineering framework. At 20% strain and annealing at 350 {\deg}C, the model accurately describes recrystallization dynamics up to a mobility-dependent time scale factor. While the average grain boundary mobility and the fraction of plastic work converted into stored energy are not precisely known, by fitting simulations to experimental data, we show that the average grain boundary mobility can be determined if the fraction of plastic work converted to stored energy is known, or vice versa. For low annealing temperatures, we observe a discrepancy between the model and experiments in the late stages of recrystallization, where a slowdown in recrystallization kinetics occurs in the experiments. We discuss possible sources of this slowdown and propose additional physical mechanisms that need to be accounted for in the model to improve its predictions.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap and Flat Bands in a Niobium Oxyiodide Cluster Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic devices depend critically on the dielectric materials from which they are made, with higher refractive indices and lower absorption losses enabling new functionalities and higher performance. However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Stripe antiferromagnetism in van der Waals metal HoTe3 decoupled from charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $R\mathrm{Te}_3$ ($R = \text{rare earth}$) family of layered van der Waals (vdW) compounds hosts coexisting magnetic and charge density wave (CDW) orders, yet the interplay between these degrees of freedom remains little explored. Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively. In contrast to the CDW-driven exotic magnetism in $\mathrm{DyTe}_3$, $\mathrm{TbTe}_3$, and $\mathrm{GdTe}_3$, we find no evidence for coupling between magnetism and CDW in $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$. The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems.</description>

      <title>Why the Casimir Force for Magnetic Metals Computed by the Lifshitz Theory Using the Drude Model Disagrees with the Measurement Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir force in configurations with magnetic metal plates and analyze the reasons why the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the dielectric permittivity of the Drude model are inconsistent with the measurement data. For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed.</description>

      <title>Confinement Epitaxy of Large-Area Two-Dimensional Sn at the Graphene/SiC Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement epitaxy beneath graphene stabilizes exotic material phases by restricting vertical growth and altering lateral diffusion, conditions unattainable on bare substrates. However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms.</description>

We prove that, in the large-$S$ limit, the asymptotic form of the partition function coincides with that of a classical model for spins of length $S_C=\sqrt{S(S+1)}$. Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians. As an application, the classical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute transition temperatures for several topical materials with known interaction parameters, including MnF$_2$, MnTe, Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, MnPSe$_3$, FePS$_3$, FePSe$_3$, CoPS$_3$, CrSBr, and CrI$_3$. The resulting transition temperatures show good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Exciton-Selective Phonon Coupling in a Lead Halide Perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the optical response of semiconductors, yet disentangling multiple coupling channels in lead halide perovskites remains challenging. We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Fluid Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.</description>

Abstract: Mercury telluride is a canonical material for realizing topological phases, yet a full understanding of its electronic structure remains challenging due to subtle competing effects. Using first-principles calculations and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modelling, we study its topological phase diagram under strain. We show that linearly $k$-dependent higher-order $C_4$ strain terms are essential for capturing the correct low-energy behaviour. These terms lead to a nontrivial $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting arising from the interplay of strain and bulk inversion asymmetry. This explains the camel-back feature in the tensile regime and supports the emergence of a Weyl semimetal phase under compressive strain.</description>

      <title>Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization: equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescales. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we show that linearly polarized laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization between otherwise identical sublattices in the $d$-wave compensated altermagnet (AM) RuO$_2$, resulting in a \textit{photo-induced ferrimagnetic state} with a strong net magnetization of $\sim$0.2 $\mu_B$ per unit cell. The sign and magnitude of this metastable magnetization are highly controllable by laser polarization. We identify polarization-selective asymmetric optical intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) as the primary mechanism generating the net moment, followed by asymmetric spin flips (a-SF) that further amplifies it. Both effects originate from the characteristic nodal spin band topology of \textit{d}-wave AMs. Moreover, we demonstrate that this laser-induced magnetization is universal across various $d$-wave AMs, including experimentally confirmed KV$_2$Se$_2$O and RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. We uncover a robust route to light-controlled magnetization in AMs on ultrafast timescales.</description>

Abstract: The local environment of Mn atoms in stoichiometric Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloys was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and interpreted with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In cubic austenite, the significant amount of structural defects was observed in \mn NMR experiments and interpreted using DFT calculations as individual antisite defects or defects accompanying anti-phase boundaries.

      <description>arXiv:2507.23329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shandite structure hosts transition metal ions arranged in kagome layers. These layers are stacked rhombohedrally and are interspersed with post-transition metal ions and chalcogens. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by the transition metal $d$-orbitals and feature saddle points near several of the high-symmetry positions of the Brillouin zone, most notably the F and L points. Combining symmetry considerations with ab initio methods, we study the electronic and structural properties of these materials with an emphasis on the connection between electronic saddle points at specific momenta and structural instabilities at these momenta. While the parent compounds studied are all found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions, we show that, in specific compounds, moving the saddle point closer to the Fermi level using either hydrostatic pressure or doping, can induce a structural instability. The importance of the electronic degrees of freedom in driving this instability is supported by the dependence of the frequency of the soft phonon mode on the electronic smearing temperature. Our first-principles calculations show that as the smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable again, indicating that the electron-phonon coupling is playing an important role. Our findings survey the structural properties of a large family of shandite materials and shed light on the role played by saddle points in the electronic structure in driving structural instabilities in rhombohedrally stacked kagome-layered materials.</description>

      <title>In situ elucidation of mechanisms governing crack transition to plasticity arrest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical treatment of short- to long-crack transitions, direct experimental quantification of how elastic and plastic energy contributions evolve at the crack tip during arrest has remained absent. In this study, we present an in situ investigation of crack propagation in cold-worked AA-5052 using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). By reconstructing local crack-tip fields from measured displacement data, we extract mode I and II stress intensity factors and both elastic and elastoplastic energy release rates ({\Delta}JE and {\Delta}Jp). The results show that microstructure-sensitive cracks propagate in a mixed-mode manner at low driving force and transition to plasticity-dominated and load-aligned crack, arrested as the crack-tip process zone develops and expands multiple grains. This transition is identified through the divergence of elastic and elastoplastic energy measures ({\Delta}JE &gt;= {\Delta}JP), crack-tip blunting, slip-band emission, and the emergence of localised plastic deformation. These findings demonstrate that crack arrest coincides with a measurable transition in crack-tip energy partitioning and with process-zone expansion beyond grain-scale dimensions. The results establish an experimentally measurable energy-partition criterion for crack arrest and demonstrate that fracture regime transition is governed by</description>

      <title>Laser-generated GHz surface acoustic waves with tunable amplitude during the magnetostructural phase transition in FeRh thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune the SAW parameters such as amplitude is crucial to achieve acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phasechanging magnetic materials that accommodate both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is the FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature that undergoes a phase transition to the ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper, we use the phase transition in a 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via the photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during the phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to the AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it, allowing for control of the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamic parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening on a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.</description>

Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast laser radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are evaluated: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.</description>

Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K-ion intercalation in Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) is a well-established charge storage mechanism in potassium-ion batteries; here, we demonstrate that this same ion intercalation process is the basis for nanoscale resistive switching behavior in PBA-base memristive devices. Using C-AFM, we directly visualize and electrically control this intercalation process within sub-100 nm volumes, revealing reversible, localized conductance modulation driven by K-ion intercalation and Fe^(2+)/Fe^(3+) redox reconfiguration. This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their single-step, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s. This unprecedented speed establishes PBAs as a distinct, high-rate class of K-ion intercalation memristors suitable for fast, high-density neuromorphic and memory applications.</description>

Abstract: Growing stress-free epitaxial films by van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is of interest for realizing flexible optoelectronics and energy devices from freestanding epilayers. However, vdWE of non-layered materials is often presumed or claimed on layered substrates such as mica with inadequate experimental evidence. Here, we demonstrate that the growth of single-domain rocksalt ScN(111) films by sputter deposition on fluorophlogopite mica(001) occurs by conventional epitaxy. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal the film/substrate epitaxial relationship to be [-101](111)ScN||[010](001)mica. Our results indicating strain buildup seen from the dependence of (111) interplanar spacings, and strain relaxation by dislocation generation, question prior claims of vdWE of non-layered metal nitrides on mica. Our findings show that conventional epitaxy should be the default assumption for non-layered materials unless conditions for vdWE are explicitly established.</description>

      <title>The extensive photo response on metal/n-Si clarified by the zero-gap with inter-band phonon scatterings</title>

Abstract: UVA to NIR with multi-directional photo responses have been found on metal (Au)/n-Si device. A reasonable explanation has not been found in various physical models of Si-devices for the phenomena. We approached a zero-gap at X (reciprocal point) in two conduction bands of Si to analysis the optical response with the inter-band phonon scatterings. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-$\Gamma$ and X-W successfully simulated the sensitivities in visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the carrier density profile well fitted the response in NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Filling up the zero-gap by doping electrons ($\sim 10^{18}$/cm$^3$) at around X, a lower limit of 0.6 eV arose in the measurement below Si-band gap of 1.17 eV. Indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with phonon scattering, gave a variety of directional photo-responses. The carrier scattering model for the inter bands (X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L) were consistent with the directional dependence of photo-currents under UVA (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.06 eV) excitations. Band to band scatterings assisted to extend the available optical range and increase its variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle, a new frontier will be opened in the photo-conversion system by using indirect-transition semiconductors and thus, it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekul\'e ordering in moir\'e graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekul\'e modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</description>

      <title>Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12887</link>

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.</description>

      <title>Effects of interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the shape and dynamics of magnetic twin-skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.</description>
