      <title>$C^{ 0,1}$ -It{\^o} chain rules and generalized solutions of parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we first establish an It\^o formula for a finite quadratic variation process $X$ expanding $f(t,X_t),$ when $f$ is of class $C^2$ in space and is absolutely continuous in time. Second, via a Fukushima-Dirichlet decomposition we obtain an explicit chain rule for $f(t,X_t)$, when $X$ is a continuous semimartingale and $f$ is a ``quasi-strong solution'' (in the sense of approximation of classical solutions) of a parabolic PDE.</description>

      <title>Measure-Valued CARMA Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine continuous-time autoregressive moving-average (CARMA) processes on Banach spaces driven by L\'evy subordinators. We show their existence and cone-invariance, investigate their first and second order moment structure, and derive explicit conditions for their stationarity. Specifically, we define a measure-valued CARMA process as the analytically weak solution of a linear state-space model in the Banach space of finite signed measures. By selecting suitable input, transition, and output operators in the linear state-space model, we show that the resulting solution possesses CARMA dynamics and remains in the cone of positive measures defined on some spatial domain. We also illustrate how positive measure-valued CARMA processes can be used to model the dynamics of functionals of spatio-temporal random fields and connect our framework to existing CARMA-type models from the literature, highlighting its flexibility and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Any random variable with right-unbounded distributional support is the minimum of independent and very heavy-tailed random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random variable X has a light-tailed distribution (for short: is light-tailed) if it possesses a finite exponential moment, E \exp (cX) is finite for some c&gt;0, and has a {\it heavy-tailed} distribution (is heavy-tailed) if E \exp (cX) is infinite, for all c&gt;0. Leipus, Siaulys and Konstantinides (2023) presented a particular example of a light-tailed random variable that is the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. We show that this phenomenon is universal: any light-tailed random variable with right-unbounded support may be represented as the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. Moreover, a more general fact holds: these two independent random variables may have as heavy-tailed distributions as one wishes. Further, we extend the latter result onto the minimum of any finite number of independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Geometric lower bounds for the steady-state occupancy of processing networks with limited connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider processing networks where multiple dispatchers are connected to single-server queues by a bipartite compatibility graph, modeling constraints that are common in data centers and cloud networks due to geographic reasons or data locality issues. We prove lower bounds for the steady-state occupancy, i.e., the complementary cumulative distribution function of the empirical queue length distribution. The lower bounds are geometric with ratios given by two flexibility metrics: the average degree of the dispatchers and a novel metric that averages the minimum degree over the compatible dispatchers across the servers. Using these lower bounds, we establish that the asymptotic performance of a growing processing network cannot match that of the classic Power-of-$d$ or JSQ policies unless the flexibility metrics approach infinity in the large-scale limit.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behaviour of the random connection model on hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random connection model on hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$ in dimension $d=2,3$. Vertices of the spatial random graph are given as a Poisson point process with intensity $\lambda&gt;0$. Upon variation of $\lambda$ there is a percolation phase transition: there exists a critical value $\lambda_c&gt;0$ such that for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ all clusters are finite, but infinite clusters exist for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_c$. We identify certain critical exponents that characterize the clusters at (and near) $\lambda_c$, and show that they agree with the mean-field values for percolation. We derive the exponents through isoperimetric properties of critical percolation clusters rather than via a calculation of the triangle diagram.</description>

      <title>Probability and Structure of Quota Violations in the Huntington-Hill Apportionment Method for 3 States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apportionment problem asks how to assign representation to states based on their populations. That is, given census data and a fixed number of seats, how many seats should each state be assigned? Various algorithms exist to solve the apportionment problem. This paper focuses on the \textit{Huntington-Hill method}, which is the apportionment method used in the United States to apportion 435 seats in the House of Representatives to the 50 states every ten years. This paper presents a detailed analysis of quota violations that can arise under the Huntington-Hill apportionment method when allocating $M$ seats among $n=3$ states. The study begins by establishing general theoretical results about the behavior of the method, particularly focusing on the types of quota violations that may occur and the mechanisms by which they arise. Building on this foundation, the paper introduces a test designed to detect quota violations. This test is then employed to construct a probability function, which calculates the likelihood of such violations occurring, given an initial population vector whose components follow varying distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random discrepancy under weighted importance sampling of a class of stratified input. We give the expected $L_p-$discrepancy($2\leq p&lt;\infty$) upper bound in weighted form under a class of stratified sampling. This result contributes to the error estimate of the upper bound of the integral approximation under weighted importance sampling, and and our sampling pattern is a stratified input.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for subgraph counts in age-dependent random connection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study normal approximation of subgraph counts in a model of spatial scale-free random networks known as the age-dependent random connection model. In the light-tailed regime where only moments of order $(2 + \varepsilon)$ are finite, we study the asymptotic normality of both clique and subtree counts. For clique counts, we establish a multivariate quantitative normal approximation result through the Malliavin-Stein method. In the more delicate case of subtree counts, we obtain distributional convergence based on a central limit theorem for sequences of associated random variables.</description>

      <title>Structured coalescents, coagulation equations and multi-type branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the genealogy of a structured population consisting of $d$ colonies. Individuals migrate between colonies at a rate that scales with a positive parameter $K$. Within a colony, pairs of ancestral lineages coalesce at a constant rate, i.e. as in Kingman coalescent. We start this multi-type coalescent with $N_{K}$ single lineages distributed among the $d$ colonies. We consider two regimes: the critical sampling regime (case $N_{K} \sim K$) and the large sampling regime (case $N_{K} \gg K$). In this setting, we study the asymptotic behaviour, as $K\to\infty$, of the vector of empirical measures, whose $i$-th component keeps track at each time of the blocks present at colony $i$, and of the initial location of the lineages composing each blocks. We show that, in the proper time-space scaling (small times), the process of empirical measures converges to the solution of a $d$-dimensional coagulation equation. In the critical sampling regime, its solution admits a stochastic representation in terms of a multi-type branching process, and in the large sampling regime in terms of the entrance law of a multi-type Feller diffusion.</description>

      <title>Exceptional force, uncountably many solutions in the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of all eternal solutions $b(x,t)$ of the KPZ fixed point satisfying the asymptotic slope condition $\lim_{|x| \to \infty} \frac{b(x,0)}{x} = 2\xi$. For fixed $\xi$, there is exactly one eternal solution with probability one. However, in the second and third authors' work with Sepp\"al\"ainen, it was shown that there exists a random, countably infinite set of slopes, for which there exist at least two eternal solutions. These correspond to two non-coalescing families of infinite geodesics in the same direction for the directed landscape. We denote the two eternal solutions as $b^{\xi-}$ and $b^{\xi +}$. In the present paper, we show that, for the exceptional slopes, there are in fact uncountably many eternal solutions. To give the characterization, we show that these eternal solutions are in bijection with a certain set of bi-infinite competition interfaces. Each bi-infinite interface separates the plane into two connected components--a left component and a right component. A general eternal solution with slope $\xi$ is equal to $b^{\xi-}$ on the left component and equal to $b^{\xi +}$ on the right component. For these bi-infinite interfaces in the exceptional directions, we uncover new geometric phenomena that is not present for directed landscape geodesics.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>Gatheral double stochastic volatility model with Skorokhod reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Gatheral model of double mean-reverting stochastic volatility, in which the drift term itself follows a mean-reverting process, and the overall model exhibits mean-reverting behavior. We demonstrate that such processes can attain values arbitrarily close to zero and remain near zero for extended periods, making them practically and statistically indistinguishable from zero. To address this issue, we propose a modified model incorporating Skorokhod reflection, which preserves the model's flexibility while preventing volatility from approaching zero.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Domain Adaptation for Rotated Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has proven effective for domain adaptation (DA) by aligning distributions across domains with differing statistical properties. Building on the approach of Courty et al. (2016), who mapped source data to the target domain for improved model transfer, we focus on a supervised DA problem involving linear regression models under rotational shifts. This ongoing work considers cases where source and target domains are related by a rotation-common in applications like sensor calibration or image orientation. We show that in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , when using a p-norm cost with $p $\ge$ 2$, the optimal transport map recovers the underlying rotation. Based on this, we propose an algorithm that combines K-means clustering, OT, and singular value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the rotation angle and adapt the regression model. This method is particularly effective when the target domain is sparsely sampled, leveraging abundant source data for improved generalization. Our contributions offer both theoretical and practical insights into OT-based model adaptation under geometric transformations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control for Systems with Drifts of Bounded Variation: A Maximum Principle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of stochastic optimal control for systems governed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with drift coefficients of bounded variation. We establish both necessary and sufficient stochastic maximum principle. To achieve this, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to SDEs with random drifts of bounded variation. We then show that these solutions are Sobolev differentiable with respect to their initial conditions and provide an explicit representation involving integrals with respect to the local time of the state process. We handle the irregular drift, by constructing a sequence of approximating control problems with smooth coefficients. By applying Ekeland's variational principle, we obtain a sequence of adjoint processes, which we then use to derive the maximum principle by taking the limit.</description>

      <title>The Hutchinson-Barnsley theory for iterated function systems with general measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present iterated function systems with general measures(IFSm) formed by a set of maps $\tau_{\lambda}$ acting over a compact space $X$, for a compact space of indices, $\Lambda$. The Markov process $Z_k$ associated to the IFS iteration is defined using a general family of probabilities measures $q_x$ on $\Lambda$, where $x \in X$: $Z_{k+1}$ is given by $\tau_{\lambda}(Z_k)$, with $\lambda$ randomly chosen according to $q_x$. We prove the existence of the topological attractor and the existence of the invariant attracting measure for the Markov Process. We also prove that the support of the invariant measure is given by the attractor and results on the stochastic stability of the invariant measures, with respect to changes in the family $q_x$.</description>

      <title>Limit Profiles for Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.13437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Teyssier [Tey20] introduced a new method for approximating the distance from equilibrium of a random walk on a group. He used it to study the limit profile for the random transpositions card shuffle. His techniques were restricted to conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups; we derive similar approximation lemmas for random walks on homogeneous spaces and for general reversible Markov chains. We illustrate applications of these lemmas to some famous problems: the $k$-cycle shuffle, improving results of Hough [Hou16] and Berestycki, Schramm and Zeitouni [BSZ11]; the Ehrenfest urn diffusion with many urns, improving results of Ceccherini-Silberstein, Scarabotti and Tolli [CST07]; a Gibbs sampler, which is a fundamental tool in statistical physics, with Binomial prior and hypergeometric posterior, improving results of Diaconis, Khare and Saloff-Coste [DKS08].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.20029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a random commuting $d$-tuple of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to be a random variable that takes values in the set of commuting $d$-tuples and has a distribution that is a rapidly decaying continuous weight on this algebraic set. In the Hermitian case, we characterize the eigenvalue distribution as $n$ tends to infinity. In the non-Hermitian case, we get a formula that holds if the set is irreducible. We show that there are qualitative differences between the single matrix case and the several commuting matrices case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the characteristic polynomial for the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complex Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble, a family of random matrix models introduced by Girko that interpolates between the Ginibre Ensemble and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and such that its empirical spectral measure converges to the uniform measure on an ellipse. We show the convergence in law of its normalised characteristic polynomial outside of this ellipse. Our proof contains two main steps. We first show the tightness of the normalised characteristic polynomial using the link between the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and Hermite polynomials. This part relies on the uniform control of the Hermite kernel which is derived from the recent work of Akemann, Duits and Molag. In the second step, we identify the limiting object as the exponential of a Gaussian analytic function. The limit expression is derived from the convergence of traces of Chebyshev polynomials of random matrices by the method of moments. These traces of Chebyshev polynomials appear naturally as a kind of centered version, or normal ordering, of the traces of the monomials. This work answers the interpolation problem raised in the work of Bordenave, Chafa{\"i} and the second author of this paper for the integrable case of the Elliptic Ginibre Ensemble and is therefore a fist step towards the conjectured universality of this result.</description>

      <title>Stationary entrance chains and applications to random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Markov chain $Y$ with values in a Polish space, consider the entrance chain, obtained by sampling $Y$ at the moments when it enters a fixed set $A$ from its complement $A^c$. Similarly, consider the exit chain, obtained by sampling $Y$ at the exit times from $A^c$ to $A$. We use the method of inducing from ergodic theory to study invariant measures of these two types of Markov chains in the case when the initial chain $Y$ has a known invariant measure. We give explicit formulas for invariant measures of the entrance and exit chains under certain recurrence-type assumptions on $A$ and $A^c$, which apply even for transient chains. Then we study uniqueness and ergodicity of these invariant measures assuming that $Y$ is topologically recurrent, topologically irreducible, and weak Feller.
  We give applications to random walks in $R^d$, which we regard as ``stationary'' Markov chains started under the Lebesgue measure. We are mostly interested in dimension one, where we study the Markov chain of overshoots above the zero level of a random walk that oscillates between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. We show that this chain is ergodic, and use this result to prove a central limit theorem for the number of level crossings of a random walk with zero mean and finite variance of increments.</description>

      <title>Dissipative particle systems on expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and critical behavior in hierarchical integer-valued Gaussian and Coulomb gas models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a square box $\Lambda_n\subseteq\mathbb Z^2$ of side length $L^n$ with $L,n&gt;1$, we study hierarchical random fields $\{\phi_x\colon x\in\Lambda_n\}$ with law proportional to ${\rm e}^{\frac12\beta(\phi,\Delta_n\phi)}\prod_{x\in\Lambda_n}\nu({\rm d}\phi_x)$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta_n$ is a hierarchical Laplacian on $\Lambda_n$, and $\nu$ is a non-degenerate $1$-periodic measure on $\mathbb R$. Our setting includes the integer-valued Gaussian field (a.k.a. DG model or Villain Coulomb gas) and the sine-Gordon model. Relying on renormalization group analysis we derive sharp asymptotic formulas, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, for the covariance $\langle\phi_x\phi_y\rangle$ and the fractional charge $\langle {\rm e}^{2\pi {\rm i}\alpha(\phi_x-\phi_y)}\rangle$ in the subcritical $\beta&lt;\beta_{\rm c}:=\pi^2/\log L$, critical $\beta=\beta_{\rm c}$ and slightly supercritical $\beta&gt;\beta_{\rm c}$ regimes. The field exhibits logarithmic correlations throughout albeit with a distinct $\beta$-dependence of both the covariance scale and the fractional-charge exponents in the sub/supercritical regimes. Explicit logarithmic corrections appear at the critical point.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Sample-Path Large Deviations for Functionals of Poisson Cluster Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sample-path large deviation principles for the centered cumulative functional of marked Poisson cluster processes in the Skorokhod space equipped with the M1 topology, under joint regular variation assumptions on the marks and the offspring distributions governing the propagation mechanism. These findings can also be interpreted as hidden regular variation of the cluster processes' functionals, extending the results in Dombry et al. (2022) to cluster processes with heavy-tailed characteristics, including mixed Binomial Poisson cluster processes and Hawkes processes. Notably, by restricting to the adequate subspace of measures on D([0, 1], R+), and applying the correct normalization and scaling to the paths of the centered cumulative functional, the limit measure concentrates on paths with multiple large jumps.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations and the Peano Phenomenon in Stochastic Differential Equations with Homogeneous Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with drift equal to the gradient of a homogeneous potential of degree $1+\gamma$, with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$, and local variance equal to $\varepsilon^2$ with $\varepsilon\to 0$. The associated deterministic system for $\varepsilon=0$ has a potential that is not a Lipschitz function at the origin. Therefore, an infinite number of solutions exist, known as the Peano phenomenon. In this work, we study large deviations of first and second order for the system with noise, generalizing previous results for the particular potential $b(x)=x |x|^{\gamma-1}$. For the first-order large deviations, we recover the rate function from the well-known Freidlin-Wentzell work. For the second-order large deviation, we use a refinement of Carmona-Simon bounds for the eigenfunctions of a Schr\"odinger operator and prove that the exponential behavior of the process depends only on the ground state of such an operator. Moreover, a refined study of the ground state allows us to obtain the large deviation rate function explicitly and to deduce that the family of diffusions converges to the set of extreme solutions of the deterministic system.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the jump-size distribution for an M/G/1 storage system with Poisson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a non-parametric estimator for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the jump-size distribution for a storage system with compound Poisson input. The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\frac{\eta}{1+\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\eta&gt;0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions. A heuristic method is further developed to address the case of an unknown rate of the compound Poisson input process.</description>

      <title>Verification theorem related to a zero sum stochastic differential game, based on a chain rule for non-smooth functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a verification theorem, inspired by those existing in stochastic control, to demonstrate how a pair of feedback controls can form a Nash equilibrium in a stochastic zero-sum differential game. Suppose for instance that the diffusion coefficient of the state equation is non-degenerate and the classical Isaacs condition is satisfied and the existence of a (what is termed) quasi-strong solution to the Bellman-Isaacs (BI) equations. In that case we are able to show that there exists a saddle point constituted by a couple of feedback controls that achieve the value of the game. Moreover, the latter is equal to the unique solution of the BI equations. A suitable generalization is available when diffusion is possibly degenerate. Similarly we have also improved a well-known verification theorem in stochastic control theory. The techniques of stochastic calculus via regularizations we use, in particular specific chain rules, are borrowed from a companion paper of the authors.</description>

      <title>Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism and (1) the length and the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle.
  Together with the isoperimetric inequality and the monotonicity of the Loewner energy, our identities immediately imply two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms. Moreover, we extend the identity (1) to the dual Epstein curve in de Sitter $2$-space, to the Schwarzian action for the coadjoint orbits $\mathrm{M\"{o}b}_n (\mathbb{S}^1) \backslash \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)$, and to piecewise M\"obius circle diffeomorphisms which are only $C^{1,1}$ regular.
  We also show that the horocycle truncation used in the construction of the Epstein curve defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <title>The Problem of the Priors, or Posteriors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of the priors is well known: it concerns the challenge of identifying norms that govern one's prior credences. I argue that a key to addressing this problem lies in considering what I call the problem of the posteriors -- the challenge of identifying norms that directly govern one's posterior credences, which backward induce some norms on the priors via the diachronic requirement of conditionalization. This forward-looking approach can be summarized as: Think ahead, work backward. Although this idea can be traced to Freedman (1963), Carnap (1963), and Shimony (1970), I believe that it has not received enough attention. In this paper, I initiate a systematic defense of forward-looking Bayesianism, addressing potential objections from more traditional views (both subjectivist and objectivist). I also develop a specific approach to forward-looking Bayesianism -- one that values the convergence of posterior credences to the truth, and treats it as a fundamental rather than derived norm. This approach, called {\em convergentist Bayesianism}, is argued to be crucial for a Bayesian foundation of Ockham's razor in statistics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Accelerated escape dynamics in non-Markovian stochastic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}(\ell,n) \subset S_n^{\ell}$ denote the set of all $\ell$-tuples $(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$, for $\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \in S_n$ satisfying: $\forall i&lt;j$ we have $\pi_i\pi_j=\pi_j\pi_i$. Considering the action of $S_n$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $\kappa(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell})$ be equal to the number of orbits of the action of the subgroup $\langle \pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell} \rangle \subset S_n$. There has been interest in the study of the combinatorial numbers $A(\ell,n,k)$ equal to the cardinalities $|\{(\pi_1,\dots,\pi_{\ell}) \in \mathcal{A}(\ell,n)\, :\, \kappa(\pi_1,\dots\pi_{\ell})=k\}|$. If one defines $B(\ell,n)=A(\ell,n,1)/(n-1)!$, then it is known that $B(\ell,n) = \sum_{(f_1,\dots,f_{\ell}) \in \mathbb{N}^{\ell}} \mathbf{1}_{\{n\}}(f_1\cdots f_{\ell}) \prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1} f_r^{\ell-r}$. A special case, $\ell=2$, is $B(2,n) = \sum_{d|n} d = \sigma_1(n)$ the sum-of-divisors function. Then $A(2,n,1)/n!=B(2,n)/n$ is called the abundancy index: $\sigma_1(n)/n$. We call $B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ the ``generalized abundancy index.'' Building on work of Abdesselam, using the probability model, we prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ equals $\zeta(2)\cdots \zeta(\ell)$. Motivated by this we state a more precise conjecture for the asymptotics of $-\zeta(2) + N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} (B(2,n)/n)$.</description>

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are powerful mathematical models that integrate the biological details of neural systems, but their complexity often makes them computationally expensive and analytically untractable. The firing rate of an SNN is a crucial first-order statistic to characterize network activity. However, estimating firing rates analytically from even simplified SNN models is challenging due to 1) the intricate dependence between the nonlinear network dynamics and parameters, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. In this Letter, we propose a class of computationally efficient, simulation-free estimators of firing rates. This is based on a hierarchy of Markovian approximations that reduces the complexity of SNN dynamics. We show that while considering firing rates alone is insufficient for accurate estimations of themselves, the information of spiking synchrony dramatically improves the estimator's accuracy. This approach provides a practical tool for brain modelers, directly mapping biological parameters to firing rate.</description>
