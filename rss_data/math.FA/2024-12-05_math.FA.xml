      <title>Blow-up Behaviors of Ground States in Ergodic Mean-field Games Systems with Hartree-type Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concentration behaviors of ground states to stationary Mean-field Games systems (MFGs) with the nonlocal coupling in $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq 2.$ With the mass critical exponent imposed on Riesz potentials, we first discuss the existence of ground states to potential-free MFGs, which corresponds to the establishment of Gagliardo-Nirenberg type's inequality. Next, with the aid of the optimal inequality, we classify the existence of ground states to stationary MFGs with Hartree-type coupling in terms of the $L^1$-norm of population density defined by $M$. In addition, under certain types of coercive potentials, the asymptotics of ground states to ergodic MFGs with the nonlocal coupling are captured. Moreover, if the local polynomial expansions are imposed on potentials, we study the refined asymptotic behaviors of ground states and show that they concentrate on the flattest minima of potentials.</description>

      <title>Some lower bounds for optimal sampling recovery of functions with mixed smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of sampling recovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done by proving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear sampling recovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address the problem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.
  In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory of estimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower bounds for the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use the above approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, is based on some simple observations. We demonstrate how these observations can be used.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of subalgebras of bounded analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H^\infty$ denotes the algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the unit disk. It is well-known that every (algebra) automorphism of $H^\infty$ is a composition operator induced by disc automorphism. Maurya et al., (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 530 : Paper No: 127698, 2024) proved that every automorphism of the subalgebras $\{f\in H^\infty : f(0) = 0\}$ or $\{f\in H^\infty : f'(0) = 0\}$ is a composition operator induced by a rotation. In this article, we give very simple proof of their results. As an interesting generalization, for any $\psi\in H^\infty$, we show that every automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ must be a composition operator and characterize all such composition operators. Using this characterization, we find all automorphism of $\psi H^\infty$ for few choices of $\psi$ with various nature depending on its zeros.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of quasi-invariant states introduced in [2, 3] from an analytic viewpoint.We give the structures of quasi-invariant states with uniformly bounded cocycles. As a consequence, we can apply a Theorem of Kovacs and Szucs to get a conditional expectation on fixed points and another of Stormer to get an invariant semifinite trace under extra assumptions.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Weighted Tensorized Fractional Brownian Fields and associated function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of self-similar fractional Brownian fields, called Weighted Tensorized Fractional Brownian Fields (WTFBS). These fields, introduced in the companion paper \cite{ELLV}, generalize the well-known fractional Brownian sheet (FBs) by relaxing its tensor-product structure, resulting in new self-similar Gaussian fields with stationary rectangular increments that differ from the FBs. We analyze the local regularity properties of these fields and introduce a new concept of regularity through the definition of Weighted Tensorized Besov Spaces. These spaces combine aspects of mixed dominating smoothness spaces and hyperbolic Besov spaces, which are similar in structure to classical Besov spaces. We provide a detailed characterization of these spaces using Littlewood-Paley theory and hyperbolic wavelet analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for discrete uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the bulk transport coefficients of uniaxial polycrystalline materials, including electrical and thermal conductivity, diffusivity, complex permittivity, and magnetic permeability, have Stieltjes integral representations involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators. The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and resistivity $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}^*$ and $\boldsymbol{\rho}^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the various structures associated with maximally monotone and quasidense subsets of the product of a real Banach space and its dual. We give six statements equivalent to the assertion that a maximally monotone subset be quasidense. We define the Fitzpatrick extension to the dual of a quasidense maximally monotone set, and give seven equivalent characterizations of an element of this set. We also give an example of a quasidense maximally monotone set whose Fitzpatrick extension, which is always maximally monotone, is not quasidense. We generalize Rockafellar's surjectivity theorem for maximally monotone subsets of reflexive Banach spaces to quasidense maximally monotone subsets of general Banach spaces. We also discuss briefly maximally monotone subsets of ``type (NI)'', ``type (D)'' and ``type (WD)''.</description>

      <title>First-order Sobolev spaces, self-similar energies and energy measures on the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate $(1, p)$-Sobolev space, $p$-energy, and the corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet for all $p \in (1, \infty)$. Our method is based on the idea of Kusuoka and Zhou [Probab. Theory Related Fields $\textbf{93}$ (1992), no. 2, 169--196], where Brownian motion (the case $p = 2$) on self-similar sets including the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet were constructed. Similar to this earlier work, we use a sequence of discrete graph approximations and the corresponding discrete $p$-energies to define the Sobolev space and $p$-energies. However, we need a new approach to ensure that our $(1, p)$-Sobolev space has a dense set of continuous functions when $p$ is less than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. The new ingredients are the use of Loewner type estimates on combinatorial modulus to obtain Poincar\'e inequality and elliptic Harnack inequality on a sequence of approximating graphs. An important feature of our Sobolev space is the self-similarity of our $p$-energy, which allows us to define corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. We show that our Sobolev space can also be viewed as a Korevaar-Schoen type space. We apply our results to the attainment problem for Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. In particular, we show that if the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, say $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$, is attained, then any optimal measure which attains $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$ should be comparable with the $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$-energy measure of some function in our $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space up to a multiplicative constant. In this case, we also prove that the Newton-Sobolev space corresponding to any optimal measure and metric can be identified as our self-similar $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>
