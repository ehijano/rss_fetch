      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere equation, hyperk\"ahler structure and adapted complex structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the tangent bundle of $(M,g)$, it is well-known that the Monge-Amp\`ere equation $(\partial\bar\partial \sqrt\rho)^n=0$ has the asymptotic expansion $
\rho(x+iy)=\sum_{ij} g_{ij} (x) y_{i} y_{j} + O(y^4)$ near $M$. Those 4th order terms are made explicit in this article: $$\rho(x+iy)=\sum_{i}y_{i}^2-\frac 13\sum_{pqij} R_{i p j q}(0)x_p x_q y_{i}y_{j}+O(5).$$ At $M$, sectional curvatures of the K\"ahler metric $2i\partial\bar\partial\rho$ can be computed. This has enabled us to find a family of K\"ahler manifolds whose tangent bundles have admitted complete hyperk\"ahler structures whereas the adapted complex structure can only be partially defined on the tangent bundles.
  In these cases, the study of the adapted complex structure is equivalent to the study of some gauge transformations on the baby Nahm's equation $\dot T_1+[T_0,T_1]=0.$</description>

      <title>Norm-squared of the momentum map in infinite dimensions with applications to K\"ahler geometry and symplectic connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the norm-squared of the momentum map as a rigorous tool in infinite dimensions. In particular, we calculate the Hessian at a critical point, show that it is positive semi-definite along the complexified orbit, and determine a decomposition of the stabilizer under the complexified action. We apply these results to the action of the group of symplectomorphisms on the spaces of compatible almost complex structures and of symplectic connections. In the former case, we extend results of Calabi to not necessarily integrable almost complex structures that are extremal in a relative sense. In both cases, the momentum map is not equivariant, which gives rise to new phenomena and opens up new avenues for interesting applications. For example, using the prequantization construction, we obtain new central extensions of the group of symplectomorphisms that are encoding geometric information of the underlying finite-dimensional manifold.</description>

      <title>On Relative Tractor Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article contributes to the relative BGG-machinery for parabolic geometries. Starting from a relative tractor bundle, this machinery constructs a sequence of differential operators that are naturally associated to the geometry in question. In many situations of interest, it is known that this sequence provides a resolution of a sheaf that can locally be realized as a pullback from a local leaf space of a foliation that is naturally available in this situation. An explicit description of the latter sheaf was only available under much more restrictive assumptions.
  For any geometry which admits relative tractor bundles, we construct a large family of such bundles for which we obtain a simple, explicit description of the resolved sheaves under weak assumptions on the torsion of the geometry. In particular, we discuss the cases of Legendrean contact structures and of generalized path geometries, which are among the most important examples for which the relative BGG machinery is available. In both cases, we show that essentially all relative tractor bundles are obtained by our construction and our description of the resolved sheaves applies whenever the BGG sequence is a resolution.</description>

      <title>The manifold of polygons degenerated to segments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the space $\mathbb{L}(n)$ of $n$-gons in the plane degenerated to segments. We prove that this space is a smooth real submanifold of $\mathbb{C}^n$, and describe its topology in terms of the manifold $\mathbb{M}(n)$ of $n$-gons degenerated to segments and with the first vertex at 0. We show that $\mathbb{M}(n)$ and $\mathbb{L}(n)$ contain straight lines that form a basis of directions in each one of their tangent spaces, and we compute the geodesic equations in these manifolds. Finally, the quotient of $\mathbb{L}(n)$ by the diagonal action of the affine complex group and the re-enumeration of the vertices is described.</description>

      <title>Topological Spherical T-duality -- Dimension change from higher degree $H$-flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Spherical T-duality was introduced by Bouwknegt, Evslin and Mathai in [BEM15] as an extension of topological T-duality from $S^1$ bundles to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-bundles endowed with closed 7-forms. This notion was further extended to sphere bundles by Lind, Sati and Westerland [LSW16] as a duality between $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed $(4n-1)$-forms. We generalise this relation one step further and define T-duality for $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed odd forms of arbitrary degree. The degree of the form determines the dimension of the fibers of the dual spaces. We show that $T$-duals exist and, as in the previous cases, $T$-dual spaces have isomorphic twisted cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain several classification results of $2$-dimensional complete Lagrangian translators and lagrangian self-expanders with constant squared norm $|\vec{H}|^{2}$ of the mean curvature vector in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ by using a new Omori-Yau type maximum principle which was proved by Chen and Qiu \cite{CQ}. The same idea is also used to give a similar result of Lagrangian $\xi$-translators in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Ricci--Bourguignon Almost Solitons with Special Potential on Sasaki-like Almost Contact Complex Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost contact complex Riemannian manifolds, also known as almost contact B-metric manifolds, are equipped with a pair of pseudo-Riemannian metrics that are mutually associated with each other using the tensor structure. Here we consider a special class of these manifolds, those of the Sasaki-like type. They have an interesting geometric interpretation: the complex cone of such a manifold is a holomorphic complex Riemannian manifold (also called a K\"ahler-Norden manifold). The basic metric on the considered manifold is specialized here as a soliton, i.e. has an additional curvature property such that the metric is a self-similar solution of an intrinsic geometric flow. Almost solitons are more general objects than solitons because they use functions rather than constants as coefficients in the defining condition. A $\beta$-Ricci-Bourguignon-like almost soliton ($\beta$ is a real constant) is defined using the pair of metrics. The introduced soliton is a generalization of some well-known (almost) solitons (such as those of Ricci, Schouten, and Einstein), which in principle arise from a single metric rather than a pair of metrics. The soliton potential is chosen to be pointwise collinear to the Reeb vector field, or the Lie derivative of any B-metric along the potential to be the same metric multiplied by a function. The resulting manifolds equipped with the introduced almost solitons are characterized geometrically. Appropriate examples for two types of almost solitons are constructed and the properties obtained in the theoretical part are confirmed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to prove that if $Y$ is a compact manifold, if $Z$ is an Anosov vector field on $Y$, and if $F$ is a flat vector bundle, then there is a corresponding canonical nonzero section $\tau_{\nu}\left(i_{Z}\right)$ of the determinant line $\nu=\mathrm{det} H\left(Y,F\right)$. In families, this section is $C^{1}$. When $F$ is flat on the total space of the corresponding fibration, our section is flat with respect to the Gauss-Manin connection on $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Proper affine deformations of positive representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define for every positive Anosov representation of a nonabelian free group into $\mathrm{SO}(2n,2n-1)$ a family of $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$-valued cocycles which induce proper affine actions on $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$. We construct fundamental domains in $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$ bounded by generalized crooked planes for these affine actions, and deduce that the quotient manifolds are homeomorphic to handlebodies.</description>

      <title>Uniform diameter estimates for Kaehler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a uniform diameter estimate and a uniform local non-collapsing of volumes for a large family of Kaehler metrics generalizing those obtained recently by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm to the extent that no assumption on the uniform (pointwise) non-vanishing of volume forms is required. We treat also similar questions in the singular setting where the cohomology classes are allowed to degenerate to non-big classes. This again extends results by the latter authors where only the non-collapsing case was considered.</description>

      <title>Einstein manifolds with optical geometries of Kerr type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the Ricci flat Lorentzian $n$-manifolds satisfying three particular conditions, encoding and combining some crucial features of the Kerr metrics and the Robinson-Trautman optical structures. We prove that if $n &gt; 4$, there is no Lorentzian manifold satisfying the considered conditions, while for $n = 4$ there are two large classes of such manifolds. Each class consists of manifolds fibering over open Riemann surfaces, equipped with a metric of constant Gaussian curvature $\kappa = 1$ or $\kappa = -1$. The first class properly includes a three parameter family of metrics admitting real analytic extensions to $(\mathbb R^3 \setminus\{0\}) \times \mathbb R = (S^2 \times \mathbb R_+) \times \mathbb R$ (all others develop singularities) and all such extensions are isometric to the well-known Kerr metrics. The three parameters correspond to the three space-like components of the angular momentum of the gravitational field. The second class contains a subclass of metrics defined on $\big(\mathbb D\times \mathbb R_+\big)\times \mathbb R$, where $\mathbb D$ is the Lobachevsky Poincar\'e disc. This subclass is in bijection with the holomorphic functions on $\mathbb D$ satisfying an appropriate open condition. These and other results are obtained as consequences of a very simple method of generating a number of explicit examples of Ricci flat Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish in the present paper two sub-gradient estimates for the quaternionic contact (qc) heat equation on a compact qc manifold of dimension $4n+3$, provided some positivity conditions are satisfied. These are qc versions of the prominent Li-Yau gradient estimate in Riemannian geometry. Another goal of this paper is to get two Perelman-type entropy formulas for the qc heat equation on a compact qc-Einstein manifold of dimension $4n+3$ with non-negative qc scalar curvature (e.g. compact $3$-Sasakian manifold), as well as an integral sub-gradient estimate for the positive solutions of the qc heat equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider active nematodynamics on deformable surfaces. Based on a thermodynamically consistent surface Beris-Edwards model we add nematic activity and focus on the emerging additional coupling mechanism between the nematic field, the flow field and the curved surface. We analyse the impact of the active nematic force at topological defects. Under the presence of curvature all defects become active and contribute not only tangential forces but also normal forces. This confirms the proposed role of topological defects in surface evolution and provides the basis for a dynamic description of morphogenetic processes.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove that entire critical points $(u,\nabla)$ of the self-dual $U(1)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs functional $E_1$, with energy
  $$E_1(u,\nabla;B_R):=\int_{B_R}\left[|\nabla u|^2+\frac{(1-|u|^2)^2}{4}+|F_\nabla|^2\right]\leq(2\pi+\tau(n)) \omega_{n-2}R^{n-2}$$
  for all $R&gt;0$, have unique blow-down. Moreover, we show that they are two-dimensional in ambient dimension $2\leq n\leq4$, or in any dimension $n\ge2$ assuming that $(u,\nabla)$ is a local minimizer, thus establishing a co-dimension-two analogue of Savin's theorem. The main ingredient is an Allard-type improvement of flatness.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V.\;Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat principal bundles with dense holonomy group if the base space has Anosov geodesic flow (e.g. in negative sectional curvature).
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.03746v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth foliation on a closed manifold, basic forms are differential forms that can be expressed locally in terms of the transverse variables. The space of basic forms yields a differential complex, because the exterior derivative fixes this set. The basic cohomology is the cohomology of this complex, and this has been studied extensively. Given a Riemannian metric, the adjoint of the exterior derivative maps the orthogonal complement of the basic forms to itself, and we call the resulting cohomology the "antibasic cohomology". Although these groups are defined using the metric, the dimensions of the antibasic cohomology groups are invariant under diffeomorphism and metric changes. If the underlying foliation is Riemannian, the groups are foliated homotopy invariants that are independent of basic cohomology and ordinary cohomology of the manifold. For this class of foliations we use the codifferential on antibasic forms to obtain the corresponding Laplace operator, develop its analytic properties, and prove a Hodge theorem. We then find some topological and geometric properties that impose restrictions on the antibasic Betti numbers.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09127v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index formula, we construct an obstruction to positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries on spin manifolds of infinite K-area. We also characterize the extremal case. Next we show a general deformation principle for boundary conditions of metrics with lower scalar curvature bounds. This implies that the relaxation of boundary conditions often induces weak homotopy equivalences of spaces of such metrics. This can be used to refine the smoothing of codimension-one singularites a la Miao and the deformation of boundary conditions a la Brendle-Marques-Neves, among others. Finally, we construct compact manifolds for which the spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries have nontrivial higher homotopy groups.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics as $s \to 0^+$ of the fractional perimeter on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11590v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the asymptotics of the fractional Laplacian as $s\to 0^+$ on any complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, both of finite and infinite volume. Surprisingly enough, when $M$ is not stochastically complete this asymptotics is related to the existence of bounded harmonic functions on $M$.
  As a corollary, we can find the asymptotics of the fractional $s$-perimeter on (essentially) every complete manifold, generalising both the existing results for $\mathbb{R}^n$ and for the Gaussian space. In doing so, from many sets $E\subset M$ we are able to produce a bounded harmonic function associated to $E$, which in general can be non-constant.</description>

      <title>Critical points of the distance function to a generic submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, the critical points of the distance function $d_{\mathsf{M}}$ to a compact submanifold $\mathsf{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ can be poorly behaved. In this article, we show that this is generically not the case by listing regularity conditions on the critical and $\mu$-critical points of a submanifold and by proving that they are generically satisfied and stable with respect to small $C^2$ perturbations. More specifically, for any compact abstract manifold $M$, the set of embeddings $i:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^D$ such that the submanifold $i(M)$ satisfies those conditions is open and dense in the Whitney $C^2$-topology. When those regularity conditions are fulfilled, we prove that the distance function to $i(M)$ satisfies Morse-like conditions and that the critical points of the distance function to an $\varepsilon$-dense subset of the submanifold (e.g., obtained via some sampling process) are well-behaved. We also provide many examples that showcase how the absence of these conditions allows for pathological situations.</description>

      <title>A family of K\"ahler flying wing steady Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $1996$, H.-D. Cao constructed a $U(n)$-invariant steady gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and asked whether every steady gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton of positive curvature on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ is necessarily $U(n)$-invariant (and hence unique up to scaling). Recently, Apostolov-Cifarelli answered this question in the negative for $n=2$. Here, we construct a family of $U(1)\times U(n-1)$-invariant, but not $U(n)$-invariant, complete steady gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons with strictly positive curvature operator on real $(1,\,1)$-forms (in particular, with strictly positive sectional curvature) on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ for $n\geq3$, thereby answering Cao's question in the negative for $n\geq3$. This family of steady Ricci solitons interpolates between Cao's $U(n)$-invariant steady K\"ahler-Ricci soliton and the product of the cigar soliton and Cao's $U(n-1)$-invariant steady K\"ahler-Ricci soliton. This provides the K\"ahler analog of the Riemannian flying wings construction of Lai. In the process of the proof, we also demonstrate that the almost diameter rigidity of $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ endowed with the Fubini-Study metric does not hold even if the curvature operator is bounded below by $2$ on real $(1,\,1)$-forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there are no complete noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with the mean curvature $H&gt;1$ and finite index satisfying universal subexponential end growth in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$. A more general nonexistence result can be proved in a $4$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with certain curvature conditions. We also show that $4$-manifold with $\operatorname{Ric}&gt;1$ does not contain any complete noncompact stable minimal hypersurface with universal subexponential end growth. The proof relies on the harmonic function theory developed by Li-Tam-Wang and the $\mu$-bubble initially introduced by Gromov and further developed by Chodosh-Li-Stryker in the context of stable minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and nonexistence of CMC hypersurfaces in 5-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the nonnegative $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature and uniformly positive $k$-triRic curvature implies rigidity of complete noncompact two-sided stable minimal hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold $(X^5,g)$ with bounded geometry. The nonnegativity of $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature can be replaced by nonnegative Ricci and biRic curvature. In particular, there is no complete noncompact finite index CMC hypersurface in a closed $5$-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature. It extends result of Chodosh-Li-Stryker [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc (2024)] to $5$-dimensions. We also prove that complete constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^5$ with finite index and the mean curvature greater than $\frac{\sqrt{65}}{8}$ must be compact. This improves the previous larger bound $\frac{\sqrt{175}}{\sqrt{148}}$ on the mean curvature.</description>

Abstract: We study rigidity properties of actions of a torsion-free lattice of $\operatorname{PSU}(1,1)$ on the circle $S^1$. We follow the approaches of Frankel and Thurston proposed in preprints via foliated harmonic measures on the suspension bundles. Our main results are a curvature estimate and a Gauss--Bonnet formula for the $S^1$ connection obtained by taking the average of the flat connection with respect to a harmonic measure. As consequences, we give a precise description of the harmonic measure on suspension foliations with maximal Euler number and an alternative proof of rigidity theorems of Matsumoto and Burger--Iozzi--Wienhard.</description>

      <title>Estimates of K\"ahler metrics on noncompact finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, and their symmetric products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ denote a noncompact finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface of genus $g\geq 2$, with only one puncture at $i\infty$ (identifying $X$ with its universal cover $\mathbb{H}$). Let $\overline{X}:=X\cup\lbrace i\infty\rbrace$ denote the Satake compactification of $X$. Let $\Omega_{\overline{X}}$ denote the cotangent bundle on $\overline{X}$. For $k\gg1$, we derive an estimate for $\mu_{\overline{X}}^{\mathrm{Ber},k}$, the Bergman metric associated to the line bundle $\mathcal{L}^{k}:=\Omega_{\overline{X}}\otimes \mathcal{O}_{\overline{X}}\big((k-1)\infty\big)$.
  For a given $d\geq 1$, the pull-back of the Fubini-Study metric on the Grassmannian, which we denote by $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$, defines a K\"ahler metric on $\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})$, the $d$-fold symmetric product of $\overline{X}$. Using our estimates of $\mu_{\overline{X}}^{\mathrm{Ber},k}$, as an application, we derive an estimate for $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X}),\mathrm{vol}}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$, the volume form associated to the (1,1)-form $\mu_{\mathrm{Sym}^d(\overline{X})}^{\mathrm{FS},k}$.</description>

Abstract: This article presents an alternate way to prove a result originally proven by Harvey, Kawamuro, and Plamenvskaya in \cite{HaKaPl}. We accomplish this by explicitly constructing an overtwisted disk in the $p$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^3$ with the standard contact structure branched along a carefully selected transverse knot. Furthermore, by utilizing this construction of the overtwisted disk, we can see that the overtwisted disk is contained in the complement of the branch locus.</description>
