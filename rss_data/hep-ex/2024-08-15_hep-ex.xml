      <title>Measurement of the Drell--Yan forward-backward asymmetry and of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forward-backward asymmetry in Drell-Yan production and the effective leptonic electroweak mixing angle are measured in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement uses both dimuon and dielectron events, and is performed as a function of the dilepton mass and rapidity. The unfolded angular coefficient $A_4$ is also extracted, as a function of the dilepton mass and rapidity. Using the CT18Z set of parton distribution functions, we obtain $\sin\theta^\ell_\text{eff}$ = 0.23157 $\pm$ 0.00031, where the uncertainty includes the experimental and theoretical contributions. The measured value agrees with the standard model fit result to global experimental data. This is the most precise $\sin\theta^\ell_\text{eff}$ measurement at a hadron collider, with a precision comparable to the results obtained at LEP and SLD.</description>

      <title>Exploring New Physics with PandaX-4T Low Energy Electronic Recoil Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, such as axions, can be effectively searched through their interactions with electrons. We use the large liquid xenon detector PandaX-4T to search for novel electronic recoil signals induced by solar axions, neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moment, axion-like particles, dark photons, and light fermionic dark matter. A detailed background model is established with the latest datasets with 1.54 $\rm tonne \cdot year$ exposure. No significant excess above the background has been observed, and we have obtained competitive constraints for axion couplings, neutrino magnetic moment, and fermionic dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Search for baryon junctions in e+A collisions at the Electron Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>Dihadron azimuthal asymmetry and light-quark dipole moments at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe light-quark dipole moments by examining the azimuthal asymmetries between a collinear pair of hadrons in semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering off an unpolarized proton target at the Electron-Ion Collider. These asymmetries provide a means to observe transversely polarized quarks, which arise exclusively from the interference between the dipole and the Standard Model interactions, thereby depending linearly on the dipole couplings. We demonstrate that this novel approach can enhance current constraints on light-quark dipole operators by an order of magnitude, free from contamination of other new physics effects. Furthermore, it allows for a simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts of the dipole couplings, offering a new avenue for investigating potential $CP$-violating effects at high energies.</description>

      <title>Performance study of a bakelite RPC prototype built by new technique of linseed oil coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is one of the most commonly used detectors in high energy physics experiments for triggering and tracking because of its good efficiency ($\textgreater$~90\%) and time resolution ($\sim$~1-2~ns). Generally, the bakelite which is one of the most commonly used materials used as electrode plates in RPC, sometimes suffer from surface roughness issues. If the surface is not smooth, the micro discharge probability and spurious pulses increase, which leads to the deterioration in the performance of the detector. We have developed a new method of linseed oil coating for the bakelite based detectors to avoid the surface roughness issue. The detector is characterised with Tetrafluoroethane based gas mixture. The detector is also tested with a high rate of gamma radiation environment in the lab for the radiation hardness test. The detailed measurement procedure and test results are presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Emergence of New Systematics for Open Charm Production in High Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the production systematics of open charm hadron yields in high-energy collisions and their description based on the Statistical Hadronization Model. The rapidity density of $D^0, D^+, D^{*+}, D_s^+$ mesons and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons in heavy ion and proton-proton collisions is analyzed for different collision energies and centralities. The Statistical Hadronization Model is extended to open charm production in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions. In this context, we use the link established in [1], see also the further development in [2], between the rapidity density of open charm hadron yields, $dN_i/dy$, and the rapidity density of charm-anticharm quark pairs, $dN_{c\bar c}/d\eta$ to demonstrate that, in pp, pA and AA collisions, $dN_i/dy$ scales in leading order with $dN_{c\bar c}/d\eta$ and the slope coefficient is quantified by the appropriate thermal density ratio calculated at the chiral crossover temperature, $T_c=156.5$ MeV. It is also shown that, in high energy collisions and within uncertainties, $dN_i/dy$ exhibits the power-law scaling with the charged-particle pseudo-rapidity density. Furthermore, presently available data on different ratios of open charm rapidity densities in high-energy collisions are independent of collision energy and system size, as expected in the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

      <title>Defect recombination origin of low energy excess in semiconductor detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the detection threshold in semiconductor detectors is pushed to increasingly low energies, an ``excess" signal of apparent energy release events below a few hundred eV is observed in several different kinds of detectors, hindering their sensitivity for rare event signals in this energy range. Using atomistic simulations with classical thermostat and quantum thermal bath, we show that this kind of signal is consistent with energy release from long-term recombination events of complex defects that can be formed by any kind of nuclear recoil radiation events. The recombination events are shown to have a very similar exponential dependence of energy as that observed in experiments. By detailed analysis of recombination events, we show that crossing a low energy barrier ($\lesssim$ 0.1 eV) can trigger larger energy releases in an avalanche-like effect. This explains why large energy release events can occur even down to cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Long-range near-side correlation in $e^+e^-$ Collisions at 183-209 GeV with ALEPH Archived Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurement of two-particle angular correlations for charged particles with LEP-II data is presented. The study is performed using archived hadronic $e^+e^-$ data collected by ALEPH at center-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV, above the $W^+W^-$ production threshold, which provide access to unprecedented charged-particle multiplicities and more complex color-string configurations if compared to previous measurements at LEP-I energies. An intriguing long-range near-side excess is observed in the correlation function measured with respect to the thrust axis in the highest multiplicity interval $N_{\mathrm{trk}}\geq 50$. Such a structure is not predicted by the Monte-Carlo simulation. The harmonic anisotropy coefficients $v_n$, which result from the Fourier expansion of the two-particle correlation functions, were also measured for the first time in $e^+e^-$ data, and compared to PYTHIA6 predictions and to the results obtained in proton-proton collisions. The results presented in the Letter provide novel experimental constraints on the formation of collective phenomena in point-like $e^+e^-$ collisions.</description>

      <title>Search for electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in final states with two $\tau$-leptons in $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three searches for the direct production of $\tau$-sleptons or charginos and neutralinos in final states with at least two hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons are presented. For chargino and neutralino production, decays via intermediate $\tau$-sleptons or $W$ and $h$ bosons are considered. The analysis uses a dataset of $pp$ collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139\,$fb$^{-1}$, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant deviation from the expected Standard Model background is observed and supersymmetric particle mass limits at 95% confidence level are obtained in simplified models. For direct production of $\tilde~{\chi}^+_1\tilde~{\chi}^-_1$, chargino masses are excluded up to 970 GeV, while $\tilde~{\chi}^{\pm}_1$ and $\tilde~{\chi}^0_2$ masses up to 1160 GeV (330 GeV) are excluded for $\tilde~{\chi}^{\pm}_1\tilde~{\chi}^0_2$/$\tilde~{\chi}^+_1\tilde~{\chi}^-_1$ production with subsequent decays via $\tau$-sleptons ($W$ and $h$ bosons). Masses of $\tau$-sleptons up to 500 GeV are excluded for mass degenerate $\tilde~{\tau}_{L,R}$ scenarios and up to 425 GeV for $\tilde~{\tau}_L$-only scenarios. Sensitivity to $\tilde~{\tau}_R$-only scenarios from the ATLAS experiment is presented here for the first time, with $\tilde~{\tau}_R$ masses excluded up to 350 GeV.</description>

      <title>Measurements of electroweak $W^{\pm}Z$ boson pair production in association with two jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>

Abstract: Measurements of integrated and differential cross-sections for electroweak $W^{\pm}Z$ production in association with two jets ($W^{\pm}Zjj$) in proton$-$proton collisions are presented. The data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider from $2015$ to $2018$ at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $140$ fb$^{-1}$. The $W^{\pm}Zjj$ candidate events are reconstructed using leptonic decay modes of the gauge bosons. Events containing three identified leptons, either electrons or muons, and two jets are selected. Processes involving pure electroweak $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production at Born level are separated from $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production involving a strong coupling. The measured integrated fiducial cross-section of electroweak $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production per lepton flavour is $\sigma_{WZjj\mathrm{-EW} \rightarrow \ell^{'} \nu \ell \ell jj} = 0.368 \; \pm 0.037 \,(\mathrm{stat.}) \; \pm 0.059 \,(\mathrm{syst.}) \; \pm 0.003 \,(\mathrm{lumi.}) \; \mathrm{fb}$, where $\ell$ and $\ell^{'}$ are either an electron or a muon. Respective cross-sections of electroweak and strong $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production are measured separately for events with exactly two jets or with more than two jets, and in three bins of the invariant mass of the two jets. The inclusive $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production cross-section, without separating electroweak and strong production, is also measured to be $\sigma_{WZjj \rightarrow \ell^{'} \nu \ell \ell jj} = 1.462 \; \pm 0.063 \,(\mathrm{stat.}) \; \pm 0.118 \,(\mathrm{syst.}) \; \pm 0.012 \,(\mathrm{lumi.}) \; \mathrm{fb}$, per lepton flavour. The inclusive $W^{\pm}Zjj$ production cross-section is measured differentially for several kinematic observables. Finally, the measurements are used to constrain anomalous quartic gauge couplings by extracting 95% confidence level intervals on dimension-$8$ operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first analysis using RADES-BabyIAXO cavities as detectors of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). In particular, we discuss two configurations for distinct frequency ranges of HFGWs: Cavity 1, mostly sensitive at a frequency range of 252.8 - 333.2 MHz, and Cavity 2, at 2.504 - 3.402 GHz, which is a scaled down version of Cavity 1. We find that Cavity 1 will reach sensitivity to strains of the HFGWs of order $h_1\sim 10^{-21}$, while Cavity 2 will reach $h_2\sim 10^{-20}$. These represent the best estimations of the RADES-BabyIAXO cavities as HFGWs detectors, showing how this set-up can produce groundbreaking results in axion physics and HFGWs simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the cosmic p+He energy spectrum from 50 GeV to 0.5 PeV with the DAMPE space mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00137v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the light component of the cosmic-ray spectrum have revealed unexpected features that motivate further and more precise measurements up to the highest energies. The Dark Matter Particle Explorer is a satellite-based cosmic-ray experiment that has been operational since December 2015, continuously collecting data on high-energy cosmic particles with very good statistics, energy resolution, and particle identification capabilities. In this work, the latest measurements of the energy spectrum of proton+helium in the energy range from 46 GeV to 464 TeV are presented. Among the most distinctive features of the spectrum, a spectral hardening at 600 GeV has been observed, along with a softening at 29 TeV measured with a 6.6{\sigma} significance. Moreover, the detector features and the analysis approach allowed for the extension of the spectral measurement up to the sub-PeV region. Even if with small statistical significance due to the low number of events, data suggest a new spectral hardening at about 150 TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum and rearrangement decays of S-wave $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states in a simplified quark model. The masses and widths are estimated by assuming that the $X(4140)$ is the lower $1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Comparing our results with experimental measurements, we find that the recently observed $X(3960)$ by LHCb can be assigned as the lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state and the $X_0(4140)$ could be the second lowest $0^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. Predictions of ratios between partial widths for the involved tetraquarks are given. We call for searches for more $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $0^{++}$, and $2^{++}$.</description>

      <title>SymbolNet: Neural Symbolic Regression with Adaptive Dynamic Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to genetic programming, the neural network approach to symbolic regression can efficiently handle high-dimensional inputs and leverage gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining expression complexity often involve multistage pruning with fine-tuning, which can result in significant performance loss. In this work, we propose $\tt{SymbolNet}$, a neural network approach to symbolic regression in a novel framework that allows dynamic pruning of model weights, input features, and mathematical operators in a single training process, where both training loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a sparsity regularization term for each pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its strength, leading to convergence at a target sparsity ratio. Unlike most existing symbolic regression methods that struggle with datasets containing more than $\mathcal{O}(10)$ inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN (3072 inputs). Our approach enables symbolic regression to achieve fast inference with nanosecond-scale latency on FPGAs for high-dimensional datasets in environments with stringent computational resource constraints, such as the high-energy physics experiments at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Charmonium states in a coupled-channel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the mass spectrum and two-body open-charm strong decays of charmonium states in a coupled-channel model where the $^3P_0$ quark-antiquark pair creation mechanism is employed. The results of masses, mass shifts, proportions of the $c\bar{c}$ component, and open-charm decay widths are provided. The $S$-$D$ wave mixing angles and di-electric decay widths for vector mesons are also presented. Based on our results, we find that the $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4360)$, and $\psi(4415)$ can be assigned as the $1^3D_1$-, $3^3S_1$-, $2^3D_1$-, $4^3S_1$-, and $3^3D_1$-dominated charmonium states, respectively. The $\psi_3(3842)$ is a good candidate of the $\psi_3(1D)$ charmonium state. The calculated mass and strong decay width of $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ with significant continuum contribution ($\sim$57\%) favor the charmonium interpretation for the mysterious $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. When considering the large uncertainty in the observed decay width, the possibility to assign the $\chi_{c0}(3860)$ as the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state cannot be ruled out. One may describe well the properties of $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ with the $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ charmonium. The predictions on properties of other $c\bar{c}$ states can be tested by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Global Optimisation of Black-Box Functions with Generative Models in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new uncertainty estimator for gradient-free optimisation of black-box simulators using deep generative surrogate models. Optimisation of these simulators is especially challenging for stochastic simulators and higher dimensions. To address these issues, we utilise a deep generative surrogate approach to model the black box response for the entire parameter space. We then leverage this knowledge to estimate the proposed uncertainty based on the Wasserstein distance - the Wasserstein uncertainty. This approach is employed in a posterior agnostic gradient-free optimisation algorithm that minimises regret over the entire parameter space. A series of tests were conducted to demonstrate that our method is more robust to the shape of both the black box function and the stochastic response of the black box than state-of-the-art methods, such as efficient global optimisation with a deep Gaussian process surrogate.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Cognitive Interaction Model of Instrument Operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel multi-agent, multi-scale computational cognitive interaction model of instrument operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). A leading scientific user facility, LCLS is the world's first hard x-ray free electron laser, operated by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. As the world's first x-ray free electron laser, LCLS is in high demand and heavily oversubscribed. Our overall project employs cognitive engineering methodologies to improve experimental efficiency and scientific productivity by refining experimental interfaces and workflows, simplifying tasks, reducing errors, and improving operator safety and stress levels. Our model simulates aspects of human cognition at multiple cognitive and temporal scales, ranging from seconds to hours, and among agents playing multiple roles, including instrument operator, real time data analyst, and experiment manager. The model can predict impacts stemming from proposed changes to operational interfaces and workflows. Because the model code is open source, and supplemental videos go into detail on all aspects of the model and results, this approach could be applied to other experimental apparatus and processes. Example results demonstrate the model's potential in guiding modifications to improve operational efficiency and scientific output. We discuss the implications of our findings for cognitive engineering in complex experimental settings and outline future directions for research.</description>
