      <title>Generative AI-enhanced Sector-based Investment Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&amp;P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).
  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.
  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Utility Maximisation with Model-independent Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an agent who has access to a financial market, including derivative contracts, who looks to maximise her utility. Whilst the agent looks to maximise utility over one probability measure, or class of probability measures, she must also ensure that the mark-to-market value of her portfolio remains above a given threshold. When the mark-to-market value is based on a more pessimistic valuation method, such as model-independent bounds, we recover a novel optimisation problem for the agent where the agents investment problem must satisfy a pathwise constraint.
  For complete markets, the expression of the optimal terminal wealth is given, using the max-plus decomposition for supermartingales. Moreover, for the Black-Scholes-Merton model the explicit form of the process involved in such decomposition is obtained, and we are able to investigate numerically optimal portfolios in the presence of options which are mispriced according to the agent's beliefs.</description>

      <title>Robust Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should financial institutions hedge their balance sheets against interest rate risk when managing long-term assets and liabilities? We address this question by proposing a bond portfolio solution based on ambiguity-averse preferences, which generalizes classical immunization and accommodates arbitrary liability structures, portfolio constraints, and interest rate perturbations. In a further extension, we show that the optimal portfolio can be computed as a simple generalized least squares problem, making the solution both transparent and computationally efficient. The resulting portfolio also reduces leverage by implicitly regularizing the portfolio weights, which enhances out-of-sample performance. Numerical evaluations using both empirical and simulated yield curves support the feasibility and accuracy of our approach relative to existing methods.</description>
