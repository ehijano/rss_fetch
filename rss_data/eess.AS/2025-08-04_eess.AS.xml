      <title>Melody-Lyrics Matching with Contrastive Alignment Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between music and lyrics is far beyond semantic bonds. Conceptual pairs in the two modalities such as rhythm and rhyme, note duration and syllabic stress, and structure correspondence, raise a compelling yet seldom-explored direction in the field of music information retrieval. In this paper, we present melody-lyrics matching (MLM), a new task which retrieves potential lyrics for a given symbolic melody from text sources. Rather than generating lyrics from scratch, MLM essentially exploits the relationships between melody and lyrics. We propose a self-supervised representation learning framework with contrastive alignment loss for melody and lyrics. This has the potential to leverage the abundance of existing songs with paired melody and lyrics. No alignment annotations are required. Additionally, we introduce sylphone, a novel representation for lyrics at syllable-level activated by phoneme identity and vowel stress. We demonstrate that our method can match melody with coherent and singable lyrics with empirical results and intuitive examples. We open source code and provide matching examples on the companion webpage: https://github.com/changhongw/mlm.</description>

      <title>Ambisonics Super-Resolution Using A Waveform-Domain Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ambisonics is a spatial audio format describing a sound field. First-order Ambisonics (FOA) is a popular format comprising only four channels. This limited channel count comes at the expense of spatial accuracy. Ideally one would be able to take the efficiency of a FOA format without its limitations. We have devised a data-driven spatial audio solution that retains the efficiency of the FOA format but achieves quality that surpasses conventional renderers. Utilizing a fully convolutional time-domain audio neural network (Conv-TasNet), we created a solution that takes a FOA input and provides a higher order Ambisonics (HOA) output. This data driven approach is novel when compared to typical physics and psychoacoustic based renderers. Quantitative evaluations showed a 0.6dB average positional mean squared error difference between predicted and actual 3rd order HOA. The median qualitative rating showed an 80% improvement in perceived quality over the traditional rendering approach.</description>

      <title>Beamformed 360{\deg} Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Based Time-Frequency Fingerprinting for Feature Extraction of Traditional Irish Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a wavelet-based approach to time-frequency fingerprinting for time series feature extraction, with a focus on audio identification from live recordings of traditional Irish tunes. The challenges of identifying features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes. This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>VR-PTOLEMAIC: A Virtual Environment for the Perceptual Testing of Spatial Audio Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perceptual evaluation of spatial audio algorithms is an important step in the development of immersive audio applications, as it ensures that synthesized sound fields meet quality standards in terms of listening experience, spatial perception and auditory realism. To support these evaluations, virtual reality can offer a powerful platform by providing immersive and interactive testing environments. In this paper, we present VR-PTOLEMAIC, a virtual reality evaluation system designed for assessing spatial audio algorithms. The system implements the MUSHRA (MUlti-Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor) evaluation methodology into a virtual environment. In particular, users can position themselves in each of the 25 simulated listening positions of a virtually recreated seminar room and evaluate simulated acoustic responses with respect to the actually recorded second-order ambisonic room impulse responses, all convolved with various source signals. We evaluated the usability of the proposed framework through an extensive testing campaign in which assessors were asked to compare the reconstruction capabilities of various sound field reconstruction algorithms. Results show that the VR platform effectively supports the assessment of spatial audio algorithms, with generally positive feedback on user experience and immersivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Real-Time Ambisonics Order Adaptation for Immersive Networked Music Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced remote applications such as Networked Music Performance (NMP) require solutions to guarantee immersive real-world-like interaction among users. Therefore, the adoption of spatial audio formats, such as Ambisonics, is fundamental to let the user experience an immersive acoustic scene. The accuracy of the sound scene reproduction increases with the order of the Ambisonics enconding, resulting in an improved immersivity at the cost of a greater number of audio channels, which in turn escalates both bandwidth requirements and susceptibility to network impairments (e.g., latency, jitter, and packet loss). These factors pose a significant challenge for interactive music sessions, which demand high spatial fidelity and low end-to-end delay. We propose a real-time adaptive higher-order Ambisonics strategy that continuously monitors network throughput and dynamically scales the Ambisonics order. When available bandwidth drops below a preset threshold, the order is lowered to prevent audio dropouts; it then reverts to higher orders once conditions recover, thus balancing immersion and reliability. A MUSHRA-based evaluation indicates that this adaptive approach is promising to guarantee user experience in bandwidth-limited NMP scenarios.</description>

      <title>DeformTune: A Deformable XAI Music Prototype for Non-Musicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many existing AI music generation tools rely on text prompts, complex interfaces, or instrument-like controls, which may require musical or technical knowledge that non-musicians do not possess. This paper introduces DeformTune, a prototype system that combines a tactile deformable interface with the MeasureVAE model to explore more intuitive, embodied, and explainable AI interaction. We conducted a preliminary study with 11 adult participants without formal musical training to investigate their experience with AI-assisted music creation. Thematic analysis of their feedback revealed recurring challenge--including unclear control mappings, limited expressive range, and the need for guidance throughout use. We discuss several design opportunities for enhancing explainability of AI, including multimodal feedback and progressive interaction support. These findings contribute early insights toward making AI music systems more explainable and empowering for novice users.</description>

      <title>Audio Prototypical Network For Controllable Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems represent user preferences in dense representations obtained through black-box encoder models. While these models often provide strong recommendation performance, they lack interpretability for users, leaving users unable to understand or control the system's modeling of their preferences. This limitation is especially challenging in music recommendation, where user preferences are highly personal and often evolve based on nuanced qualities like mood, genre, tempo, or instrumentation. In this paper, we propose an audio prototypical network for controllable music recommendation. This network expresses user preferences in terms of prototypes representative of semantically meaningful features pertaining to musical qualities. We show that the model obtains competitive recommendation performance compared to popular baseline models while also providing interpretable and controllable user profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) refers to the evaluation of speech quality, and developing an accurate automatic SQA method that reflects human perception has become increasingly important, in order to keep up with the generative AI boom. In recent years, SQA has progressed to a point that researchers started to faithfully use automatic SQA in research papers as a rigorous measurement of goodness for speech generation systems. We believe that the scientific challenges and open-source activities of late have stimulated the growth in this field. In this paper, we review recent challenges as well as open-source implementations and toolkits for SQA, and highlight the importance of maintaining such activities to facilitate the development of not only SQA itself but also generative AI for speech.</description>

      <title>Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.</description>

      <title>Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter, enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.</description>

      <title>AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.</description>

      <title>SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.</description>

      <title>OpenACE: An Open Benchmark for Evaluating Audio Coding Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio and speech coding lack unified evaluation and open-source testing. Many candidate systems were evaluated on proprietary, non-reproducible, or small data, and machine learning-based codecs are often tested on datasets with similar distributions as trained on, which is unfairly compared to digital signal processing-based codecs that usually work well with unseen data. This paper presents a full-band audio and speech coding quality benchmark with more variable content types, including traditional open test vectors. An example use case of audio coding quality assessment is presented with open-source Opus, 3GPP's EVS, and recent ETSI's LC3 with LC3+ used in Bluetooth LE Audio profiles. Besides, quality variations of emotional speech encoding at 16 kbps are shown. The proposed open-source benchmark contributes to audio and speech coding democratization and is available at https://github.com/JozefColdenhoff/OpenACE.</description>

      <title>AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</description>

      <title>SwitchCodec: A High-Fidelity Nerual Audio Codec With Sparse Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24437</link>

Abstract: Neural audio compression has emerged as a promising technology for efficiently representing speech, music, and general audio. However, existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation at limited bitrates, where the available embedding space is sharply constrained. To address this, we propose a universal high-fidelity neural audio compression algorithm featuring Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ), which substantially expands the embedding space with minimal impact on bandwidth. A gentle load-balancing strategy is introduced to ensure the full utilization of this expanded space. Furthermore, we develop a novel multi-tiered discriminator that periodically stratifies STFT spectra, guiding the generator to focus on critical spectral regions. To support multiple bitrates without quality loss at the lower end, we adopt an efficient post-training strategy. Our proposed model achieves impressive performance, with PESQ and ViSQOL scores of 2.87 and 4.27, respectively, at 2.67 kbps bandwidth. The approach effectively reduces spectral blur, decreasing the distance to the original mel-spectrogram by 13%. Notably, our post-training strategy achieves performance comparable to dedicated fixed-bitrate models while reducing the required training time by half. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our method over baselines.</description>

      <title>Improving Code Switching with Supervised Fine Tuning and GELU Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are few code switching datasets, labeled or unlabled, that exist today. As a result, ASR requires new methods to utilize the vast monolingual data and models that exist. This paper uses OpenAI's open source ASR model, Whisper, which has been pre-trained on 680K hours of audio to perform monolingual ASR tasks. In Part 1, this paper examines how exploiting Whisper's monolingual ability to individually tokenize training text, called "Switching Tokenizers Method", improves transcription accuracy. In Part 2, we combine the Switching Tokenizers Method from part 1 and train a GELU based adapter on the encoder. These two methods reduced Total Mixed Error Rate (MER) to 9.4% for the ASCEND dataset, 6% for SEAME devman and 9.7% for SEAME devsge, outperforming current SoTA methods.</description>

      <title>Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.</description>
