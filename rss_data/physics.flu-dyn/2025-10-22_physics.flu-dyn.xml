      <title>Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric plates, which become electrically polarised in response to bending, have recently been proposed for water wave energy conversion. However, piezoelectric materials (e.g. Polyvinylidene Fluoride) can be anisotropic, which makes them challenging to model in three dimensions. This paper considers the simpler problem of water wave scattering by an anisotropic elastic plate, i.e., the piezoelectric effect is ignored. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the elastic plate modes. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry. Although not considered in this paper, the method we present is applicable to piezoelectric plates, and thereby facilitates the extension of piezoelectric wave energy converter models to the three dimensional water wave setting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control from a Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal control problem described by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation can be developed into a problem that can be solved by general computational fluid dynamics packages. We describe how this formulation would allow a classical problem in optimal control, Zermelo's problem, to be treated as a multi-fluid problem. This approach has the advantage of allowing optimal navigation problems to be conducted over large areas, as well as to include moderately larger numbers of ships. We draw comparisons between this approach and the field of fluid control for fluid animations in movies.</description>

      <title>How Do Water Filled Traffic Barriers Shake a Suspension Bridge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study stems from the realization that the general problem relating to the analysis of wind-induced vibrations in suspension bridges still requires significant attention. Sidewalk railings, overhaul tracks, and deflectors are known to largely affect such dynamics. Here, the influence of a row of water-filled traffic barriers on the response of a sample suspension bridge is investigated numerically. It is shown that the existence of water barriers causes flow separation and non-negligible vortices with respect to the condition with no water barriers. The vortex shedding frequency at the far end is around 41.30 Hz, relatively close to the real vibration frequency. It is also shown how different incoming angles of attack can change the flow field around the bridge cross-section and the vortex detachment frequency.</description>

      <title>Evidence arguing against the validity of the no-slip boundary condition: blood flow in vivo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption that blood adheres to vessel walls, the ``no-slip'' boundary condition, is a key premise of cardiovascular fluid dynamics. Yet whether it holds true \emph{in vivo} has never been established. Using 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging of the human thoracic aorta combined with Navier--Stokes modeling, we quantified the velocity of blood at the wall. We found tangential wall velocities of about 30--80\% of the mean luminal velocity, providing clear evidence of blood slippage. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the no-slip condition does not apply to blood flow \emph{in vivo}. This finding challenges a fundamental assumption in cardiovascular modeling and directly affects key blood flow characteristics such as pressure drop, vorticity, wall shear stress, and dissipation, which play an important role in clot formation and the development of vascular disease.</description>

      <title>Eddy thermal diffusivity model and mean temperature profiles in turbulent vertical convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a space-dependent eddy thermal diffusivity model for turbulent vertical natural convection in a fluid between two infinite vertical walls at different temperatures. Using this model, we derive analytical results for the mean temperature profile, which reveal two universal scaling functions in the inner region next to the walls and the outer region near the centerline between the two walls. These results are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation data for different Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Weighted integral methods for fluid force diagnostics in incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst surface stress integration remains the standard approach for fluid force evaluation, control-volume integral methods provide deeper physical insights through functional relationships between the flow field and the resultant force. In this work, by introducing a second-order tensor weight function into the Navier-Stokes equations, we develop a novel weighted-integral framework that offers greater flexibility and enhanced capability for fluid force diagnostics in incompressible flows. Firstly, in addition to the total force and moment, the weighted integral methods establish, for the first time, rigorous quantitative connections between the surface stress distribution and the flow field, providing potential advantages for flexible body analyses. Secondly, the weighted integral methods offer alternative perspectives on force mechanisms, through vorticity dynamics or pressure view, when the weight function is set as divergence-free or curl-free, respectively. Thirdly, the derivative moment transformation (DMT)-based integral methods [Wu et al., J. Fluid Mech. 576, 265-286 (2007)] are generalised to weighted formulations, by which the interconnections among the three DMT methods are clarified. In the canonical problem of uniform flow past a circular cylinder, weighted integral methods demonstrate advantages in yielding new force expressions, improving numerical accuracy over original DMT methods, and enhancing surface stress analysis. Finally, a force expression is derived that relies solely on velocity and acceleration at discrete points, without spatial derivatives, offering significant value for experimental force estimation. This weighted integral framework holds significant promise for flow diagnostics in fundamentals and applications.</description>

      <title>Non-linear evolution of the horizontal shear instability in stratified rotating fluids under the complete Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-linear dynamics of horizontal shear instability in an incompressible, stratified and rotating fluid in the non-traditional $f$-plane, i.e. with the full Coriolis acceleration, using direct numerical simulations. The study is restricted to two-dimensional horizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical (traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity components due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three different scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are identified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency $N$ and the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\tilde{f}$ (non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\tilde{f}&lt;N$ for fixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification is strong $N\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz billows like in the traditional limit $\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\gg1$, the governing equations for any $\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for $\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the flow depending on $\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\tilde{f}$ is above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by secondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification, $N\leqslant0.5$ and $\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop vigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence. Concomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in fully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset of secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for instability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear instabilities.</description>

      <title>Multiscale transitional flow in anisotropic nanoparticle suspensions revealed by time-resolved x-ray scatter microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex fluids transition from laminar to transitory flow above a critical control parameter, akin to their Newtonian counterparts. In a continuum mechanics sense, fluid elements follow the ensuing complex trajectories, giving rise to secondary flows in terms of macroscopic vortices and patterns thereof. However, if we replace idealized fluid elements with actual anisotropic nanoparticles, would their trajectories still reveal the same spatiotemporal behavior as the macroscopic flow field? This question is fundamental for complex fluids, where fully developed turbulence is suppressed by high viscosities and where understanding particle-flow coupling is central to transport, processing, and structure formation. To address this question, we develop small-angle x-ray scatter microscopy of unprecedented temporal resolution combined with polarized light imaging, thereby bridging seven orders of magnitude in lengtscales. Proof-of-principle is demonstrated on a classical stability problem, Taylor-Couette flow, of platelet-like graphene oxide nanoparticle and rod-like cellulose nanocrystal suspensions. The analysis shows hitherto hidden, markedly different multiscale dynamics underlying flow stability; while the platelet-like particles follow the wavy motion of the macroscopic, secondary flow field, the rod-like particles exhibit high-frequency motion that is uncorrelated with the vortex instabilities.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics for Mesoscale Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) is a widely used particle-based method for modelling soft matter systems at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, offering thermodynamic consistency and direct control over the fluid's transport properties. Here, we present an SDPD model that incorporates the transport of reactants on scales smaller than the discretising particles, including the evolution of compositional fields. The proposed methodology is well-suited for modelling complex systems governed by advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics. Implemented in LAMMPS, the model is validated using a range of benchmark problems spanning diffusion-dominated, reaction-dominated, and coupled ADR regimes. Our simulation results demonstrate that the implemented SDPD model effectively captures complex behaviours, such as Turing pattern formation. The proposed model holds promise for applications across various fields, including biology, chemistry, materials science, and environmental engineering.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a kerosene liquid jet injected in a high temperature Mach 2 supersonic crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near field liquid structures and penetration of a kerosene jet injected in a Mach 2 crossflow were studied experimentally in the LAPCAT-II Dual Mode Ramjet Combustor at Onera, using high spatial and temporal resolution imaging techniques. The experiments performed in this study provide measurements in high temperature conditions, with kerosene as liquid fuel to bring new data in these conditions. The fuel spray is injected through a single orifice, perpendicularly to the supersonic flow, at temperatures from ambient to 1500 K and jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio from 3.1 to 8.6. Five different test cases are defined to show independently the influence of the injection ratio and the supersonic flow temperature on the liquid jet atomization. A high spatial resolution imaging system is used to detail the characteristic spatial scales of this atomization process in the supersonic crossflow. The surface waves and droplets produced in the windward side of the liquid jet are characterized qualitatively. High-resolution visualizations bring a new insight of the droplet trajectories in the leeward region of the jet. Schlieren imaging is used to detail the complex shock wave structures in such a supersonic flow. Penetration of the kerosene jet is measured by shadowgraphy and schlieren imaging in five test cases and compared to other studies of the literature whenever it is possible. High-speed schlieren performed at 210 kHz is also performed to capture the temporal dynamics of the shocks and measure the liquid jet velocity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing primary atomization of cryogenic LOX/Nitrogen and LOX/Helium sprays by visualizations coupled to Phase Doppler Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a need for experimental data in conditions representative injection in rocket engines to validate or initiate droplet formation models used in numerical simulations. A new cryogenic vessel was built upon the MASCOTTE test bench to study the atomization of a single oxygen liquid jet, under non-reactive conditions, with simultaneous optical diagnostics. A test plan was built to explore the fiber-type regime occurring in liquid rocket injection systems, with a fixed Reynolds number and a large range of Weber number and momentum flux ratio, compared to existing studies. High-speed images are used to describe qualitatively the fiber-type regime and to visualize were droplets are present, in order to prepare the drop-size measurements. A Phase Doppler Interferometer is used to measure the size and velocity of droplets produced by atomization of a liquid oxygen jet by a co-flowing gas. Droplet size and velocity measurements were performed with a PDI close to the nozzle exit in order to provide data on droplets produced by the primary atomization process, which can be useful for numerical simulations initialisation. The radial evolutions of the axial velocity and of the drop size distribution show similar trends as observed in the literature. The axial velocity is investigated for different operating conditions with helium or nitrogen as atomizing gas, showing an increase on the side of the spray. The radial evolution of the droplet size shows a translation of the drop size distribution on the edge of the spray towards the smaller sizes, indicating that the biggest liquid elements stay close to the LOX jet.</description>

      <title>A diffuse-interface method for the containerless freezing of three-phase flows in complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first propose a diffuse-interface model for the freezing processes of three-phase flows in complex geometries, and the core of the model to intergratge the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows, a modified phase-field equation for gas-liquid interfaces, and an enthalpy approach for solid-liquid phase-change processes in a unified diffuse-interface framework. The volume expansion or shrinkage of the liquid phase caused by the density change during the phase-change process is considered by introducing a mass source term into the continuity equation. The wettability effect in such a gas-liquid-solid multiphase system is also included in the phase-field free energy, thereby avoiding the direct discretization of wetting boundary condition on the complex fluid-solid boundary. Then, we develop a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann (LB) method to solve the diffuse-interface model for the freezing processes in multiphase systems, and test the accuracy and efficiency of the LB method through some benchmark problems, including the conduction-induced freezing in a semi-infinite space, the three-phase Stefan problem, the droplet solidification on the flat and curved surfaces. It is found that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data and theoretical solutions. Finally, the LB method is further extended to study the freezing dynamics of multiphase flows in a fracture and porous medium, and the numerical results show that the developed method is efficient in the study of freezing processes of multiphase flows in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Flapping Foils Undergoing Irregular Motion with Application to Wave-Assisted Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flapping foils are widely studied as bioinspired propulsors, yet most investigations have focused on regular, sinusoidal kinematics. In realistic environments, however, irregular motions arise naturally due to environmental disturbances, fluid-structure interactions, and control inputs, but their hydrodynamic consequences remain largely unexplored. One system where response to irregular forcing is particularly relevant is wave-assisted propulsion (WAP) systems where free-to-pitch submerged foils generate thrust due to wave-induced heaving. We employ time-accurate flow simulations of elliptic WAP foils subjected to irregular waves at three different sea-states to gain insights into this system. Our results demonstrate that irregular heaving and pitching can generate greater mean thrust than energetically equivalent sinusoidal heaving. Moreover, a spring-based pitch-limiting mechanism yields higher thrust than an angle-limiter under the same conditions. By leveraging a previously developed leading-edge vortex (LEV) model, we uncover the mechanisms driving this thrust enhancement and highlight the critical interactions between unsteady flow structures and foil dynamics. These findings provide new insights into flapping-foil propulsion in irregular environments and have direct implications for the design and optimization of WAP systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of hydrodynamics in a one-dimensional cold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following model is studied analytically and numerically: point particles with masses $m,\mu,m, \dots$ ($m\geq\mu$) are distributed over the positive half-axis. Their dynamics is initiated by giving a positive velocity to the particle located at the origin; in its course the particles undergo elastic collisions. We show that, for certain values of $m/\mu$, starting from the initial state where the particles are equidistant the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way: (i) the rightmost particle (blast front) moves as $t^{\delta}$ with $\delta &lt; 1$; (ii) recoiled particles behind the front enter the negative half-axis; (iii) the splatter -- the particles with locations $x\leq 0$ -- moves in the ballistic way and eventually takes over the whole energy of the system. These results agree with those obtained in S. Chakraborti et al, SciPost Phys. 2022, 13, 074, for $m/\mu=2$ and random initial particle positions. At the same time, we explicitly found the collection of positive numbers $\{\mathcal{M}_i, i \in \mathbf{N} \}$ such that, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$, $i\leq 700$, the following holds: (a) the splatter is absent; (b) the number of simultaneously moving particles is at most three; (c) the blast front moves in the ballistic way. However, if, similarly as in S. Chakraborti et al, the particle positions are sampled from a uniformly distributed ensemble, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$ the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solid Boundary Treatment in Meshfree Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meshfree particle methods, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method, are widely used to simulate complex free-surface and multiphase flows. A key challenge in these methods is the treatment of solid boundaries, where kernel truncation causes errors and instabilities. Traditional treatments, such as ghost particles and semi-analytical wall corrections, restore kernel completeness but add significant computational cost and complexity, especially for irregular geometries. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework that directly predicts boundary correction terms for particle approximations, eliminating the need for ghost particles or analytical corrections. The framework is based on a hybrid convolutional neural network-multilayer perceptron (CNN-MLP) trained on physics-informed features that capture local geometry, particle states, and kernel properties. Once trained, it provides consistent boundary contributions across all spatial differential operators, including gradients, divergences, and Laplacians. The approach is demonstrated with MPS but is readily extensible to other particle methods such as SPH. Tests with predefined fields, unsteady diffusion, and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows demonstrate accuracy comparable to that of ghost-particle methods while reducing computational overhead. The model generalizes well to unseen geometries, flow conditions, and particle distributions, including dynamically evolving domains. This work establishes a flexible, physics-informed ML paradigm for boundary treatment in particle-based PDE solvers, improving both accuracy and scalability across a broad class of meshfree methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, physics aware deep learning framework for constructing fast and accurate surrogate models of rarefied, shock containing micro nozzle flows. The framework integrates three key components, a Fusion DeepONet operator learning architecture for capturing parameter dependencies, a physics-guided feature space that embeds a shock-aligned coordinate system, and a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits advective steepening and shock like gradients.</description>

      <title>Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection, diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional $N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration $N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter $d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern aerosol behavior.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for the Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite element method (FEM) is a cornerstone numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we present $\textbf{Qu-FEM}$, a fault-tolerant era quantum algorithm for the finite element method. In contrast to other quantum PDE solvers, Qu-FEM preserves the geometric flexibility of FEM by introducing two new primitives, the unit of interaction and the local-to-global indicator matrix, which enable the assembly of global finite element arrays with a constant-size linear combination of unitaries. We study the modified Poisson equation as an elliptic problem of interest, and provide explicit circuits for Qu-FEM in Cartesian domains. For problems with constant coefficients, our algorithm admits block-encodings of global arrays that require only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(d^2 p^2 n\right)$ Clifford+$T$ gates for $d$-dimensional, order-$p$ tensor product elements on grids with $2^n$ degrees of freedom in each dimension, where $n$ is the number of qubits representing the $N=2^n$ discrete grid points. For problems with spatially varying coefficients, we perform numerical integration directly on the quantum computer to assemble global arrays and force vectors. Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced via the method of Lagrange multipliers, eliminating the need to modify the block-encodings that emerge from the assembly procedure. This work presents a framework for extending the geometric flexibility of quantum PDE solvers while preserving the possibility of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Special Relativistic Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Based on Riemann Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel numerical method based on Godunov Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for special relativistic fluid dynamics. Our method utilizes a Riemann solver to describe shock, enhancing accuracy in strong shock waves. The formulation maintains conservation laws and achieves higher accuracy through convolution integrals that define physical quantities for SPH particles. We also propose the number density calculation method that uses a non-equal baryon number in each SPH particle and variable smoothing length in a way different from the conventional method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's robustness across one- and two-dimensional relativistic shock tube problems, as well as its ability to simulate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities accurately, validating SRGSPH as a reliable approach for high-resolution relativistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Sub-Pixel Scale Structured Illumination for Lateral Resolution Enhancement of Non-Diffraction-Limited Flow Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fluid flow imaging, intensity gradients are a good measure of spatial variations in scalar properties, which play an important role in controlling transport processes. However, current flow imaging techniques exhibit system-limited spatial resolutions, thus inhibiting the ability to accurately detect intensity gradients. To address this challenge, we present a method and system, inspired by Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), which can be implemented in dynamic flow imaging to enhance pixel resolution and, thereby, the estimation of scalar gradients. We utilize sub-pixel-scale patterned light matching the system pixel scale and multi-frame imaging that creates quasi-static images over four frames, with scalability for high-speed imaging. These multi-frame images are then processed using a bespoke recombination algorithm that produces a new image with twice the pixel resolution compared to the original images. The sub-pixel spatial-resolution enhancement capabilities are shown with static images and dynamic fluid flow, for which enhancement in the flow gradient is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A validated fluid-structure interaction simulation model for vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe in steady flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a validated fluid-structure interaction simulation framework based on strip methods for the vortex-induced vibration of a flexible pipe. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data from three previous steady flow conditions: uniform, linearly sheared, and bidirectionally sheared flow. The Reynolds number ranges from $10^4$ to $10^5$. The flow field is simulated via the RANS model, which is based on the open-source software OpenFOAM. The solid field is modeled based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, and fluid-structure coupling is implemented via a weak coupling algorithm developed in MATLAB. The vortex-induced vibration response is assessed in terms of amplitude and frequency, along with the differences in strain. Additionally, wavelet analysis and traveling wave phenomena are investigated. The numerical simulation codes and experimental data in this manuscript are openly available, providing a foundation for more complex vortex-induced vibration simulations in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid thermodynamics underpins atmospheric dynamics, climate science, industrial applications, and energy systems. However, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such systems can be computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a novel physics-informed spatiotemporal surrogate model for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC), a canonical example of convective fluid flow. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks, for spatial dimension reduction, with an innovative recurrent architecture, inspired by large language models, to model long-range temporal dynamics. Inference is penalized with respect to the governing partial differential equations to ensure physical interpretability. Since RBC exhibits turbulent behavior, we quantify uncertainty using a conformal prediction framework. This model replicates key physical features of RBC dynamics while significantly reducing computational cost, offering a scalable alternative to DNS for long-term simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional evolution of perturbed long weakly-nonlinear surface plane, ring, and hybrid waves, consisting, to leading order, of a part of a ring and two tangent plane waves, is modelled numerically within the scope of the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine system. Numerical runs are initiated and interpreted using the reduced 2+1-dimensional cKdV-type and KPII equations. The cKdV-type equation leads to two different models, the KdV$\theta$ and cKdV equations, depending on whether we use the general or singular (i.e. the envelope of the general) solution of the associated nonlinear first-order differential equation. The KdV$\theta$ equation is also derived directly from the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine system and used to analytically describe the intermediate 2D asymptotics of line solitons subject to sufficiently long transverse perturbations of finite strength, while the cKdV equation is used to initiate outward- and inward-propagating ring waves with localised and periodic perturbations. Both of these equations, together with the KPII equation, are used to model the evolution of hybrid waves, where we show, in particular, that large localised waves (lumps) can appear as transient (emerging and then disappearing) states in the evolution of inward-propagating waves, contributing to the possible mechanisms for the generation of rogue waves. Detailed comparisons are made between the key features of the non-stationary two-dimensional modelling and relevant predictions of the reduced equations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Reynolds number dependence of the chaotic attractor in two-dimensional turbulence with dimension-minimizing autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep autoencoder neural networks can generate highly accurate, low-order representations of turbulence. We design a new family of autoencoders which are a combination of a 'dense-block' encoder-decoder structure (Page et al, J. Fluid Mech. 991, 2024), an 'implicit rank minimization' series of linear layers acting on the embeddings (Zeng et al, Mach. Learn. Sci. Tech. 5, 2024) and a full discrete+continuous symmetry reduction. These models are applied to two-dimensional turbulence in Kolmogorov flow for a range of Reynolds numbers $25 \leq Re \leq 400$, and used to estimate the dimension of the chaotic attractor, $d_{\mathcal A}(Re)$. We find that the dimension scales like $\sim Re^{1/3}$ -- much weaker than known bounds on the global attractor which grow like $Re^{4/3}$. In addition, two-dimensional maps of the latent space in our models reveal a rich structure not seen in previous studies, including multiple classes of high-dissipation events at lower $Re$ which guide bursting trajectories. We visualize the embeddings of large numbers of "turbulent" unstable periodic orbits, which the model indicates are distinct (in terms of features) from any flow snapshot in a large turbulent dataset, suggesting their dynamical irrelevance. This is in sharp contrast to their appearance in more traditional low-dimensional projections, in which they appear to lie within the turbulent attractor.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Turbulence via an Instanton Gas Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling synthetic turbulent fields as a computationally tractable surrogate for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is an important practical problem in various applications, and allows to test our physical understanding of the main features of real turbulent flows. Reproducing higher-order Eulerian correlation functions, as well as Lagrangian particle statistics, requires an accurate representation of coherent structures of the flow in the synthetic turbulent fields. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic coherent-structure based method for sampling synthetic random fields, based on a superposition of instanton configurations - an instanton gas - from the field-theoretic formulation of turbulence. We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of instantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian fluctuations around them. The resulting Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics are evaluated numerically and compared against DNS results, as well as Gaussian and log-normal cascade models that lack coherent structures. The instanton gas approach is illustrated via the example of one-dimensional Burgers turbulence throughout this paper, and we show that already a canonical ensemble of non-interacting instantons without fluctuations reproduces DNS statistics very well. Finally, we outline extensions of the method to higher dimensions, in particular to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence for future applications to cosmic ray propagation.</description>

      <title>PDE-Free Mass-Constrained Learning of Complex Systems with Hidden States: The crowd dynamics case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.</description>
