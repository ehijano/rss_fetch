      <title>PIC analysis of spatiotemporal THz emission from radial and longitudinal wakefields via copropagating chirped lasers in magnetized rippled plasma</title>

Abstract: The excitation of radial and longitudinal wake-fields by two co-propagating chirped laser pulses in a rippled, magnetized plasma has been examined. This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal evolution of wake structures and assess their role in the generation of THz radiation. A Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulation framework, optimized for cylindrical geometries, has been employed to model the relativistic dynamics of plasma electrons under the combined influence of laser-induced ponderomotive forces and an external magnetic field. It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density. Distinct THz peaks have been identified in the Fourier-transformed spectra, with their amplitudes enhanced by resonant coupling between wake-field harmonics and the laser frequency modulation. Moreover, electron motion has been confined by the magnetic field, leading to improved energy gain and shaping of angular radiation patterns. These findings suggest that tailored laser and plasma configurations can be used to optimize energy transfer mechanisms, paving the way for more efficient wake-field usage and THz generation.</description>

      <title>3D PIC simulation and theoretical modeling of RF Laser pulse in magnetized plasma for the generation of multidimensional relativistic Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study, investigates the modulation of plasma wakefields in dense magnetized plasma driven by relativistic electron beams under transverse RF excitation. A self consistent theoretical framework, comprising the RF vector potential, Maxwells equations, and relativistic electron motion, is extended through full 3D electromagnetic particle in cell simulations. The results reveal systematic amplification and reshaping of wakefields under the combined action of external magnetic fields and RF drivers. Variations in the cyclotron to plasma frequency ratio dictate the radial positioning and gyromotion of plasma electrons, sharpening transverse confinement and stabilizing blowout structures. The RF amplitude introduces progressive modulation of radial excursions and transverse forces, enhancing wakefield symmetry and depth. Current density distributions confirm the nonlinear scaling with RF strength, evolving from weak perturbations into sharply structured ion channels. Scalar potentials and longitudinal fields exhibit pronounced sensitivity to pulse shape, polarization angle, frequency ratio, and driver density, each parameter producing distinct oscillatory features and confinement regimes. Plasma density sets the field strength and radial localization, while the modulation parameter governs the emergence of fine scale oscillatory bands, producing smooth to multiband transitions in longitudinal electric fields. Across all conditions, simulations confirm the reinforcement of ponderomotive force, resulting in controlled narrowing of electron sheaths, sharper scalar potential gradients, and extended acceleration zones.</description>
