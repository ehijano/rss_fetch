      <title>Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we model USD-CNY bilateral exchange rate fluctuations as a general stochastic process and incorporate monetary policy shock to examine how bilateral exchange rate fluctuations affect the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index. Numerical simulations indicate that as the mean of bilateral exchange rate fluctuations increases, i.e., currency devaluation, the RCA index rises. Moreover, smaller bilateral exchange rate fluctuations after the policy shock cause the RCA index to gradually converge toward its mean level. For the empirical analysis, we select the USD-CNY bilateral exchange rate and provincial manufacturing industry export competitiveness data in China from 2008 to 2021. We find that in the short term, when exchange rate fluctuations stabilize within a range less than 0.2 RMB depreciation will effectively boost export competitiveness. Then, the 8.11 exchange rate policy reversed the previous linear trend of the CNY, stabilizing it within a narrow fluctuation range over the long term. This policy leads to a gradual convergence of provincial RCA indices toward a relatively high level, which is commensurate with our numerical simulations, and indirectly enhances provincial export competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Forecasting in small open emerging economies Evidence from Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting inflation in small open economies is difficult because limited time series and strong external exposures create an imbalance between few observations and many potential predictors. We study this challenge using Thailand as a representative case, combining more than 450 domestic and international indicators. We evaluate modern Bayesian shrinkage and factor models, including Horseshoe regressions, factor-augmented autoregressions, factor-augmented VARs, dynamic factor models, and Bayesian additive regression trees.
  Our results show that factor models dominate at short horizons, when global shocks and exchange rate movements drive inflation, while shrinkage-based regressions perform best at longer horizons. These models not only improve point and density forecasts but also enhance tail-risk performance at the one-year horizon.
  Shrinkage diagnostics, on the other hand, additionally reveal that Google Trends variables, especially those related to food essential goods and housing costs, progressively rotate into predictive importance as the horizon lengthens. This underscores their role as forward-looking indicators of household inflation expectations in small open economies.</description>
