      <title>Investigating baryon-strangeness and charge-strangeness correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10939v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions and the properties of quark$-$gluon plasma, the ALICE collaboration at CERN has conducted an extensive analysis of the correlations among net-conserved quantities, namely net-baryon, net-charge, and net-strangeness. These correlations are essential for understanding the QCD phase structure, as they are directly connected to ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities calculated in lattice QCD. This analysis focuses on the correlations between net-kaon and net-proton, as well as net-kaon and net-charge, in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, where net-proton and net-kaon serve as effective proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. A comparison with theoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model sheds light on the role of resonance decays and the effects of charge conservation laws in shaping these correlations. Furthermore, the measurements show sensitivity to the correlation volume in which these conservation laws are applied, underscoring the importance of modeling the underlying dynamics to fully understand the experimental results on fluctuations and correlations in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of photonuclear jet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, the photoproduction of high-energy jets can be used to constrain nuclear parton distributions for a wide range of parton kinematics. Results are presented from a measurement of photonuclear production of dijet and multi-jet final states in ultra-peripheral \mbox{Pb+Pb} collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a data set recorded in 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.72 $\text{nb}^{-1}$. Photonuclear final states are selected by requiring a rapidity gap in the photon direction; this selects events where one of the outgoing nuclei remains intact. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_\text{t}$ algorithm with radius parameter, $R = 0.4$. Triple-differential cross-sections, unfolded for detector response, are measured and presented using two sets of kinematic variables. The first set consists of the total transverse momentum ($H_\text{T}$), rapidity, and mass of the jet system. The second set uses $H_\text{T}$ and particle-level nuclear and photon parton momentum fractions, $x_\text{A}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, respectively. The results are compared with leading-order perturbative QCD calculations of photonuclear jet production cross-sections, demonstrating their potential to provide a strong new constraint on nuclear parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low $Q_\beta$ value for the allowed decay of $^{110}$Ag$^m$ confirmed via mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass of $^{109}$Ag isotope was measured with respect to $^{110}$Cd with the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique using the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap at the IGISOL facility. By combining this new result with the known spectroscopic information, the $Q_\beta$ value of $405(135)$ eV between the $6^+$ isomer of $^{110}$Ag and the $5^+_2$ state in $^{110}$Cd was determined. This is the lowest $Q_\beta$ for any allowed transition observed to date. The nuclear shell-model results were performed with the {\sc kshell} code employing the \textit{jj45pnb} interaction, and combined with the state-of-the-art atomic calculations. The theoretical partial half-life, $2.23^{+5.24}_{-1.28} \times 10^7$ years, and the resulting branching ratio, $3.07^{+4.16}_{-2.15} \times 10^{-8}$, combined with a viable production method, thermal-neutron capture on stable $^{109}$Ag, make $^{110}$Ag$^{m}$ as a promising candidate for future antineutrino mass measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions (${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$) and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer ($Q^2$), for fixed values of $Q^2$ and for fixed values of 3-momentum transfer $\bf q$. The data sample consists of approximately 10,000 differential electron scattering and photo-absorption-cross section measurement points for ${\rm ^{12}C}$. In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Since the extracted response functions and the universal fit cover a large range of $Q^2$ and $\nu$, they can be readily used for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validating and tuning Monte Carlo generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, QE, and $\Delta$(1232) regions and compare the measurements to predictions of the following theoretical approaches: ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC), "Correlated Fermi Gas" (CFG), as well as the {\textsc{NuWro}}, \ {{\sc{achilles}}}~ and {{\sc{genie}}}~generators. We find that among all the models ED-RMF provides the best description of both the QE and {\it nuclear excitations} response functions over the largest kinematic range $0.01\le Q^2 \le 1.25$ GeV$^2$. The ED-RMF formalism has the added benefit that it should be directly applicable to the same kinematic regions for neutrino scattering.</description>

      <title>Higher forbidden unique $\beta^-$ decay transitions and shell-model interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we have predicted the half-lives for the $\beta^{-}$ decay for higher forbidden unique transitions in the mass range of nuclei from A = 40-138. For these transitions, the experimental data for half-lives are not available except for a few cases. The calculations for half-lives are performed within the framework of the nuclear shell model (SM). We have used the effective interactions sdpf-mu, gxpf1a, gwbxg, G-matrix, snet, sn100pn, and jj56pnb to perform the SM calculations in different mass regions. A comprehensive discussion has been made between the SM-predicted half-lives and the scaled half-lives from proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA). The results of the present study will be useful to plan new experiments to measure half-lives for these higher forbidden unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of exclusive $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, and electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$) pair photoproduction in Au$+$Au ultra-peripheral collisions are reported by the STAR experiment at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200~\rm{GeV}$. We report several first measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, which are i) $J/\psi$ photoproduction with large momentum transfer up to $2.2~\rm{(GeV/c)^{2}}$, ii) coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction associated with neutron emissions from nuclear breakup, iii) the rapidity dependence of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction, iv) the $\psi(2s)$ photoproduction cross section at mid-rapidity, and v) $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair photoproduction up to high invariant mass of 6 $\rm{GeV/c^2}$. For measurement ii), the coherent $J/\psi$ total cross section of $\gamma^{\ast} + \rm{Au} \rightarrow J/\psi + \rm{Au}$ as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W_{\rm{\gamma* N}}$ has been obtained without photon energy ambiguities. The data are quantitatively compared with the Monte Carlo models STARlight, Sartre, BeAGLE, and theoretical calculations of gluon saturation with color glass condensate, nuclear shadowing with leading twist approximation, Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Next-to-Leading Order perturbative QCD. At the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 25.0 GeV, the coherent and incoherent $J/\psi$ cross sections of Au nuclei are found to be $71\pm10\%$ and $36\pm7\%$, respectively, of that of free protons. These data provide an important experimental constraint for nuclear parton distribution functions and a unique opportunity to advance the understanding of the nuclear modification effect at the top RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV and Au+Au collisions at 0.2 TeV, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle.' These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire \(p_T\) and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities (\(\varepsilon_{n}\)), dimensionless size (\(\mathbb{R}\)), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function (\(\delta_f\)), the medium's stopping power (\(\Hat{q}\)), and specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a rotating hadron resonance gas with van der Waals interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying the thermodynamics of the systems produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is crucial in understanding the QCD phase diagram. Recently, a new avenue has opened regarding the implications of large initial angular momentum and subsequent vorticity in the medium evolution in high-energy collisions. This adds a new type of chemical potential into the partonic and hadronic systems, called the rotational chemical potential. We study the thermodynamics of an interacting hadronic matter under rotation, formed in an ultra-relativistic collision. We introduce attractive and repulsive interactions through the van der Waals equation of state. Thermodynamic properties like the pressure ($P$), energy density ($\varepsilon$), entropy density ($s$), trace anomaly ($(\varepsilon - 3P)/T^{4}$), specific heat ($c_{\rm v}$) and squared speed of sound ($c_{\rm s}^{2}$) are studied as functions of temperature ($T$) for zero and finite rotation chemical potential. The conserved charge fluctuations, which can be quantified by their respective susceptibilities, are also studied. The rotational (spin) density corresponding to the rotational chemical potential is explored. In addition, we explore the possible liquid-gas phase transition in the hadron gas with van der Waals interaction in the $T$ -- $\omega$ phase space.</description>

      <title>Impact of Medium Anisotropy on Quarkonium Dissociation and Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production in ultra-relativistic collisions plays a crucial role in probing the existence of hot QCD matter. This study explores quarkonia states dissociation and regeneration in the hot QCD medium while considering momentum anisotropy. The net quarkonia decay width ($\Gamma_{D}$) arises from two essential processes: collisional damping and gluonic dissociation. The quarkonia regeneration includes the transition from octet to singlet states within the anisotropic medium. Our study utilizes a medium-modified potential that incorporates anisotropy via particle distribution functions. This modified potential gives rise to collisional damping for quarkonia due to the surrounding medium, as well as the transition of quarkonia from singlet to octet states due to interactions with gluons. Furthermore, we employ the detailed balance approach to investigate the regeneration of quarkonia within this medium. Our comprehensive analysis spans various temperature settings, transverse momentum values, and anisotropic strengths. Notably, we find that, in addition to medium temperatures and heavy quark transverse momentum, anisotropy significantly influences the dissociation and regeneration of various quarkonia states.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study of $^{28}$Si: coexistence of oblate, prolate and superdeformed shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the shape coexistence in the nucleus $^{28}$Si with the nuclear shell model using numerical diagonalizations complemented with variational calculations based on the projected generator-coordinate method. The theoretical electric quadrupole moments and transitions as well as the collective wavefunctions indicate that the standard USDB interaction in the $sd$ shell describes well the ground-state oblate rotational band, but misses the experimental prolate band. Guided by the quasi-SU(3) model, we show that the prolate band can be reproduced in the $sd$ shell by reducing the energy of the $0d_{3/2}$ orbital. Alternatively, in the extended $sdpf$ configuration space a modification of the SDPF-NR interaction that accommodates cross-shell excitations also reproduces the oblate and prolate bands. Finally, we address the possibility of superdeformation in $^{28}$Si within the $sdpf$ space. Our results indicate that superdeformed structures appear at about $18$-$20$~MeV.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>
