      <title>LiveNet: Robust, Minimally Invasive Multi-Robot Control for Safe and Live Navigation in Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways, hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile, non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested, conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness, which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20 times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states, among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet{https://github.com/srikarg89/LiveNet.</description>

      <title>Breaking Event Rumor Detection via Stance-Separated Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media platforms during breaking events severely hinders the dissemination of the truth. Previous studies reveal that the lack of annotated resources hinders the direct detection of unforeseen breaking events not covered in yesterday's news. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for rumor detection holds significant promise. However, it is challenging for LLMs to provide comprehensive responses to complex or controversial issues due to limited diversity. In this work, we propose the Stance Separated Multi-Agent Debate (S2MAD) to address this issue. Specifically, we firstly introduce Stance Separation, categorizing comments as either supporting or opposing the original claim. Subsequently, claims are classified as subjective or objective, enabling agents to generate reasonable initial viewpoints with different prompt strategies for each type of claim. Debaters then follow specific instructions through multiple rounds of debate to reach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, a judge agent evaluates the opinions and delivers a final verdict on the claim's veracity. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and effectively improves the performance of LLMs in breaking event rumor detection.</description>

      <title>HyperGraphOS: A Meta Operating System for Science and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents HyperGraphOS, an innovative Operating System designed for the scientific and engineering domains. It combines model based engineering, graph modeling, data containers, and computational tools, offering users a dynamic workspace for creating and managing complex models represented as customizable graphs. Using a web based architecture, HyperGraphOS requires only a modern browser to organize knowledge, documents, and content into interconnected models. Domain Specific Languages drive workspace navigation, code generation, AI integration, and process organization.The platform models function as both visual drawings and data structures, enabling dynamic modifications and inspection, both interactively and programmatically. HyperGraphOS was evaluated across various domains, including virtual avatars, robotic task planning using Large Language Models, and meta modeling for feature based code development. Results show significant improvements in flexibility, data management, computation, and document handling.</description>

      <title>TeamCraft: A Benchmark for Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Systems in Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaboration is a cornerstone of society. In the real world, human teammates make use of multi-sensory data to tackle challenging tasks in ever-changing environments. It is essential for embodied agents collaborating in visually-rich environments replete with dynamic interactions to understand multi-modal observations and task specifications. To evaluate the performance of generalizable multi-modal collaborative agents, we present TeamCraft, a multi-modal multi-agent benchmark built on top of the open-world video game Minecraft. The benchmark features 55,000 task variants specified by multi-modal prompts, procedurally-generated expert demonstrations for imitation learning, and carefully designed protocols to evaluate model generalization capabilities. We also perform extensive analyses to better understand the limitations and strengths of existing approaches. Our results indicate that existing models continue to face significant challenges in generalizing to novel goals, scenes, and unseen numbers of agents. These findings underscore the need for further research in this area. The TeamCraft platform and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/teamcraft-bench/teamcraft.</description>

      <title>CPIG: Leveraging Consistency Policy with Intention Guidance for Multi-agent Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient exploration is crucial in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in sparse-reward settings. However, due to the reliance on the unimodal policy, existing methods are prone to falling into the local optima, hindering the effective exploration of better policies. Furthermore, in sparse-reward settings, each agent tends to receive a scarce reward, which poses significant challenges to inter-agent cooperation. This not only increases the difficulty of policy learning but also degrades the overall performance of multi-agent tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Consistency Policy with Intention Guidance (CPIG), with two primary components: (a) introducing a multimodal policy to enhance the agent's exploration capability, and (b) sharing the intention among agents to foster agent cooperation. For component (a), CPIG incorporates a Consistency model as the policy, leveraging its multimodal nature and stochastic characteristics to facilitate exploration. Regarding component (b), we introduce an Intention Learner to deduce the intention on the global state from each agent's local observation. This intention then serves as a guidance for the Consistency Policy, promoting cooperation among agents. The proposed method is evaluated in multi-agent particle environments (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo). Empirical results demonstrate that our method not only achieves comparable performance to various baselines in dense-reward environments but also significantly enhances performance in sparse-reward settings, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms by 20%.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Stochastic Control in Standard Borel Spaces: Centralized MDP Reductions, Near Optimality of Finite Window Local Information, and Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite, linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The separated nature of policies under both information structures is then established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem, which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.</description>
