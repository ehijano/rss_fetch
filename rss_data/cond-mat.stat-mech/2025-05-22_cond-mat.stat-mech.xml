      <title>Two types of $q$-Gaussian distributions used to study the diffusion in a finite region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore both the ordinary $q$-Gaussian distribution and a new one defined here, determining both their mean and variance, and we use them to construct solutions of the $q$-deformed diffusion differential equation. This approach allows us to realize that the standard deviation of the distribution must be a function of time. In one case, we derive a linear Fokker-Planck equation within a finite region, revealing a new form of both the position- and time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the corresponding continuity equation. It is noteworthy that, in both cases, the conventional result is obtained when $q$ tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the deformed diffusion-decay equation in a finite region, also determining the position- and time-dependent decay coefficient. A discrete version of this diffusion-decay equation is addressed, in which the discrete times have a uniform interval, while for the discrete positions the interval is not uniform.</description>

      <title>Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of run-and-tumble motion as jump-process: the case of a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By mapping run-and-tumble motion onto jump-process (a process in which a particle, instead of moving continuously in time, performs consequential jumps), a system in a steady-state can be formulated as an integral equation. The key ingredient of this formulation is the transition operator $G(x,x')$, representing the probability distribution of jumps along the $x$-axis for a particle located at $x'$ before a jump. For particles in a harmonic trap, exact expressions for $G(x,x')$ are obtained and, in principle, $G(x,x')$ has all the information about a stationary distribution $\rho(x)$. One way to extract $\rho$ is to use the condition of stationarity, $\rho(x) = \int dx' \, \rho(x') G(x,x')$, resulting in an integral equation formulation of the problem. For the system in dimension $d=2$, there is an unexpected reduction of complexity; the expression for $G(x,x')$ is found to be reversible, which implies that $\rho(x)$ (within the jump-process interpretation) obeys the detailed balance condition, and $\rho$ can be obtained from the detailed balance relation, $\rho(x') G(x,x') = \rho(x) G(x',x)$.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of non-linear observables of fractal Gaussian fields with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical properties of non-linear observables of the fractal Gaussian field $\phi(\vec x)$ of negative Hurst exponent $H&lt;0$ in dimension $d$ are revisited with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on the properties of the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $. For the special case $n=2$ of quadratic observables, explicit results include the cumulants of arbitrary order, the L\'evy-Khintchine formula for the characteristic function and the anomalous large deviations properties. The case of observables of arbitrary order $n&gt;2$ is analyzed via the Wiener-Ito chaos-expansion for functionals of the white noise: the multiple stochastic Ito integrals are useful to identify the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $ and to compute their correlations involving the Hurst exponents $H_n=nH$.</description>

      <title>To reset or not to reset in a finite domain: that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to non-vanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for a monoparametric family of distributions, to shed light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for the optimal search strategy, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo approach to quantum work in strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Monte Carlo framework to analyze the statistics of quantum work in correlated electron systems. Using the Ising-Kondo model in heavy fermions as a paradigmatic platform, we thoroughly illustrate the process of determining the moment generating function of quantum work under nonequilibrium conditions in detail. Based on this function, we systematically investigate essential statistical quantities, including the mean irreversible work density, the mean work density, variance, and the third central moment of quantum work across different quench processes. Our findings highlight distinct singularities in these quantities at the metal-insulator phase transition point at low temperatures. However, these singularities disappear, and the transition becomes a smooth crossover at high temperatures. This stark contrast underscores quantum work as an effective thermodynamic tool for identifying metal-insulator phase transitions. Our approach provides a promising new framework for investigating nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipatively dressed quasiparticles in boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains experiencing strong boundary dissipation is accounted by introducing quasiparticles with a renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. This allows us to evaluate the spectrum of the NESS in terms of the Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system which has the same set of eigenstates, the so-called dissipation-projected Hamiltonian. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of the XXX and XXZ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as the XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, substantially altering the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Analysis for Harmonic Oscillator with Position-Dependent Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic behavior of a quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass (PDM), where spatial inhomogeneity is modeled through a deformation parameter {\alpha}. Based on the exact energy spectrum, we explore the resulting thermodynamic quantities and superstatistics. Our findings reveal that increasing {\alpha} leads to a decrease in entropy and specific heat, reflecting a confinement-induced reduction in the number of accessible states. The partition function and free energy exhibit smooth behavior across all parameter regimes, indicating the absence of critical phase transitions. This study underscores the influence of mass deformation on quantum thermal responses and demonstrates that, while the overall thermodynamic trends are consistent with those reported in the literature, certain distinctive features emerge due to the specific form of the deformation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling and high-density specific heat of simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original Rosenfeld-Tarazona (RT) scaling of the excess energy in simple dense fluids predicts a $\propto T^{3/5}$ thermal correction to the fluid Madelung energy. This implies that the excess isochoric heat capacity scales as $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-2/5}$. Careful examination performed in this paper demonstrates that the exponent $-2/5$ is not always optimal. For instance, in the Lennard-Jones fluid in some vicinity of the triple point, the exponent $-1/3$ turns out to be more appropriate. The analysis of the specific heat data in neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and liquid mercury reveals that no single value of the exponent exists, describing all the data simultaneously. Therefore we propose a generalized RT scaling in the form $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a density- and material-dependent adjustable parameter. The question concerning which material properties and parameters affect the exponent $\alpha$ and whether it can be predicted from general physical arguments requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Laser-cooled ions in electromagnetic traps present a pristine and highly controllable, few-body system for examining this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trapping potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a lattice instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. Notably, we observe a triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate tunable Coulomb clusters as a versatile platform to investigate how symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways govern structural transitions in confined few-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.</description>

      <title>Extreme value statistics and eigenstate thermalization in kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often expected (and assumed) for a quantum chaotic system that the presence of correlated eigenvalues implies that all the other properties as dictated by random matrix theory are satisfied. We demonstrate using the spin-$1/2$ kicked field Ising model that this is not necessarily true. We study the properties of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for this model, which constitutes the entanglement spectrum. It is shown that the largest eigenvalue does not follow the expected Tracy--Widom distribution even for the large system sizes considered. The distribution instead follows the extreme value distribution of Weibull type. Furthermore, we also show that such deviations do not lead to drastic change in the thermalization property of this system by showing that the models satisfy the diagonal and off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Finally, we study the spin-spin autocorrelation function and numerically show that it has the characteristic behavior for chaotic systems: it decreases exponentially and saturates to a value at late time that decreases with system size.</description>

      <title>Role of Translational Noise in Motility-Induced Phase Separation of Hard Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. Upon increasing the translational diffusivity, we find that clusters become more rounded (less fractal), eventually transitioning to genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters melt down. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.</description>

      <title>The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 &lt; \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta&lt;0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m&gt;0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)&lt;\eta&lt;1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined scale.This implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Major issues in theory of Bose-Einstein condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major issues arising in the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation are reviewed. These issues, although being principally important, are very often misunderstood, which results in wrong conclusions. The basic point is global gauge symmetry breaking that is a necessary and sufficient condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. Paying no attention to this basic point is a common fallacy leading to a number of confusions. For instance, the attempt of describing Bose condensation without gauge symmetry breaking produces the so-called ``grand canonical catastrophe" that actually does not exist in the correct description of Bose condensation accompanied by gauge symmetry breaking. The other common flaw is forgetting to consider the stability of the studied systems. One sometimes accomplishes lengthy calculations and discusses the properties of a system that in reality cannot exist being unstable. In some cases, the seeming instability is caused by the negligence of the simple mathematical reason teaching us that one should not go beyond the approximation applicability. An example of such an artificial instability is related to the appearance of the so-called ``thermodynamically anomalous fluctuations" whose arising is due to the use of a second-order approximation for calculating fourth-order terms, in this way distorting the $O(2)$-class model of a Bose-condensed system to the Gaussian-class model. These and other principal points, important for the correct treatment of Bose-condensed systems, are reviewed, including the resolution of the Hohenberg-Martin dilemma of gapless versus conserving theories for Bose-condensed systems and the problem of statistical ensemble equivalence.</description>

      <title>Fast and high-fidelity transfer of edge states via dynamical control of topological phases and effects of dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone for describing nanoscale and open quantum systems. However, formulating these laws for systems under continuous feedback control and under experimentally relevant conditions is challenging. In this work, we lay out a formalism for the laws of thermodynamics in an open quantum system under continuous measurement and feedback described by a Quantum Fokker Planck Master Equation. We derive expressions for work, heat, and measurement-induced energy changes, and we investigate entropy production and fluctuation theorems. We illustrate our results with a continuous version of a measurement-driven Szilard engine, as well as a work extraction scheme in a two-level system under bang-bang control. Our results provide insights into the energetics as well as the irreversibility of classical and quantum systems under continuous feedback control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the typical behavior of random walkers on the microcanonical configuration space of mean-field disordered systems. Passive walks have an ergodicity-breaking transition at precisely the energy density associated with the dynamical glass transition, but persistent walks remain ergodic at lower energies. In models where the energy landscape is thoroughly understood, we show that, in the limit of infinite persistence time, the ergodicity-breaking transition coincides with a transition in the topology of microcanonical configuration space. We conjecture that this correspondence generalizes to other models, and use it to determine the topological transition energy in situations where the landscape properties are ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap appears at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. Our results not only confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework but also highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</description>

Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then, an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the open ASEP (one extremal-current phase) or in the conventional KLS model (one or three extremal-current phases).</description>

      <title>Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>On the foundations of statistical mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although not as wide, and popular, as that of quantum mechanics, the investigation of fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics constitutes an important research field in the building of modern physics. Besides the interest for itself, both for physicists and philosophers, and the obvious pedagogical motivations, there is a further, compelling reason for a thorough understanding of the subject. The fast development of models and methods at the edge of the established domain of the field requires indeed a deep reflection on the essential aspects of the theory, which are at the basis of its success. These elements should never be disregarded when trying to expand the domain of statistical mechanics to systems with novel, little known features. It is thus important to (re)consider in a careful way the main ingredients involved in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Among those, a primary role is covered by the dynamical aspects (e.g. presence of chaos), the emergence of collective features for large systems, and the use of probability in the building of a consistent statistical description of physical systems. With this goal in mind, in the present review we aim at providing a consistent picture of the state of the art of the subject, both in the classical and in the quantum realm. In particular, we will highlight the similarities of the key technical and conceptual steps with emphasis on the relevance of the many degrees of freedom, to justify the use of statistical ensembles in the two domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system comprising of $N$ run-and-tumble particles confined in a harmonic trap interacting via a repulsive inverse-square power-law interaction. We numerically compute the global density profile in the steady state which shows interesting crossovers between three different regimes: as the activity increases, we observe a change from a density with sharp peaks characteristic of a crystal region to a smooth bell-shaped density profile, passing through the intermediate stage of a smooth Wigner semi-circle characteristic of a liquid phase. We also investigate analytically the crossover between the crystal and the liquid regions by computing the covariance of the positions of these particles in the steady state in the weak noise limit. It is achieved by using the method introduced in Touzo {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014136 (2024)] to study the active Dyson Brownian motion. Our analytical results are corroborated by thorough numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</description>

This bound implies the critical exponent inequality $z \geq 2$, thereby rigorously improving the previously known estimate $z \geq 2 - \eta$. Our proof relies on the mapping from stochastic processes to frustration-free quantum systems and leverages the Simon--Lieb and Gosset--Huang inequalities.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.100601}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating four-body interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantum Thermodynamic Engine under an Isothermal Operation: An Application of a Thouless Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a geometric formalism for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of a small system coupled to external isothermal reservoirs as an application of Thouless pumping, where the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs and parameters in the system's Hamiltonian are adiabatically controlled. By analyzing the quantum master equation for the Anderson model of a quantum dot under the wide-band approximation, we obtain the work and effective efficiency of the thermodynamic engine as functions of the phase difference between the externally controlled electrochemical potentials after the system reaches a geometric cyclic state. Since the entropy production is negligible in adiabatic operations, the process we consider is reversible, analogous to the Carnot cycle.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of Quantum Cellular Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Inducing a transition between thermal and many-body localized states and detecting many-body mobility edges through dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in MBL physics. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we suggest the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.</description>

      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning of the many-body critical phase, phase transitions, and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a three-dimensional (3D) tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical model) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, using layer susceptibility, we obtain the boundary operator expansion for the transverse and longitudinal modes within the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos, which is interpreted as a ``mixing" time. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. Further, a hierarchy of $t_{\text{Lyapunov}} &lt; t_{\text{chaos}} &lt; t_{\text{thermalization}}$ is found in these models. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, numerous ensembles have been devised, ranging from Gibbs ensembles such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles to a variety of generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. Our analysis shows that employing an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. We also numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for small finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.</description>
