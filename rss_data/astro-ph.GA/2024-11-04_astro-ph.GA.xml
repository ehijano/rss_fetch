      <title>The Lyman Alpha Reference Sample. XVI. Global 21cm HI properties of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ (Lya) line of hydrogen is a well-known tracer of galaxies at high-z. However, the connection between Lya observables and galaxy properties has not fully been established, limiting the use of the line to probe the physics of galaxies. Here, we derive global neutral hydrogen gas (HI) properties of nearby Lya-emitting galaxies to assess the impact of HI on the Lya output of galaxies. We observed 21cm line emission using the VLA in D-array configuration (~55" resolution, ~38 kpc) for 37 star-forming galaxies with available Lya imaging from the Lyman Alpha Reference Samples (LARS and eLARS). We detect 21cm emission for 33/37 galaxies observed. We find no significant correlation of global HI properties with Lya luminosity, escape fraction or equivalent width derived with HST photometry. Additionally, both Lya-emitters and weak or non-emitters are distributed evenly along the HI parameter space of optically-selected z=0 galaxies. Around 74% of the sample is undergoing galaxy interaction, this fraction is higher for Lya-emitters (83% for galaxies with EW$\geq$20\r{A}) than for non or weak emitters (70%). Nevertheless, galaxies identified as interacting have Lya and HI properties statistically consistent with those of non-interacting galaxies. Our results show that global HI properties (on scales &gt; 30kpc) have little direct impact on the Lya output from galaxies. Instead, HI likely regulates Lya emission on small scales: statistical comparisons of Lya and high angular resolution 21cm observations are required to fully assess the role of HI in Lya radiative transfer. While our study indicates that galaxy mergers could play a role in the emission of Lya photons in the local universe, especially for galaxies with high HI fractions, the line-of-sight through which a system is observed ultimately determines Lya observables.</description>

      <title>Tripling the Census of Dwarf AGN Candidates Using DESI Early Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGN in 75,928/296,261 ($\approx$25.6%) high-mass ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) &gt;$ 9.5) and 2,444/114,496 ($\approx$2.1%) dwarf ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \leq$ 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad H$\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN as well as that of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH} \le 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $&lt; \log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) &lt;$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $&lt; \rm z &lt;$ 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the $M_{\rm BH}$ - $M_{\star}$ scaling relation down to $\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \approx$ 8.5 and $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \approx$ 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.</description>

      <title>The formation and stability of a cold disc made out of stellar winds in the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reported discovery of a cold ($\sim$10$^4~\text{K}$) disc-like structure around the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milk Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), has challenged our understanding of the gas dynamics and thermodynamic state of the plasma in its immediate vicinity. State-of-the-art simulations do not agree on whether or not such a disc can indeed be a product of the multiple stellar wind interactions of the mass-losing stars in the region. This study aims to constrain the conditions for the formation of a cold disc as a natural outcome of the system of the mass-losing stars orbiting around Sgr A*, to investigate if the disc is a transient or long-lasting structure, and to assess the validity of the model through direct comparisons with observations. We conduct a set of hydrodynamic simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars feeding Sgr A* using the finite-volume adaptive mesh-refinement code Ramses. We focus, for the first time, on the impact of the chemical composition of the plasma emanating from the WR stars. The simulations show that the chemical composition of the plasma affects the radiative cooling enough to impact the properties of the medium such as density and temperature and, as a consequence, the rate at which the material inflows onto Sgr A*. We demonstrated that the formation of a cold disc from the stellar winds is possible for certain chemical compositions that are consistent with the current observational constraints. However, even in such a case, it is not possible to reproduce the reported properties of the observed disc-like structure, namely its inclination and hydrogen recombination line fluxes. We conclude that the stellar winds on their own cannot form the cold disc around Sgr A* inferred from the observations. Either relevant ingredients are still missing in the model, or the interpretation of the observed data needs to be revised.</description>

      <title>High-velocity outflows persist up to 1 Gyr after a starburst in recently-quenched galaxies at z &gt; 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity outflows are ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon, but are not as common in passive galaxies at the same epoch. Using optical spectra of galaxies selected from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) at z &gt; 1, we perform a stacking analysis to investigate the transition in outflow properties along a quenching time sequence. To do this, we use MgII (2800 A) absorption profiles to investigate outflow properties as a function of time since the last major burst of star formation (tburst). We find evidence for high-velocity outflows in the star-forming progenitor population (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 210 km/s), for recently quenched galaxies with tburst &lt; 0.6 Gyr (vout ~ 990 $\pm$ 250 km/s), and for older quenched galaxies with 0.6 &lt; tburst &lt; 1 Gyr (vout ~ 1400 $\pm$ 220 km/s). The oldest galaxies (tburst &gt; 1 Gyr) show no evidence for significant outflows. Our samples show no signs of AGN in optical observations, suggesting that any AGN in these galaxies have very short duty cycles, and were 'off' when observed. The presence of significant outflows in the older quenched galaxies (tburst &gt; 0.6 Gyr) is difficult to explain with starburst activity, however, and may indicate energy input from episodic AGN activity as the starburst fades.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dynamos in galaxy clusters: the crucial role of galaxy formation physics at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission in galaxy clusters imply large-scale magnetic fields with $\mu\mathrm{G}$ strengths possibly extending back to $z=4$. Non-radiative cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters show a comparably slow magnetic field growth that only saturates at late times. We include galaxy formation physics and find a significantly accelerated magnetic field growth. We identify three crucial stages in the magnetic field evolution. 1) At high redshift, the central dominant galaxy serves as the prime agent that magnetizes not only its immediate vicinity but also most of the forming protocluster through a combination of a small-scale dynamo induced by gravitationally driven, compressive turbulence and stellar and active galactic nuclei feedback that distribute the magnetic field via outflows. 2) This process continues as other galaxies merge into the forming cluster in subsequent epochs, thereby transporting their previously amplified magnetic field to the intracluster medium (ICM) through ram pressure stripping and galactic winds. 3) At lower redshift, gas accretion and frequent cluster mergers trigger additional small-scale dynamo processes, thereby preventing the decay of the magnetic field and fostering the increase of the magnetic coherence scale. We show that the magnetic field observed today in the weakly collisional ICM is consistently amplified on collisional scales. Initially, this occurs in the collisional interstellar medium during protocluster assembly, and later in the ICM on the magnetic coherence scale, which always exceeds the particle mean free path, supporting the use of magneto-hydrodynamics for studying the cluster dynamo. We generate synthetic Faraday rotation measure observations of protoclusters, highlighting the potential for studying magnetic field growth during the onset of cluster formation at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Fine structure and kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas in the jet and disk around S255IR NIRS3 from high resolution ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the high-mass star-forming region S255IR, which harbors the $\sim$20 M$_\odot$ protostar NIRS3, where a disk-mediated accretion burst was recorded several years ago, with the angular resolution of $\sim$15 mas, which corresponds to $\sim$25 au and is almost an order of magnitude better than in the previous studies of this object. The observations were performed with ALMA at a wavelength of 0.9 mm in continuum and in several molecular lines. In the continuum we detected the central bright source (brightness temperature $\sim$850 K) elongated along the jet direction and two pairs of bright knots in the jet lobes. These pairs of knots imply a double ejection from NIRS3 with the time interval of $\sim$1.5 years. The orientation of the jet differs by $\sim$20$^\circ$ from that on larger scales, as mentioned also in some other recent works. The 0.9 mm continuum emission of the central source represents a mixture of the dust thermal emission and free-free emission of the ionized gas. Properties of the free-free emission are typical for hypercompact H II regions. In the continuum emission of the knots in the jet the free-free component apparently dominates. In the molecular lines a sub-Keplerian disk around NIRS3 about 400 au in diameter is observed. The absorption features in the molecular lines towards the central bright source may indicate an infall. The molecular line emission appears very inhomogeneous at small scales, which may indicate a small-scale clumpiness in the disk.</description>

      <title>Compact dust-obscured star-formation and the origin of the galaxy bimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last decade, studies about highly attenuated and massive red star-forming galaxies (RedSFGs) at $z \sim 4$ have suggested that they could constitute a crucial population for unraveling the mechanisms driving the transition from vigorous star formation to quiescence at high redshifts. Since such a transition seems to be linked to a morphological transformation, studying the morphological properties of these RedSFGs is essential to our understanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we are using JWST/NIRCam images from the CEERS survey to assemble a mass-complete sample of 188 massive galaxies at $z=3-4$, for which we perform resolved-SED fit. After classifying galaxies into typical blue SFGs (BlueSFGs), RedSFGs and quiescent galaxies (QGs), we compare the morphologies of each population in terms of stellar mass density, SFR density, sSFR, dust-attenuation and mass-weighted age. We find that RedSFGs and QGs present similar stellar surface density profiles and that RedSFGs manifest a dust attenuation concentration significantly higher than that of BlueSFGs at all masses. This indicates that to become quiescent, a BlueSFG must transit through a major compaction phase once it has become sufficiently massive. At the same time, we find RedSFGs and QGs to account for more than $50\%$ of galaxies with ${\rm log}(M_\ast/M_\odot)&gt; 10.4$ at this redshift. This transition mass corresponds to the "critical mass" delineating the bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs in the local Universe. We then conclude that there is a bimodality between extended BlueSFGs and compact, highly attenuated RedSFGs that have undergone a major gas compaction phase enabling the latter to build a massive bulb in situ. There is evidence that this early-stage separation is at the origin of the local bimodality between BlueSFGs and QGs, which we refer to as a "primeval bimodality".</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Perceptron for Predicting Galaxy Parameters (MLP-GaP): stellar masses and star formation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale imaging survey will produce massive photometric data in multi-bands for billions of galaxies. Defining strategies to quickly and efficiently extract useful physical information from this data is mandatory. Among the stellar population parameters for galaxies, their stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are the most fundamental. We develop a novel tool, \textit{Multi-Layer Perceptron for Predicting Galaxy Parameters} (MLP-GaP), that uses a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to accurately and efficiently derive the stellar masses and SFRs from multi-band catalogs. We first adopt a mock dataset generated by the \textit{Code Investigating GALaxy Emission} (CIGALE) for training and testing datasets. Subsequently, we used a multi-layer perceptron model to build MLP-GaP and effectively trained it with the training dataset. The results of the test performed on the mock dataset show that MLP-GaP can accurately predict the reference values. Besides MLP-GaP has a significantly faster processing speed than CIGALE. To demonstrate the science-readiness of the MLP-GaP, we also apply it to a real data sample and compare the stellar masses and SFRs with CIGALE. Overall, the predicted values of MLP-GaP show a very good consistency with the estimated values derived from SED fitting. Therefore, the capability of MLP-GaP to rapidly and accurately predict stellar masses and SFRs makes it particularly well-suited for analyzing huge amounts of galaxies in the era of large sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Full interferometric map of the L1157 southern outflow: Formamide (NH$_2$CHO) can form in the gas, after all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation mechanism of interstellar formamide (NH$_2$CHO), a key prebiotic precursor, is currently a matter of hot debate within the astrochemistry community, with both gas-phase and grain-surface chemical pathways having been proposed as its dominant formation route. The aim of the present study is to place firm observational constraints on the formation pathways leading to formamide thanks to new interferometric observations of the molecular outflow driven by the protostellar binary L1157. We employed the IRAM NOEMA interferometer to map the entire southern outflow of L1157, which contains three main shocked regions with increasing post-shock age: B0, B1, and B2. This allowed us to measure how the abundance of formamide, that of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and the ratio of the two, vary with time in this region. In order to gain a greater understanding of the most likely formation routes of formamide, we ran a grid of astrochemical models and compared these to our observations. A comparison between observations and astrochemical modelling indicates that there are two possible scenarios: one in which the amount of formamide observed can be explained by gas-phase-only chemistry, and more specifically via the reaction H$_2$CO + NH$_2$ $\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO + H$_2$, and another in which part of the observed formamide originates from surface chemistry and part from gas-phase chemistry. Surface chemistry alone cannot account for the abundance of formamide that we measure. While grain-surface chemistry cannot be ruled out, the present study brings definitive proof that gas-phase chemistry does work in L1157-B and acts efficiently in the production of this molecular species.</description>

      <title>Initial Mass Functions of Young Stellar Clusters from the Gemini Spectroscopic Survey of Nearby Galaxies I. Young Massive Clusters in the Antennae galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a key parameter to understand the star formation process and the integrated properties of stellar populations in remote galaxies. We present a spectroscopic study of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the starburst galaxies NGC 4038/39. The integrated spectra of seven YMCs obtained with GMOS-S attached to the 8.2-m Gemini South telescope reveal the spectral features associated with stellar ages and the underlying IMFs. We constrain the ages of the YMCs using the absorption lines and strong emission bands from Wolf-Rayet stars. The internal reddening is also estimated from the strength of the Na I D absorption lines. Based on these constraints, the observed spectra are matched with the synthetic spectra generated from a simple stellar population model. Several parameters of the clusters including age, reddening, cluster mass, and the underlying IMF are derived from the spectral matching. The ages of the YMCs range from 2.5 to 6.5 Myr, and these clusters contain stellar masses ranging from 1.6 X 10^5 M_sun to 7.9 X 10^7 M_sun. The underlying IMFs appear to differ from the universal form of the Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. Interestingly, massive clusters tend to have the bottom-heavy IMFs, although the masses of some clusters are overestimated due to the crowding effect. Based on this, our results suggest that the universal form of the IMF is not always valid when analyzing integrated light from unresolved stellar systems. However, further study with a larger sample size is required to reach a definite conclusion.</description>

      <title>Sulfur-bearing molecules in a sample of early star-forming cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sulfur content in dense molecular regions of the interstellar medium is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason of this phenomenon is unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages to uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense cores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and column densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum emission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The abundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas temperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to 100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly correlated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar chemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with oxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores. This work gives quantitative information about abundances that could be useful in chemical models pointing to explain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The Flattest Infrared Extinction Curve in Four Isolated Dense Molecular Cloud Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extinction curve of interstellar dust in the dense molecular cloud cores is crucial for understanding dust properties, particularly size distribution and composition. We investigate the infrared extinction law in four nearby isolated molecular cloud cores, L429, L483, L673, and L1165, across the 1.2 - 8.0 $\mu$m wavelength range, using deep near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data from UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\sim$ 40-60 mag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios $E(K-\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\lambda)$ versus $(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat infrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most pronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is consistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain growth in dense environments. Intriguingly, our findings align closely with the Astrodust model for a diffuse interstellar environment proposed by Hensley \&amp; Draine. This agreement between dense core observations and a diffuse medium model highlights the complexity of dust evolution and the need for further investigation into the processes governing dust properties in different interstellar environments.</description>

      <title>In-situ formation of star clusters at z &gt; 7 via galactic disk fragmentation; shedding light on ultra-compact clusters and overmassive black holes seen by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of star formation in gas-rich galaxies at $z &gt; 7$ forming in a markedly overdense region, in the whereabouts of a massive virialized halo already exceeding $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find that not only the primary galaxy, but also the lower-mass companion galaxies rapidly develop massive self-gravitating compact gas disks, less than 500~pc in size, which undergo fragmentation by gravitational instability into very massive bound clumps. Star formation proceeds fast in the clumps, which quickly turn into compact star clusters with masses in the range $10^5$-$10^8$ M$_{\odot}$ and typical half-mass radii of a few pc, reaching characteristic densities above $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. The properties of the clusters in the lowest-mass galaxy bear a striking resemblance to those recently discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the lensed Cosmic Gems arc system at $z = 10.2$. We argue that, due to their extremely high stellar densities, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) would form rapidly inside the clusters, which would then swiftly sink and merge on their way to the galactic nucleus, easily growing a $10^7$~M$_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Due to the high fractional mass contribution of clusters to the stellar mass of the galaxies, in the range $20$-$40\%$, the central SMBH would comprise more than $10\%$ of the mass of its host galaxy, naturally explaining the overmassive SMBHs discovered by JWST at $z &gt; 6$.</description>

      <title>A generative model for Gaia astrometric orbit catalogs: selection functions for binary stars, giant planets, and compact object companions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.</description>

      <title>The baryon census and the mass-density of stars, neutral gas, and hot gas as a function of halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stellar, neutral gas content within halos over a halo mass range $10^{10} \text{ to } 10^{15.5} \text{M}_\odot$ and hot X-ray gas content over a halo mass range $10^{12.8} \text{ to } 10^{15.5} \text{M}_\odot$ in the local universe. We combine various empirical datasets of stellar, \HI\ and X-ray observations of galaxies, groups and clusters to establish fundamental baryonic mass vs halo mass scaling relations. These scaling relations are combined with halo mass function to obtain the baryon densities of stars, neutral gas and hot gas ($T&gt;10^6 \text{K}$), as a function of halo mass. We calculate the contributions of the individual baryonic components to the cosmic baryon fraction. Cosmic stellar mass density ($\Omega_\text{star}=2.09^{+0.21}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-3}$), cosmic HI mass density ($\Omega_\text{HI}=0.49^{+0.25}_{-0.12} \times 10^{-3}$) and cosmic neutral gas mass density ($\Omega_\text{neutral gas}=0.71^{+0.39}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-3}$) estimates are consistent with previous more direct method measurements of these values, thereby establishing the veracity of our method. We also give an estimate of the cosmic hot plasma density ($\Omega_\text{hot gas}=2.58^{+2.1}_{-0.66} \times 10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>A Fast, Analytic Empirical Model of the Gaia Data Release 3 Astrometric Orbit Catalog Selection Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe &amp; Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 &lt; P_{orb} &lt; 2000$ days.</description>

      <title>Scales of Stability and Turbulence in the Molecular ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10979v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-analyze the data of the BU-FCRAO $^{13}{\rm CO}$ Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) to understand the dynamics of the turbulent molecular interstellar medium. We define molecular clouds by their spatial half-power contours of $^{13}{\rm CO}$ integrated intensity, independent of a boundary based on thresholding or tiling. We find properties of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE), the former independent and the latter dependent on time and spatial scales. We suggest that HE is a stationary property of the turbulence and that molecular clouds are high-density regions of a fluctuating component. The gravitational and turbulent kinetic energies within clouds are continuously evolving toward a time-dependent VE with the fluctuating, external, turbulent pressure energy (PE) that can be treated parametrically owing to the shorter time scale for virialization. The average PE is comparable to the pressure of the multiphase ISM at the Galactic mid-plane. Larson's scaling relations analyzed by different statistical methods are not significant. The non-dimensional variances of size, line width, and column density are of comparable magnitude, ruling out the inference of constant column density. Previously unrecognized autocorrelations may have contributed to the apparent validity of the inference.</description>

      <title>Improved particle spray algorithm for modeling globular cluster streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams that emerge from globular clusters (GCs) are thin stellar structures spread along the orbits of progenitor clusters. Numerical modeling of these streams is essential for understanding their interaction with the host galaxy's mass distribution. Traditional methods are either computationally expensive or oversimplified, motivating us to develop a fast and accurate approach using a particle spray algorithm. By conducting a series of N-body simulations of GCs orbiting a host galaxy, we find that the position and velocity distributions of newly-escaped stream particles are consistent across various GC masses and orbital parameters. Based on these distributions, we develop a new algorithm that avoids computing the detailed internal cluster dynamics by directly drawing tracer particles from these distributions. This algorithm correctly reproduces the action space distribution of stream particles and achieves a 10% accuracy in stream morphology and velocities compared to N-body simulations. To facilitate broader use, we have implemented this algorithm in galactic dynamics codes agama, gala, galax, and galpy.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within some theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters (GCs) can be determined by calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of GCs within Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, beyond Horndeski gravity (BHG), and modified emergent Newtonian gravity (MENG) with generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) correction. We apply the formulations on the masses of 10 GCs. We compare our results with the Newtonian mass of GCs. Within a regime, we get an insight that all formulations could match the Newtonian mass. Thus, the impact of the modified theories of gravity used in this work can be neglected in this regime. The noteworthy impact starts if we set $\kappa=5\times10^{40}$ for EiBI theory, $\Upsilon=-0.1655\times10^{69}$ for BHG, and $\beta_0=-1.656\times10^{110}$ for MENG. {We also compare our results from EiBI theory and BHG with the baryonic masses $M_{bar}$ of the GCs. A better linear fit is achieved by EiBI theory with $\kappa_0=5.80\times10^{40}$, which gives the slope $\mathcal{M}$ of $0.126\pm0.086$. This value is closer to unity than the one of BHG. This leads us to the fact that EiBI theory is more effective than BHG in alleviating the mass discrepancy between hydrostatic mass and baryonic mass in GCs. Nevertheless, neither EiBI theory nor BHG completely addresses the mass discrepancy problem.}</description>

      <title>Disruption of a massive molecular cloud by a supernova in the Galactic Centre: Initial results from the ACES project</title>

Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar). Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79" and 154", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $&gt; 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($&gt; 10^{51}$ erg) and momentum ($&gt; 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>A census of dwarf galaxy satellites around LMC-mass galaxy NGC 2403</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive census of the satellite population around a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) stellar-mass galaxy, as part of the Magellanic Analog Dwarf Companions and Stellar Halos (MADCASH) survey. We have surveyed NGC 2403 (D=3.0 Mpc) with the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam imager out to a projected radius of 90 kpc (with partial coverage extending out to ~110 kpc, or ~80% of the virial radius of NGC 2403), resolving stars in the uppermost ~2.5 mags of its red giant branch. By looking for stellar overdensities in the red giant branch spatial density map, we identify 149 satellite candidates, of which only the previously discovered MADCASH J074238+65201-dw is a bona fide dwarf, together with the more massive and disrupting satellite DDO 44. We carefully assess the completeness of our search via injection of artificial dwarf galaxies into the images, finding that we are reliably sensitive to candidates down to M_V ~ -7.5 mag (and somewhat sensitive to even fainter satellites). A comparison of the satellite luminosity function of NGC 2403 down to this magnitude limit to theoretical expectations shows overall good agreement. This is the first of a full sample of 11 Magellanic Cloud-mass host galaxies we will analyze, creating a statistical sample that will provide the first quantitative constraints on hierarchical models of galaxy formation around low-mass hosts.</description>

      <title>Stellar stripping efficiencies of satellites in numerical simulations: the effect of resolution, satellite properties and numerical disruption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar stripping of satellites in cluster haloes is understood to play an important role in the production of intracluster light. Increasingly, cosmological simulations have been utilised to investigate its origin and assembly. However, such simulations typically model individual galaxies at relatively coarse resolutions, raising concerns about their accuracy. Although there is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the accurate recovery of the mass loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has been no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates in galaxy clusters.
  Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo represented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence tests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening length on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital configurations, satellite masses and satellite morphologies. We find that stellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution. Resolving the central regions of satellite DM halos is critical to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner profiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of the satellite galaxy, this leads to significant over-stripping. To prevent this, relatively high DM mass resolutions of around $m_{\rm DM}\sim10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, better than those achieved by many contemporary cosmological simulations, are necessary.</description>

Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>North Polar Spur: gaseous plume(s) from star-forming regions at $\sim$3-5 kpc from Galactic Center?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00752</link>

Abstract: We argue that the North Polar Spur (NPS) and many less prominent structures are formed by gaseous metal-rich plumes associated with star-forming regions (SFRs). The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5~kpc rings might be particularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components and cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial momentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of the ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in the disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc model of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the morphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>
