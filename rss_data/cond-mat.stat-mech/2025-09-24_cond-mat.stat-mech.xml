      <title>Nonlinear Response Relations and Fluctuation-Response Inequalities for Nonequilibrium Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting how systems respond to external perturbations far from equilibrium remains a fundamental challenge across physics, chemistry, and biology. We present a unified response framework for stochastic Markov dynamics that integrates linear and nonlinear perturbations. Our formalism expresses nonlinear responses of observables in terms of the covariance between the observable and a nonlinear conjugate variable. The nonlinear conjugate variable is subject to the complete Bell polynomial form and is determined by the stochastic entropy production. In addition, the Fluctuation-Response Inequalities (FRIs) are also derived for nonlinear responses, unraveling the general trade-off relations between nonlinear response and systems' fluctuations far from equilibrium. The validity of our theory is verified by the numerical results from a symmetric exclusion process (SEP). By unifying and extending nonequilibrium linear response theories, our approach can provide principled design rules for sensitive, adaptive synthetic and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of timescales in a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</description>

      <title>Efficient Microcanonical Histogram Analysis and Application to Peptide Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach designed to directly estimate microcanonical quantities from energy histograms is proposed, which enables the immediate systematic identification and classification of phase transitions in physical systems of any size by means of the recently introduced generalized microcanonical inflection-point analysis method. The application to the aggregation problem of GNNQQNY heptapeptides, for which the entire transition sequence is revealed, shows the power of this promising method.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits in interacting particle systems with symmetric superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the exchange-driven growth (EDG) equations as the mean-field limit of interacting particle systems on the complete graph. Extending previous work, we consider symmetric exchange kernels $c(k, l) = c(l, k)$ satisfying super-linear bounds of the form $c(k, l) \leq C(k^{\mu}l^{\nu} + k^{\nu}l^{\mu})$, with $0 \leq \mu, \nu \leq 2$ and $\mu + \nu \leq 3$. Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.</description>

      <title>Robustness and resilience of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are ubiquitous: a cell, the human brain, a group of people and the Internet are all examples of interconnected many-body systems characterized by macroscopic properties that cannot be trivially deduced from those of their microscopic constituents. Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative description of the surface tension minimum in a two-component surfactant system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gibbs adsorption equation is the thermodynamic cornerstone for the description and understanding of the surface tension in a surfactant solution. It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.</description>

      <title>Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.</description>

      <title>Superfluid-Mott transition in a frustrated triangular optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantitative relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$ of a tagged particle in a liquid and the entropy $S$ of that liquid has long been sought, as it would allow entropy to be inferred directly from diffusion measurements and transport properties to be predicted from thermodynamic information. Here, we employ extensive computer simulations to independently compute both $D$ and $S$ for Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquids and for water across a wide range of thermodynamic state points. Our study covers two and three dimensions for both systems, and additionally explores one-dimensional confinement for water. We find that the ratio of diffusion coefficients between two states follows an almost perfect exponential dependence on their entropy difference. For LJ liquids, the exponential prefactor exhibits a pronounced dependence on dimensionality $d$, consistent in trend but quantitatively distinct from theoretical predictions. In contrast, water shows a strikingly weak dimensionality $d$ dependence, deviating from theory, which we attribute to the dominant role of jump diffusion. Remarkably, the exponential diffusion-entropy relationship persists even when translational and rotational contributions to entropy are separated and considered individually. This robustness suggests that entropy provides a unifying measure governing particle mobility in liquids, largely independent of microscopic mechanisms or dimensional constraints.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range \( 0 &lt; H &lt; 1 \). Here we extend this definition to the regime \( -1/2 &lt; H &lt; 0 \). The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The resulting process is both very rough and persistent, that is long-range positively correlated. In addition, this process is stationary. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also study another closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range \( -1/2 &lt; H &lt; 0 \) and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for \( -1/2 &lt; H &lt; 0 \). In the marginal case \( H = 0 \), our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Temperature Order but no Antiferromagnetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J&gt;0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74&lt;a&lt;2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a&gt;2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a&gt;2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a &gt; 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J&lt;0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Relaxation via Temporary Reset: A Mpemba-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slow relaxation processes spanning widely separated timescales pose fundamental challenges for probing steady-state properties and engineering functional quantum systems, such as quantum heat engines and quantum computing devices. We introduce a protocol that enables significant acceleration of relaxation in general Markovian open quantum systems by temporarily coupling the system to a reset channel, inspired by the Mpemba effect. Crucially, this acceleration persists even when the slowest decaying Lindbladian modes form complex-conjugate pairs. Unlike previous approaches, which typically target a single mode, our protocol may suppress multiple relaxation modes simultaneously. This framework provides a versatile and experimentally feasible tool for controlling relaxation timescales, with broad implications for quantum thermodynamics, computation, and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Potential renormalisation, Lamb shift and mean-force Gibbs state -- to shift or not to shift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Often, the microscopic interaction mechanism of an open quantum system gives rise to a `counter term' which renormalises the system Hamiltonian. Such term compensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite coupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is, in general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a number of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when dealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can yield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate the dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is guaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature limit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show that, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter term does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the coupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the Lamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter term -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in practice. We thus provide precise conditions under which the open-system folklore regarding Lamb shift and counter terms is rigorously justified.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entanglement Enhances Magic Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We address this by analyzing a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup, where we show that entanglement acts as a conduit that teleports magic across the system, thereby enhancing magic injection. Using exact calculations, we prove that when a Haar-random unitary $U_A$ is applied to a subsystem $A$ of an entangled stabilizer state, the total injected magic increases with the entanglement between $A$ and its complement. More generally, for any unitary $U_A$, we show that this enhancement is maximized when $A$ is maximally entangled with its complement, in which case the total injected magic is exactly given by the unitary stabilizer R\'enyi entropy we introduce. This quantity provides both a directly computable measure of unitary magic and a lower bound on the minimum number of $T$ gates required to synthesize $U_A$. We further extend our analysis to tripartite stabilizer entanglement, non-stabilizer entanglement, and magic injection via shallow-depth brickwork circuits, finding that the qualitative picture remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Graph theory and tunable slow dynamics in quantum East Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how graph theory concepts can provide an insight into the origin of slow dynamics in systems with kinetic constraints. In particular, we observe that slow dynamics is related to the presence of strong hierarchies between nodes on the Fock-space graph in the particle occupation basis, which encodes configurations connected by a given Hamiltonian. To quantify hierarchical structures, we develop a measure of centrality of the nodes, which is applicable to generic Hamiltonian matrices and inspired by established centrality measures from graph theory. We illustrate these ideas in the quantum East (QE) model. We introduce several ways of detuning nodes in the corresponding graph that alter the hierarchical structure, defining a family of QE models. We numerically demonstrate how these detunings affect the degree of non-ergodicity on finite systems, as evidenced by both the time dependence of density autocorrelations and eigenstate properties in the detuned QE models.</description>

      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.</description>

      <title>Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
  We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</description>
