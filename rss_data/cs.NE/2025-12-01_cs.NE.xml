      <title>Privacy-preserving fall detection at the edge using Sony IMX636 event-based vision sensor and Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fall detection for elderly care using non-invasive vision-based systems remains an important yet unsolved problem. Driven by strict privacy requirements, inference must run at the edge of the vision sensor, demanding robust, real-time, and always-on perception under tight hardware constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a neuromorphic fall detection system that integrates the Sony IMX636 event-based vision sensor with the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor via a dedicated FPGA-based interface, leveraging the sparsity of event data together with near-memory asynchronous processing. Using a newly recorded dataset under diverse environmental conditions, we explore the design space of sparse neural networks deployable on a single Loihi 2 chip and analyze the tradeoffs between detection F1 score and computational cost. Notably, on the Pareto front, our LIF-based convolutional SNN with graded spikes achieves the highest computational efficiency, reaching a 55x synaptic operations sparsity for an F1 score of 58%. The LIF with graded spikes shows a gain of 6% in F1 score with 5x less operations compared to binary spikes. Furthermore, our MCUNet feature extractor with patched inference, combined with the S4D state space model, achieves the highest F1 score of 84% with a synaptic operations sparsity of 2x and a total power consumption of 90 mW on Loihi 2. Overall, our smart security camera proof-of-concept highlights the potential of integrating neuromorphic sensing and processing for edge AI applications where latency, energy consumption, and privacy are critical.</description>

      <title>Functional Program Synthesis with Higher-Order Functions and Recursion Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the process of generating a computer program following a set of specifications, such as a set of input-output examples. It can be modeled as a search problem in which the search space is the set of all valid programs. As the search space is vast, brute force is usually not feasible, and search heuristics, such as genetic programming, also have difficulty navigating it without guidance. This text presents 2 novel GP algorithms that synthesize pure, typed, and functional programs: HOTGP and Origami. HOTGP uses strong types and a functional grammar, synthesizing Haskell code, with support for higher-order functions, $\lambda$-functions, and parametric polymorphism. Experimental results show that HOTGP is competitive with the state of the art. Additionally, Origami is an algorithm that tackles the challenge of effectively handling loops and recursion by exploring Recursion Schemes, in which the programs are composed of well-defined templates with only a few parts that need to be synthesized. The first implementation of Origami can synthesize solutions in several Recursion Schemes and data structures, being competitive with other GP methods in the literature, as well as LLMs. The latest version of Origami employs a novel procedure, called AC/DC, designed to improve the search-space exploration. It achieves considerable improvement over its previous version by raising success rates on every problem. Compared to similar methods in the literature, it has the highest count of problems solved with success rates of $100\%$, $\geq 75\%$, and $\geq 25\%$ across all benchmarks. In $18\%$ of all benchmark problems, it stands as the only method to reach $100\%$ success rate, being the first known approach to achieve it on any problem in PSB2. It also demonstrates competitive performance to LLMs, achieving the highest overall win-rate against Copilot among all GP methods.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation Without Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.</description>

      <title>Prediction performance of random reservoirs with different topology for nonlinear dynamical systems with different number of degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful framework for predicting nonlinear dynamical systems, yet the role of reservoir topology$-$particularly symmetry in connectivity and weights$-$remains not adequately understood. This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Neural Networks: From Layered Architectures to Graph-Organized Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (&gt;3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Concentration at the Edge of Stability: Information Geometry of Kernel Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a "Ridge of Optimization" characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to "Spectral Concentration," its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the "Edge of Stability," a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Event Stream-based Sign Language Translation: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and A Novel Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability. Traditional SLT methods are typically based on visible light videos, which are easily affected by factors such as lighting variations, rapid hand movements, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes the use of bio-inspired event cameras to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we introduce a new high-definition event-based sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively addresses the data scarcity in this research area. The dataset comprises 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, covering multiple viewpoints, lighting conditions, and camera motions. We have also benchmarked existing mainstream SLT methods on this dataset to facilitate fair comparisons in future research.Furthermore, we propose a novel event-based sign language translation framework, termed EvSLT. The framework first segments continuous video features into clips and employs a Mamba-based memory aggregation module to compress and aggregate spatial detail features at the clip level. Subsequently, these spatial features, along with temporal representations obtained from temporal convolution, are then fused by a graph-guided spatiotemporal fusion module. Extensive experiments on Event-CSL, as well as other publicly available datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL</description>

      <title>Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods such as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) can substantially increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, but the principles governing their performance and stability remain largely uncharacterized. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis shows that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes under typical operating conditions, suggesting that this behavior is a general property of kernel regression methods, although KRR is computationally much faster. We identify a non-trivial, scale-dependent law for the kernel width $\gamma$, demonstrating that optimal capacity requires $\gamma$ to be scaled such that $\gamma N$ increases with network size $N$. This finding implies that larger networks require more localized kernels, in which each pattern's influence is more spatially confined, to mitigate inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide clear evidence that storage capacity scales linearly with network size~($P \propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust with respect to the choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Collectively, these findings provide a concise set of empirical principles for designing high-capacity and robust associative memories and clarify the mechanisms that enable kernel methods to overcome the classical limitations of Hopfield-type models.</description>

      <title>$\mu$PC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". By analysing the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results serve as a first step towards scaling PC to more complex architectures and have implications for other local algorithms. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Training of Recursive Reasoning Models with Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

      <title>Self-Organization and Spectral Mechanism of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13053v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.</description>
