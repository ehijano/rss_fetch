      <title>Hydrodynamic Modeling Improvements for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines with Validation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents key enhancements in hydrodynamic modeling using the strip-based Morison's equation approach to enable rapid simulations of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWT). The modeling framework employs the relative form of the Morison equation, incorporating nonlinear irregular wave kinematics, vertical wave stretching, and diffraction corrections based on MacCamy-Fuchs (MCF) theory for large-scale, non-slender structures. Wave kinematics are iteratively applied at dynamically displaced structural nodes to accurately capture fluid-structure interaction. Additionally, a discretization scheme is introduced to improve hydrodynamic load distribution across large horizontal structures of floaters. These enhancements are validated against experimental data from the Floating Offshore Wind and Controls Advanced Laboratory (FOCAL), which conducted a 1:70 scale test of the IEA-Wind 15MW reference turbine on the VolturnUS-S platform. Results demonstrate that the incorporation of nonlinear wave kinematics significantly improves low-frequency response accuracy. Furthermore, the vertical wave stretching and MCF corrections lead to surge response predictions that closely align with experimental measurements, while the improved load discretization significantly enhances heave and pitch response fidelity in wave-dominant frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>NICE^k Metrics: Unified and Multidimensional Framework for Evaluating Deterministic Solar Forecasting Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate solar energy output prediction is key for integrating renewables into grids, maintaining stability, and improving energy management. However, standard error metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Skill Scores (SS) fail to capture the multidimensional nature of solar irradiance forecasting. These metrics lack sensitivity to forecastability, rely on arbitrary baselines (e.g., clear-sky models), and are poorly suited for operational use.
  To address this, we introduce the NICEk framework (Normalized Informed Comparison of Errors, with k = 1, 2, 3, Sigma), offering a robust and interpretable evaluation of forecasting models. Each NICEk score corresponds to an Lk norm: NICE1 targets average errors, NICE2 emphasizes large deviations, NICE3 highlights outliers, and NICESigma combines all.
  Using Monte Carlo simulations and data from 68 stations in the Spanish SIAR network, we evaluated methods including autoregressive models, extreme learning, and smart persistence. Theoretical and empirical results align when assumptions hold (e.g., R^2 ~ 1.0 for NICE2). Most importantly, NICESigma consistently shows higher discriminative power (p &lt; 0.05), outperforming traditional metrics (p &gt; 0.05).
  The NICEk metrics exhibit stronger statistical significance (e.g., p-values from 10^-6 to 0.004 across horizons) and greater generalizability. They offer a unified and operational alternative to standard error metrics in deterministic solar forecasting.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory approach to describe ice crystals habit evolution in ice clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice clouds, particularly cirrus clouds, significantly influence Earth's radiative balance but remain poorly characterized in current climate models. A major uncertainty arises from the variability of their microphysical properties, especially the evolution of ice crystal habits under depositional growth. We propose a heuristic method to describe habit evolution based on four fundamental shapes identified in the literature and from in situ observations: droxtals, plates, columns, and rosettes. These represent the primary forms that are relevant under depositional growth, excluding aggregation. In this study, we employ a non-Abelian gauge theory within a field-theoretical framework, imposing an SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) symmetry on the fields associated with each habit probability growth. This symmetry enables the derivation of a modified system of coupled Fokker-Planck equations, capturing the stochastic growth dynamics of ice crystals while incorporating phenomenological mutual influences among habits. This framework outlines a novel theoretical direction for integrating symmetry principles and field-theoretical tools into the modelling of habit dynamics in ice clouds.</description>

      <title>Land Cover Changes Cause Increased Losses during Photosynthetic Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use and land cover (LULCC), are a key contributor to climate change. As the climate warms, extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires have become more frequent and are projected to intensify throughout the 21st century. These escalating extremes are likely to further disrupt vegetation productivity, known as gross primary production (GPP), and reduce the ecosystem's capacity to absorb carbon. In this study, we employ a global Earth system model to assess how (a) CO2 emissions alone and (b) CO2 combined with LULCC influence the severity, frequency, and duration of GPP extremes. Our results show that negative GPP extremes periods of unexpectedly low carbon uptake are increasing more rapidly than positive extremes, especially under LULCC scenarios. The primary climate factor driving these extremes is soil moisture variability, which is influenced by fluctuations in both precipitation and temperature. The delayed responses of GPP to different climate drivers depend on the specific driver and geographical region. Overall, the highest incidence of GPP extremes arises from the combined influence of water stress, temperature anomalies, and fire-related disturbances.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert in Cloud Physics: a Graph-Based Analysis of Learner Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how learners conceptualize complex scientific systems remains a key challenge in geoscience education. We investigate the evolution of conceptual understanding of cloud physics among 153 learners, ranging from bachelor's students to disciplinary experts and representing diverse academic backgrounds across STEM. To do so, we trace how knowledge structures evolve over time using metrics from a quasi-longitudinal network analysis. The analysis characterizes the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the epistemological shift that learners experience as they mature in their understanding of the discipline. We show that in their description of the life-cycle of a cloud, they progressively transition from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed descriptions of cloud microphysical processes. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts complements and confirms the analysis. The results can assist lecturers in structuring their teaching towards higher levels of understanding, and enable students to anticipate the key complexities and conceptual challenges in the field during their learning process. Furthermore, the generic nature of the analysis can be transferred to a wide range of disciplines.</description>
