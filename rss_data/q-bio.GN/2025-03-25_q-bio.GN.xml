      <title>Application of Single-cell Deep Learning in Elucidating the Mapping Relationship Between Visceral and Body Surface Inflammatory Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a system of integrated homeostasis, life is susceptible to disruptions by visceral inflammation, which can disturb internal environment equilibrium. The role of body-spread subcutaneous fascia (scFascia) in this process is poorly understood. In the rat model of Salmonella-induced dysentery, scRNA-seq of scFascia and deep-learning analysis revealed Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming in macrophages (MPs) with reduced citrate cycle activity. Cd34+/Pdgfra+ telocytes (CPTCs) regulated MPs differentiation and proliferation via Wnt/Fgf signal, suggesting a pathological crosstalk pattern in the scFascia, herein termed the fascia-visceral inflammatory crosstalk pattern (FVICP). PySCENIC analysis indicated increased activity transcription factors Fosl1, Nfkb2, and Atf4, modulated by CPTCs signaling to MPs, downregulating aerobic respiration and upregulating cell cycle, DNA replication, and transcription. This study highlights scFascia's role in immunomodulation and metabolic reprogramming during visceral inflammation, underscoring its function in systemic homeostasis.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Approach to Variant Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate variant descriptions are of paramount importance in the field of genetics. The domain is confronted with increasingly complex variants, making it more challenging to generate proper variant descriptions. We present a graph based on all minimal alignments that is a complete representation of a variant and we provide three complementary extraction methods to derive variant descriptions from this graph. Our experiments show that our method in comparison with dbSNP results in identical HGVS descriptions for simple variants and more meaningful descriptions for complex variants.</description>

      <title>Combining multiplexed functional data to improve variant classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the surge in the number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) reported in ClinVar in recent years, there is an imperative to resolve VUS at scale. Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which allow the functional consequence of 100s to 1000s of genetic variants to be measured in a single experiment, are emerging as a source of evidence which can be used for clinical gene variant classification. Increasingly, there are multiple published MAVEs for the same gene, sometimes measuring different aspects of variant impact. Where multiple functional consequences may need to be considered to get a more complete understanding of variant effects for a given gene, combining data from multiple MAVEs may lead to the assignment of increased evidence strength which could impact variant classifications. Here, we provide guidance for combining such multiplexed functional data, incorporating a stepwise process from data curation and collection to model generation and validation. We illustrate the potential of this approach by showing the integration of multiplexed functional data from four MAVEs for the gene TP53. By following these steps, researchers can maximize the value of MAVEs, strengthen the functional evidence for clinical variant classification, reclassify more VUS, and potentially uncover novel mechanisms of pathogenicity for clinically relevant genes.</description>
