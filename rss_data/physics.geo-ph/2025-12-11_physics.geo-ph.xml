      <title>On the Frechet Root Kernel of Certain Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the adjoint method to complex-valued PDEs and introduce the Fr\'echet root sensitivity kernel, as the most fundamental kernel from which all other material-sensitivity kernels can be derived. We apply this framework to four representative equations: two real-valued PDEs (the second-order wave equation and the Euler--Bernoulli beam equation) and two complex-valued PDEs (the complex transport equation and the Schroedinger equation with zero potential). We compute and analyze the Frechet root kernels for all four PDEs and show that, for constant material parameters, the kernel exhibits a consistent structure across systems, while its instantaneous form propagates as a wave whose shape depends on the initial conditions. For the Schroedinger equation, we find an especially notable result: the integrand of the Frechet root kernel coincides with the Born rule of quantum mechanics, suggesting that the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction may arise naturally from a general sensitivity-analysis framework rather than from an independent postulate. Our results establish a unified approach to sensitivity analysis for real- and complex-valued PDEs, provide a new perspective on the origin of the Born rule.</description>

      <title>The Complex-Step Integral Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the well-established connection between the Hilbert transform and derivative operators, and motivated by recent developments in complex-step differentiation, we introduce the Complex-Step Integral Transform (CSIT): a generalized integral transform that combines analytic continuation, derivative approximation, and multi-scale smoothing within a unified framework. A spectral analysis shows that the CSIT preserves phase while suppressing high-wavenumber noise, offering advantages over conventional Fourier derivatives. We discuss the roles of the real and imaginary step parameters, compare FFT-based and interpolation-based implementations, and demonstrate the method on the advection equation and instantaneous-frequency computation. Results show that the CSIT yields smoother, more robust attributes than Hilbert-based methods and provides built-in stabilization for PDE solvers. The CSIT thus represents a flexible alternative for numerical differentiation, spectral analysis, and seismic signal processing. The method opens several avenues for future work, including non-periodic implementations, adaptive parameter selection, and integration with local interpolation frameworks such as high-order Finite-Element methods.</description>

      <title>Seeing Soil from Space: Towards Robust and Scalable Remote Soil Nutrient Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental variables are increasingly affecting agricultural decision-making, yet accessible and scalable tools for soil assessment remain limited. This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.</description>

      <title>The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1\% to 150\% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities, reducing local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 18 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim 10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H y$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of data- and image- domain LSRTM under velocity-impedance parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches, thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic impedance is found to work well. These observations have been further validated on Viking Graben Line 12 dataset.</description>
