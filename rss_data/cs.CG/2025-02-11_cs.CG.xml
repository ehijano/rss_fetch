      <title>Validity-first automatic polycube labeling for CAD models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many simulation codes, block-structured hex meshes remain preferred while their automatic generation is unsolved. We investigate the usage of a polycube-based approach. More specifically, we focus on the labeling stage, which consists in assigning each boundary facet to one of the 6 signed principal axis. Similar works are confronted with 2 challenges: over-constraining validity criteria, and the conflated processing of validity criteria with quality metrics. We tackle these obstacles with automatic routines based on semi-global labeling operators. Our approach is successfully tested on CAD models, which are of interest for many numerical simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Geometry with AI: Multi-agent Generation of Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polytopes are one of the most primitive concepts underlying geometry. Discovery and study of polytopes with complex structures provides a means of advancing scientific knowledge. Construction of polytopes with specific extremal structure is very difficult and time-consuming. Having an automated tool for the generation of such extremal examples is therefore of great value. We present an Artificial Intelligence system capable of generating novel polytopes with very high complexity, whose abilities we demonstrate in three different and challenging scenarios: the Hirsch Conjecture, the k-neighbourly problem and the longest monotone paths problem. For each of these three problems the system was able to generate novel examples, which match or surpass the best previously known bounds. Our main focus was the Hirsch Conjecture, which had remained an open problem for over 50 years. The highly parallel A.I. system presented in this paper was able to generate millions of examples, with many of them surpassing best known previous results and possessing properties not present in the earlier human-constructed examples. For comparison, it took leading human experts over 50 years to handcraft the first example of a polytope exceeding the bound conjectured by Hirsch, and in the decade since humans were able to construct only a scarce few families of such counterexample polytopes. With the adoption of computer-aided methods, the creation of new examples of mathematical objects stops being a domain reserved only for human expertise. Advances in A.I. provide mathematicians with yet another powerful tool in advancing mathematical knowledge. The results presented demonstrate that A.I. is capable of addressing problems in geometry recognized as extremely hard, and also to produce extremal examples different in nature from the ones constructed by humans.</description>

      <title>Scalable k-Means Clustering for Large k via Seeded Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For very large values of $k$, we consider methods for fast $k$-means clustering of massive datasets with $10^7\sim10^9$ points in high-dimensions ($d\geq100$). All current practical methods for this problem have runtimes at least $\Omega(k^2)$. We find that initialization routines are not a bottleneck for this case. Instead, it is critical to improve the speed of Lloyd's local-search algorithm, particularly the step that reassigns points to their closest center. Attempting to improve this step naturally leads us to leverage approximate nearest-neighbor search methods, although this alone is not enough to be practical. Instead, we propose a family of problems we call "Seeded Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search", for which we propose "Seeded Search-Graph" methods as a solution.</description>

      <title>Physically-Based Mesh Generation for Confined 3D Point Clouds Using Flexible Foil Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing high-quality, closed-surface meshes from confined 3D point clouds via a physically-based simulation of flexible foils under spatial constraints. The approach integrates dynamic elasticity, pressure-driven deformation, and adaptive snapping to fixed vertices, providing a robust framework for realistic and physically accurate mesh creation. Applications in computer graphics and computational geometry are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Price of Upwardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Not every directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is planar admits an upward planar drawing. We are interested in pushing the notion of upward drawings beyond planarity by considering upward $k$-planar drawings of DAGs in which the edges are monotonically increasing in a common direction and every edge is crossed at most $k$ times for some integer $k \ge 1$. We show that the number of crossings per edge in a monotone drawing is in general unbounded for the class of bipartite outerplanar, cubic, or bounded pathwidth DAGs. However, it is at most two for outerpaths and it is at most quadratic in the bandwidth in general. From the computational point of view, we prove that upward-$k$-planarity testing is NP-complete already for $k =1$ and even for restricted instances for which upward planarity testing is polynomial. On the positive side, we can decide in linear time whether a single-source DAG admits an upward $1$-planar drawing in which all vertices are incident to the outer face.</description>

      <title>A Unified FPT Framework for Crossing Number Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basic (and traditional) crossing number problem is to determine the minimum number of crossings in a topological drawing of an input graph in the plane. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that yields fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for many generalized crossing number problems in the plane and on surfaces.
  Our main result takes the following form. We fix a surface S, an integer r, and a map \kappa from the set of topological drawings of graphs in S to the nonnegative integers, essentially describing which types of drawings we accept and how we want to count the crossings in them. Then deciding whether a graph G has a drawing D on S with \kappa(D)&lt;=r can be done in time quadratic in the size of G. More generally, we may take as input an edge-colored graph, and distinguish crossings by the colors of the involved edges; and we may allow to perform a bounded number of edge removals and vertex splits to G before drawing it. The proof is a reduction to the embeddability of a graph on a two-dimensional simplicial complex, which admits an FPT algorithm by a result of Colin de Verdi\`ere and Magnard [ESA 2021].
  As a direct consequence, we obtain, in a unified way, FPT algorithms for many established topological crossing number variants, including, e.g., fixed-rotation and color-constrained ones. While some of these variants already had previously published FPT algorithms, for many of them we obtain algorithms with a better runtime. Moreover, our framework applies to drawings in any fixed surface and, for instance, solves the natural surface generalizations of k-planar, k-quasi-planar, min-k-planar, and k-gap crossing numbers, as well as the joint and the edge crossing numbers, the skewness, and the splitting number in surfaces, all of which except the splitting number have not been handled in surfaces other than the plane yet.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness of Approximation for Geometric Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Geometric Bin Packing (GBP) problem is a generalization of Bin Packing where the input is a set of $d$-dimensional rectangles, and the goal is to pack them into unit $d$-dimensional cubes efficiently. It is NP-Hard to obtain a PTAS for the problem, even when $d=2$. For general $d$, the best-known approximation algorithm has an approximation guarantee exponential in $d$, while the best hardness of approximation is still a small constant inapproximability from the case when $d=2$. In this paper, we show that the problem cannot be approximated within $d^{1-\epsilon}$ factor unless NP=P.
  Recently, $d$-dimensional Vector Bin Packing, a closely related problem to the GBP, was shown to be hard to approximate within $\Omega(\log d)$ when $d$ is a fixed constant, using a notion of Packing Dimension of set families. In this paper, we introduce a geometric analog of it, the Geometric Packing Dimension of set families. While we fall short of obtaining similar inapproximability results for the Geometric Bin Packing problem when $d$ is fixed, we prove a couple of key properties of the Geometric Packing Dimension which highlight fundamental differences between Geometric Bin Packing and Vector Bin Packing.</description>
