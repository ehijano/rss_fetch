      <title>Characterization of a novel time-resolved, real-time scintillation dosimetry system for ultra-high dose rate radiation therapy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Scintillation dosimetry has promising qualities for ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) radiotherapy (RT), but no system has shown compatibility with mean dose rates ($\bar{DR}$) above 100 Gy/s and doses per pulse ($D_p$) exceeding 1.5 Gy typical of UHDR (FLASH)-RT. The aim of this study was to characterize a novel scintillator dosimetry system with the potential of accommodating UHDRs. Methods: A thorough dosimetric characterization of the system was performed on an UHDR electron beamline. The system's response as a function of dose, $\bar{DR}$, $D_p$, and the pulse dose rate ${DR}_p$ was investigated, together with the system's dose sensitivity (signal per unit dose) as a function of dose history. The capabilities of the system for time-resolved dosimetric readout were also evaluated. Results: Within a tolerance of $\pm$3% the system exhibited dose linearity and was independent of $\bar{DR}$ and $D_p$ within the tested ranges of 1.8-1341 Gy/s and 0.005-7.68 Gy, respectively. A 6% reduction in the signal per unit dose was observed as ${DR}_p$ was increased from 8.9e4-1.8e6 Gy/s. Additionally, the dose delivered per integration window of the continuously sampling photodetector had to remain between 0.028 and 11.64 Gy to preserve a stable signal response per unit dose. The system accurately measured $D_p$ of individual pulses delivered at up to 120 Hz. The day-to-day variation of the signal per unit dose at a reference setup varied by up to $\pm$13% but remained consistent (&lt;$\pm$2%) within each day of measurements and showed no signal loss as a function of dose history. Conclusions: With daily calibrations and ${DR}_p$ specific correction factors, the system reliably provides real-time, millisecond-resolved dosimetric measurements of pulsed conventional and UHDR beams from typical electron linacs, marking an important advancement in UHDR dosimetry.</description>

      <title>Programming the scalable optical learning operator with spatial-spectral optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic computers have evolved drastically over the past years with an ever-growing demand for improved performance. However, the transfer of information from memory and high energy consumption have emerged as issues that require solutions. Optical techniques are considered promising solutions to these problems with higher speed than their electronic counterparts and with reduced energy consumption. Here, we use the optical reservoir computing framework we have previously described (Scalable Optical Learning Operator or SOLO) to program the spatial-spectral output of the light after nonlinear propagation in a multimode fiber. The novelty in the current paper is that the system is programmed through an output sampling scheme, similar to that used in hyperspectral imaging in astronomy. Linear and nonlinear computations are performed by light in the multimode fiber and the high dimensional spatial-spectral information at the fiber output is optically programmed before it reaches the camera. We then used a digital computer to classify the programmed output of the multi-mode fiber using a simple, single layer network. When combining front-end programming and the proposed spatial-spectral programming, we were able to achieve 89.9% classification accuracy on the dataset consisting of chest X-ray images from COVID-19 patients. At the same time, we obtained a decrease of 99% in the number of tunable parameters compared to an equivalently performing digital neural network. These results show that the performance of programmed SOLO is comparable with cutting-edge electronic computing platforms, albeit with a much-reduced number of electronic operations.</description>

      <title>An Experimentally Benchmarked Geant4 SiPM-Based Scintillator Detector Simulation Platform for Gamma Ray Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation detection is vital for naturally occurring radioactive material detection, port and border monitoring, and homeland security operations. SiPM-based single-volume scintillator detectors offer a cost-effective and robust solution that enables timely radioactive site surveys, while retaining accuracy and sensitivity sufficient for isotope identification. Enhanced site surveying can be achieved by optimising scintillator detector design. In this work, a detailed GAGG:Ce, CLLBC:Ce, BGO, NaI:Tl, and CsI:Tl SiPM-based scintillator detector simulation platform was developed with the Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit, Geant4, and experimentally benchmarked. This simulation platform successfully predicted the spectral features for selected gamma ray emitting isotopes with energies between 30 keV to 2 MeV. The full width half maximum (FWHM) and normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) between simulated and experimental energy spectra were also compared. The majority of simulated FWHM values reproduced the experimental results within 2% and the NCCC values demonstrated agreement between the simulated and experimental energy spectra. Discrepancies in these figures of merit can be attributed to detector signal processing electronics modelling, geometry approximations, and multiple Compton scattering within the detector and surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Speckle Noise Reduction in Ultrasound Images using Denoising Auto-encoder with Skip Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely used medical tool for non-invasive diagnosis, but its images often contain speckle noise which can lower their resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio. This can make it more difficult to extract, recognize, and analyze features in the images, as well as impair the accuracy of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques and the ability of doctors to interpret the images. Reducing speckle noise, therefore, is a crucial step in the preprocessing of ultrasound images. Researchers have proposed several speckle reduction methods, but no single method takes all relevant factors into account. In this paper, we compare seven such methods: Median, Gaussian, Bilateral, Average, Weiner, Anisotropic and Denoising auto-encoder without and with skip connections in terms of their ability to preserve features and edges while effectively reducing noise. In an experimental study, a convolutional noise-removing auto-encoder with skip connection, a deep learning method, was used to improve ultrasound images of breast cancer. This method involved adding speckle noise at various levels. The results of the deep learning method were compared to those of traditional image enhancement methods, and it was found that the proposed method was more effective. To assess the performance of these algorithms, we use three established evaluation metrics and present both filtered images and statistical data.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Strategy for Autonomous Guidewire Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The treatment of cardiovascular diseases requires complex and challenging navigation of a guidewire and catheter. This often leads to lengthy interventions during which the patient and clinician are exposed to X-ray radiation. Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches have shown promise in learning this task and may be the key to automating catheter navigation during robotized interventions. Yet, existing training methods show limited capabilities at generalizing to unseen vascular anatomies, requiring to be retrained each time the geometry changes. Methods: In this paper, we propose a zero-shot learning strategy for three-dimensional autonomous endovascular navigation. Using a very small training set of branching patterns, our reinforcement learning algorithm is able to learn a control that can then be applied to unseen vascular anatomies without retraining. Results: We demonstrate our method on 4 different vascular systems, with an average success rate of 95% at reaching random targets on these anatomies. Our strategy is also computationally efficient, allowing the training of our controller to be performed in only 2 hours. Conclusion: Our training method proved its ability to navigate unseen geometries with different characteristics, thanks to a nearly shape-invariant observation space.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained quantitative magnetization transfer imaging: disentangling T1 of the free and semi-solid spin pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the inception of magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, it has been widely assumed that Henkelman's two spin pools have similar longitudinal relaxation times, which motivated many researchers to constrain them to each other. However, several recent publications reported a $T_1^s$ of the semi-solid spin pool that is much shorter than $T_1^f$ of the free pool. While these studies tailored experiments for robust proofs-of-concept, we here aim to quantify the disentangled relaxation processes on a voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e., with an effective resolution of 1.24mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an unconstrained MT model. We scanned four people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and four healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated $T_1^f \approx 1.84$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.34$s in healthy white matter. Our results confirm the reports that $T_1^s \ll T_1^f$ and we argue that this finding identifies MT as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in brain tissue. Moreover, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s \approx 0.212$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$ in normal-appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences between individuals with MS and controls.</description>

      <title>The Larmor frequency shift of a white matter magnetic microstructure model with multiple sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic susceptibility imaging may provide valuable information about chemical composition and microstructural organization of tissue. However, its estimation from the MRI signal phase is particularly difficult as it is sensitive to magnetic tissue properties ranging from the molecular to macroscopic scale. The MRI Larmor frequency shift measured in white matter (WM) tissue depends on the myelinated axons and other magnetizable sources such as iron-filled ferritin. We have previously derived the Larmor frequency shift arising from a dense media of cylinders with scalar susceptibility and arbitrary orientation dispersion. Here we extend our model to include microscopic WM susceptibility anisotropy as well as spherical inclusions with scalar susceptibility to represent subcellular structures, biologically stored iron etc. We validate our analytical results with computer simulations and investigate the feasibility of estimating susceptibility using simple iterative linear least squares without regularization or preconditioning. This is done in a digital brain phantom synthesized from diffusion MRI (dMRI) measurements of an ex vivo mouse brain at ultra-high field.</description>
