      <title>An Ambit Field Framework for the Full Panel of Day-ahead Electricity Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the often overlooked fact that electricity spot prices in individual European generation zones evolve as a high dimensional panel structure. A general continuous time framework is developed by formulating the panel as an ambit field indexed by a cylinder surface, where the cross sectional dimension is represented by a circle. This requires a treatment of ambit fields on manifolds, but the departure from Euclidean space allows for embedding intrinsic dependence structures into the index set in a flexible and parameter-free way, where the daily delivery periods have a canonical mapping onto the circle. The model is a natural space-time extension of volatility modulated L\'evy-driven Volterra processes, which have previously been studied in the context of energy markets, and the pricing of electricity derivatives turns out to be essentially as analytically tractable as in the null-spatial setting. The space-time framework extends the scope of possible derivatives to products written on individual delivery periods, where spreads between these constitute an interesting example. We establish useful formulas for the pricing of various derivatives along with a simulation scheme, and study specifications of the dependence structure in detail.</description>

      <title>Invariance of finite-dimensional realisations of Heath-Jarrow-Morton models under diffusion estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify all smooth manifolds of curves for Heath-Jarrow-Morton models that are consistent with any tangential diffusion coefficient. In fact, we show that these manifolds cannot be affine but must be of linear-rational type.</description>

      <title>The randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a G-randomly distorted capacity and risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study randomly distorted Choquet integrals with respect to a capacity c on a measurable space ({\Omega},F), where the capacity c is distorted by a G-measurable random distortion function (with G a sub-{\sigma}-algebra of F). We establish some fundamental properties, including the comonotonic additivity of these integrals under suitable assumptions on the underlying capacity space. We provide a representation result for comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the first-order stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c) in terms of these randomly distorted Choquet integrals. We also present the case where the random distortion functions are concave. In this case, the G-randomly distorted Choquet integrals are characterised in terms of comonotonic additive conditional risk measures which are monotone with respect to the stop-loss stochastic dominance relation (with respect to the capacity c). We provide examples, extending some well-known risk measures in finance and insurance, such as the Value at Risk and the Average Value at Risk.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Multifractality in Bitcoin Realised Volatility: Implications for Rough Volatility Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the applicability of rough volatility models to Bitcoin realised volatility using the normalised p-variation framework of Cont and Das (2024). Applying this model free estimator to high-frequency Bitcoin data from 2017 to 2024 across multiple sampling resolutions, we find that the normalised statistic remains strictly negative throughout, precluding the estimation of a valid roughness index. Stationarity tests and robustness checks reveal no significant evidence of non-stationarity or structural breaks as explanatory factors. Instead, convergent evidence from three complementary diagnostics, namely multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, log-log moment scaling, and wavelet leaders, reveals a multifractal structure in Bitcoin volatility. This scale-dependent behaviour violates the homogeneity assumptions underlying rough volatility estimation and accounts for the estimator's systematic failure. These findings suggest that while rough volatility models perform well in traditional markets, they are structurally misaligned with the empirical features of Bitcoin volatility.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Factor-Augmented Models for Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasts are vital in modern finance for risk management, portfolio allocation, and strategic decision-making. However, existing methods face key limitations. Fully multivariate models, while comprehensive, are computationally infeasible for realistic portfolios. Factor models, though efficient, primarily use static factor loadings, failing to capture evolving volatility co-movements when they are most critical. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, model-agnostic Factor-Augmented Volatility Forecast framework. Our approach employs a time-varying factor model to extract a compact set of dynamic, cross-sectional factors from realized volatilities with minimal computational cost. These factors are then integrated into both statistical and AI-based forecasting models, enabling a unified system that jointly models asset-specific dynamics and evolving market-wide co-movements. Our framework demonstrates strong performance across two prominent asset classes-large-cap U.S. technology equities and major cryptocurrencies-over both short-term (1-day) and medium-term (7-day) horizons. Using a suite of linear and non-linear AI-driven models, we consistently observe substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and economic value. Notably, a practical pairs-trading strategy built on our forecasts delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and profitability, particularly under adverse market conditions.</description>
