      <title>Fast frequency reconstruction using Deep Learning for event recognition in ring laser data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of a frequency with minimal delay from a sinusoidal signal is a common task in several fields; for example Ring Laser Gyroscopes, since their output signal is a beat frequency. While conventional methods require several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10 milliseconds. This enables rapid trigger generation. The method outperforms standard Fourier-based techniques, improving frequency estimation precision by a factor of 2 in the operational range of GINGERINO, our Ring Laser Gyroscope.\\ In addition to fast frequency estimation, we introduce an automated classification framework to identify physical disturbances in the signal, such as laser instabilities and seismic events, achieving accuracy rates between 99\% and 100\% on independent test datasets for the seismic class. These results mark a step forward in integrating artificial intelligence into signal analysis for geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).</description>

      <title>HydroFusion-LMF: Semi-Supervised Multi-Network Fusion with Large-Model Adaptation for Long-Term Daily Runoff Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles, regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet, PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement, frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance, flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment, augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter / LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a ~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818, improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram of Fe1-xOx under Earth's inner core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superionic state is a phase of matter in which liquid-like ionic mobility coexists with a solid crystalline lattice. Recently identified in Earth's inner core (IC), this state has attracted considerable attention for its unique kinetic behavior and geophysical implications. However, the ab initio phase diagram describing the equilibrium between the superionic phase and the liquid solution under core conditions remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a thermodynamic approach to compute the Gibbs free energy and construct the ab initio superionic-liquid phase diagram for the Fe1-xOx system under IC conditions. We find that oxygen forms superionic states in both hcp and bcc Fe phases, with a pronounced influence on cooperative diffusion of iron in the bcc lattice. The stability fields of these superionic phases are sensitive to oxygen stoichiometry. The presence of superionic states leads to a higher oxygen concentration in the IC than previously estimated. Our work establishes a framework for investigating superionic-liquid equilibria under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Strong noise attenuation of seismic data based on Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic data acquisition is often affected by various types of noise, which degrade data quality and hinder subsequent interpretation. Recovery of seismic data becomes particularly challenging in the presence of strong noise, which significantly impacts both data accuracy and geological analysis. This study proposes a novel single-encoder, multiple-decoder network based on Nash equalization (SEMD-Nash) for effective strong noise attenuation in seismic data. The main contributions of this method are as follows: First, we design a shared encoder-multi-decoder architecture, where an improved encoder extracts key features from the noisy data, and three parallel decoders reconstruct the denoised seismic signal from different perspectives. Second, we develop a multi-objective optimization system that integrates three loss functions-Mean Squared Error (MSE), Perceived Loss, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)-to ensure effective signal reconstruction, high-order feature preservation, and structural integrity. Third, we introduce the Nash Equalization Weight Optimizer, which dynamically adjusts the weights of the loss functions, balancing the optimization objectives to improve the models robustness and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses strong noise while preserving the geological characteristics of the seismic data.</description>
