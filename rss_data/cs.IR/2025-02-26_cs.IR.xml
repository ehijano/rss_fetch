      <title>External Large Foundation Model: How to Efficiently Serve Trillions of Parameters for Online Ads Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ads recommendation is a prominent service of online advertising systems and has been actively studied. Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Tongue Query Elicitation for Simulated Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) search occurs when a user struggles to recall a specific identifier, such as a document title. While common, existing search systems often fail to effectively support TOT scenarios. Research on TOT retrieval is further constrained by the challenge of collecting queries, as current approaches rely heavily on community question-answering (CQA) websites, leading to labor-intensive evaluation and domain bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two methods for eliciting TOT queries - leveraging large language models (LLMs) and human participants - to facilitate simulated evaluations of TOT retrieval systems. Our LLM-based TOT user simulator generates synthetic TOT queries at scale, achieving high correlations with how CQA-based TOT queries rank TOT retrieval systems when tested in the Movie domain. Additionally, these synthetic queries exhibit high linguistic similarity to CQA-derived queries. For human-elicited queries, we developed an interface that uses visual stimuli to place participants in a TOT state, enabling the collection of natural queries. In the Movie domain, system rank correlation and linguistic similarity analyses confirm that human-elicited queries are both effective and closely resemble CQA-based queries. These approaches reduce reliance on CQA-based data collection while expanding coverage to underrepresented domains, such as Landmark and Person. LLM-elicited queries for the Movie, Landmark, and Person domains have been released as test queries in the TREC 2024 TOT track, with human-elicited queries scheduled for inclusion in the TREC 2025 TOT track. Additionally, we provide source code for synthetic query generation and the human query collection interface, along with curated visual stimuli used for eliciting TOT queries.</description>

      <title>HyperG: Hypergraph-Enhanced LLMs for Structured Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that substantial amounts of domain-specific knowledge are stored in structured formats, such as web data organized through HTML, Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to fully comprehend this structured information to broaden their applications in various real-world downstream tasks. Current approaches for applying LLMs to structured data fall into two main categories: serialization-based and operation-based methods. Both approaches, whether relying on serialization or using SQL-like operations as an intermediary, encounter difficulties in fully capturing structural relationships and effectively handling sparse data. To address these unique characteristics of structured data, we propose HyperG, a hypergraph-based generation framework aimed at enhancing LLMs' ability to process structured knowledge. Specifically, HyperG first augment sparse data with contextual information, leveraging the generative power of LLMs, and incorporate a prompt-attentive hypergraph learning (PHL) network to encode both the augmented information and the intricate structural relationships within the data. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of HyperG, we conduct extensive experiments across two different downstream tasks requiring structured knowledge.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Graph Similarity Computation Based on Graph Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph similarity learning, crucial for tasks such as graph classification and similarity search, focuses on measuring the similarity between two graph-structured entities. The core challenge in this field is effectively managing the interactions between graphs. Traditional methods often entail separate, redundant computations for each graph pair, leading to unnecessary complexity. This paper revolutionizes the approach by introducing a parallel graph interaction method called graph fusion. By merging the node sequences of graph pairs into a single large graph, our method leverages a global attention mechanism to facilitate interaction computations and to harvest cross-graph insights. We further assess the similarity between graph pairs at two distinct levels-graph-level and node-level-introducing two innovative, yet straightforward, similarity computation algorithms. Extensive testing across five public datasets shows that our model not only outperforms leading baseline models in graph-to-graph classification and regression tasks but also sets a new benchmark for performance and efficiency. The code for this paper is open-source and available at https://github.com/LLiRarry/GFM-code.git</description>

      <title>A Unified Bayesian Perspective for Conventional and Robust Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new perspective on the origin and interpretation of adaptive filters. By applying Bayesian principles of recursive inference from the state-space model and using a series of simplifications regarding the structure of the solution, we can present, in a unified framework, derivations of many adaptive filters which depend on the probabilistic model of the observational noise. In particular, under a Gaussian model, we obtain solutions well-known in the literature (such as LMS, NLMS, or Kalman filter), while using non-Gaussian noise, we obtain new families of adaptive filter. Notably, under assumption of Laplacian noise, we obtain a family of robust filters of which the signed-error algorithm is a well-known member, while other algorithms, derived effortlessly in the proposed framework, are entirely new. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate the properties and provide a better insight into the performance of the derived adaptive filters.</description>

      <title>Rank1: Test-Time Compute for Reranking in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Rank1, the first reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute. Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.</description>

      <title>Data Voids and Warning Banners on Google Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The content moderation systems used by social media sites are a topic of widespread interest and research, but less is known about the use of similar systems by web search engines. For example, Google Search attempts to help its users navigate three distinct types of data voids--when the available search results are deemed low-quality, low-relevance, or rapidly-changing--by placing one of three corresponding warning banners at the top of the search page. Here we collected 1.4M unique search queries shared on social media to surface Google's warning banners, examine when and why those banners were applied, and train deep learning models to identify data voids beyond Google's classifications. Across three data collection waves (Oct 2023, Mar 2024, Sept 2024), we found that Google returned a warning banner for about 1% of our search queries, with substantial churn in the set of queries that received a banner across waves. The low-quality banners, which warn users that their results "may not have reliable information on this topic," were especially rare, and their presence was associated with low-quality domains in the search results and conspiracy-related keywords in the search query. Low-quality banner presence was also inconsistent over short time spans, even when returning highly similar search results. In August 2024, low-quality banners stopped appearing on the SERPs we collected, but average search result quality remained largely unchanged, suggesting they may have been discontinued by Google. Using our deep learning models to analyze both queries and search results in context, we identify 29 to 58 times more low-quality data voids than there were low-quality banners, and find a similar number after the banners had disappeared. Our findings point to the need for greater transparency on search engines' content moderation practices, especially around important events like elections.</description>

      <title>The GigaMIDI Dataset with Features for Expressive Music Performance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), introduced in 1983, revolutionized music production by allowing computers and instruments to communicate efficiently. MIDI files encode musical instructions compactly, facilitating convenient music sharing. They benefit Music Information Retrieval (MIR), aiding in research on music understanding, computational musicology, and generative music. The GigaMIDI dataset contains over 1.4 million unique MIDI files, encompassing 1.8 billion MIDI note events and over 5.3 million MIDI tracks. GigaMIDI is currently the largest collection of symbolic music in MIDI format available for research purposes under fair dealing. Distinguishing between non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks is challenging, as MIDI files do not inherently make this distinction. To address this issue, we introduce a set of innovative heuristics for detecting expressive music performance. These include the Distinctive Note Velocity Ratio (DNVR) heuristic, which analyzes MIDI note velocity; the Distinctive Note Onset Deviation Ratio (DNODR) heuristic, which examines deviations in note onset times; and the Note Onset Median Metric Level (NOMML) heuristic, which evaluates onset positions relative to metric levels. Our evaluation demonstrates these heuristics effectively differentiate between non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks. Furthermore, after evaluation, we create the most substantial expressive MIDI dataset, employing our heuristic, NOMML. This curated iteration of GigaMIDI encompasses expressively-performed instrument tracks detected by NOMML, containing all General MIDI instruments, constituting 31% of the GigaMIDI dataset, totalling 1,655,649 tracks.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Gender Bias in Recommendation Systems and Enhancing Category-Aware Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are now an integral part of our daily lives. We rely on them for tasks such as discovering new movies, finding friends on social media, and connecting job seekers with relevant opportunities. Given their vital role, we must ensure these recommendations are free from societal stereotypes. Therefore, evaluating and addressing such biases in recommendation systems is crucial. Previous work evaluating the fairness of recommended items fails to capture certain nuances as they mainly focus on comparing performance metrics for different sensitive groups. In this paper, we introduce a set of comprehensive metrics for quantifying gender bias in recommendations. Specifically, we show the importance of evaluating fairness on a more granular level, which can be achieved using our metrics to capture gender bias using categories of recommended items like genres for movies. Furthermore, we show that employing a category-aware fairness metric as a regularization term along with the main recommendation loss during training can help effectively minimize bias in the models' output. We experiment on three real-world datasets, using five baseline models alongside two popular fairness-aware models, to show the effectiveness of our metrics in evaluating gender bias. Our metrics help provide an enhanced insight into bias in recommended items compared to previous metrics. Additionally, our results demonstrate how incorporating our regularization term significantly improves the fairness in recommendations for different categories without substantial degradation in overall recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>On Synthetic Data Strategies for Domain-Specific Generative Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates synthetic data generation strategies in developing generative retrieval models for domain-specific corpora, thereby addressing the scalability challenges inherent in manually annotating in-domain queries. We study the data strategies for a two-stage training framework: in the first stage, which focuses on learning to decode document identifiers from queries, we investigate LLM-generated queries across multiple granularity (e.g. chunks, sentences) and domain-relevant search constraints that can better capture nuanced relevancy signals. In the second stage, which aims to refine document ranking through preference learning, we explore the strategies for mining hard negatives based on the initial model's predictions. Experiments on public datasets over diverse domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic data generation and hard negative sampling approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of quality data for low-resource Bantu languages, significant challenges are presented in text classification and other practical implementations. In this paper, we introduce an advanced model combining Language-Independent Data Augmentation (LiDA) with Multi-Head Attention based weighted embeddings to selectively enhance critical data points and improve text classification performance. This integration allows us to create robust data augmentation strategies that are effective across various linguistic contexts, ensuring that our model can handle the unique syntactic and semantic features of Bantu languages. This approach not only addresses the data scarcity issue but also sets a foundation for future research in low-resource language processing and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>ViDoRAG: Visual Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Dynamic Iterative Reasoning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark.</description>

      <title>AfroXLMR-Comet: Multilingual Knowledge Distillation with Attention Matching for Low-Resource languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model compression through knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising approach for deploying large language models in resource-constrained environments. However, existing methods often struggle to maintain performance when distilling multilingual models, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid distillation approach that combines traditional knowledge distillation with a simplified attention matching mechanism, specifically designed for multilingual contexts. Our method introduces an extremely compact student model architecture, significantly smaller than conventional multilingual models. We evaluate our approach on five African languages: Kinyarwanda, Swahili, Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba. The distilled student model; AfroXLMR-Comet successfully captures both the output distribution and internal attention patterns of a larger teacher model (AfroXLMR-Large) while reducing the model size by over 85%. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves competitive performance compared to the teacher model, maintaining an accuracy within 85% of the original model's performance while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our work provides a practical framework for deploying efficient multilingual models in resource-constrained environments, particularly benefiting applications involving African languages.</description>

      <title>LevelRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multi-hop Logic Planning over Rewriting Augmented Searchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a crucial method for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating external knowledge into their responses. Existing RAG methods typically employ query rewriting to clarify the user intent and manage multi-hop logic, while using hybrid retrieval to expand search scope. However, the tight coupling of query rewriting to the dense retriever limits its compatibility with hybrid retrieval, impeding further RAG performance improvements. To address this challenge, we introduce a high-level searcher that decomposes complex queries into atomic queries, independent of any retriever-specific optimizations. Additionally, to harness the strengths of sparse retrievers for precise keyword retrieval, we have developed a new sparse searcher that employs Lucene syntax to enhance retrieval accuracy.Alongside web and dense searchers, these components seamlessly collaborate within our proposed method, \textbf{LevelRAG}. In LevelRAG, the high-level searcher orchestrates the retrieval logic, while the low-level searchers (sparse, web, and dense) refine the queries for optimal retrieval. This approach enhances both the completeness and accuracy of the retrieval process, overcoming challenges associated with current query rewriting techniques in hybrid retrieval scenarios. Empirical experiments conducted on five datasets, encompassing both single-hop and multi-hop question answering tasks, demonstrate the superior performance of LevelRAG compared to existing RAG methods. Notably, LevelRAG outperforms the state-of-the-art proprietary model, GPT4o, underscoring its effectiveness and potential impact on the RAG field.</description>

      <title>How Vital is the Jurisprudential Relevance: Law Article Intervened Legal Case Retrieval and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal case retrieval (LCR) aims to automatically scour for comparable legal cases based on a given query, which is crucial for offering relevant precedents to support the judgment in intelligent legal systems. Due to similar goals, it is often associated with a similar case matching (LCM) task. To address them, a daunting challenge is assessing the uniquely defined legal-rational similarity within the judicial domain, which distinctly deviates from the semantic similarities in general text retrieval. Past works either tagged domain-specific factors or incorporated reference laws to capture legal-rational information. However, their heavy reliance on expert or unrealistic assumptions restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model named LCM-LAI to solve the above challenges. Through meticulous theoretical analysis, LCM-LAI employs a dependent multi-task learning framework to capture legal-rational information within legal cases by a law article prediction (LAP) sub-task, without any additional assumptions in inference. Besides, LCM-LAI proposes an article-aware attention mechanism to evaluate the legal-rational similarity between across-case sentences based on law distribution, which is more effective than conventional semantic similarity. Weperform a series of exhaustive experiments including two different tasks involving four real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that LCM-LAI achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>DRAMA: Diverse Augmentation from Large Language Models to Smaller Dense Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong effectiveness and robustness while fine-tuned as dense retrievers. However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analyzing the Influence of Non-Item Pages on Sequential Next-Item Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing sequences of interactions between users and items, sequential recommendation models can learn user intent and make predictions about the next item. Next to item interactions, most systems also have interactions with what we call non-item pages: these pages are not related to specific items but still can provide insights into the user's interests, as, for example, navigation pages. We therefore propose a general way to include these non-item pages in sequential recommendation models to enhance next-item prediction.
  First, we demonstrate the influence of non-item pages on following interactions using the hypotheses testing framework HypTrails and propose methods for representing non-item pages in sequential recommendation models. Subsequently, we adapt popular sequential recommender models to integrate non-item pages and investigate their performance with different item representation strategies as well as their ability to handle noisy data. To show the general capabilities of the models to integrate non-item pages, we create a synthetic dataset for a controlled setting and then evaluate the improvements from including non-item pages on two real-world datasets.
  Our results show that non-item pages are a valuable source of information, and incorporating them in sequential recommendation models increases the performance of next-item prediction across all analyzed model architectures.</description>

      <title>HyPA-RAG: A Hybrid Parameter Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for AI Legal and Policy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in AI legal and policy applications due to outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and poor reasoning in complex contexts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address these issues by incorporating external knowledge, but suffer from retrieval errors, ineffective context integration, and high operational costs. This paper presents the Hybrid Parameter-Adaptive RAG (HyPA-RAG) system, designed for the AI legal domain, with NYC Local Law 144 (LL144) as the test case. HyPA-RAG integrates a query complexity classifier for adaptive parameter tuning, a hybrid retrieval approach combining dense, sparse, and knowledge graph methods, and a comprehensive evaluation framework with tailored question types and metrics. Testing on LL144 demonstrates that HyPA-RAG enhances retrieval accuracy, response fidelity, and contextual precision, offering a robust and adaptable solution for high-stakes legal and policy applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern language models frequently include retrieval components to improve their outputs, giving rise to a growing number of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Yet, most existing work in RAG has underemphasized fair ranking techniques and neglected the diverse interests of all stakeholders. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of RAG systems that incorporate fairness-aware rankings, focusing on both ranking fairness and attribution fairness - ensuring equitable exposure of sources cited in the final text. We specifically examine item-side fairness, i.e., whether retrieved documents receive balanced exposure, and assess how this affects both the system's overall performance and the eventual distribution of cited sources. Across twelve RAG models and seven tasks, we find that fairness-aware retrieval frequently retains or even improves ranking effectiveness and generation quality, countering the widespread belief that fairness compromises system performance. Moreover, we show that fair retrieval leads to more balanced attribution in the final responses, ensuring that the cited sources are credited more equitably. Our results underscore the importance of item-side fairness throughout both retrieval and generation phases, offering key insights for building more responsible and equitable RAG systems and illustrating promising avenues for future exploration in fair ranking and source attribution.</description>

      <title>Collaboration of Large Language Models and Small Recommendation Models for Device-Cloud Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Recommendation (LLM4Rec) is a promising research direction that has demonstrated exceptional performance in this field. However, its inability to capture real-time user preferences greatly limits the practical application of LLM4Rec because (i) LLMs are costly to train and infer frequently, and (ii) LLMs struggle to access real-time data (its large number of parameters poses an obstacle to deployment on devices). Fortunately, small recommendation models (SRMs) can effectively supplement these shortcomings of LLM4Rec diagrams by consuming minimal resources for frequent training and inference, and by conveniently accessing real-time data on devices.
  In light of this, we designed the Device-Cloud LLM-SRM Collaborative Recommendation Framework (LSC4Rec) under a device-cloud collaboration setting. LSC4Rec aims to integrate the advantages of both LLMs and SRMs, as well as the benefits of cloud and edge computing, achieving a complementary synergy. We enhance the practicability of LSC4Rec by designing three strategies: collaborative training, collaborative inference, and intelligent request. During training, LLM generates candidate lists to enhance the ranking ability of SRM in collaborative scenarios and enables SRM to update adaptively to capture real-time user interests. During inference, LLM and SRM are deployed on the cloud and on the device, respectively. LLM generates candidate lists and initial ranking results based on user behavior, and SRM get reranking results based on the candidate list, with final results integrating both LLM's and SRM's scores. The device determines whether a new candidate list is needed by comparing the consistency of the LLM's and SRM's sorted lists. Our comprehensive and extensive experimental analysis validates the effectiveness of each strategy in LSC4Rec.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Augmented Social Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in modern content platforms, yet traditional behavior-based models often face challenges in addressing cold users with sparse interaction data. Engaging these users, however, remains critical for sustaining platform growth. To tackle this issue, we propose leveraging reconstructed social graph to complement interest representations derived from behavioral data. Despite the widespread availability of social graphs on content platforms, their utility is hindered by social-relation noise and inconsistencies between social and behavioral interests. To mitigate noise propagation in graph data and extract reliable social interests, we introduce a dual-view denoising framework. This approach first applies low-rank singular value decomposition (SVD) to the user-item interaction matrix, generating denoised user embeddings for reconstructing the social graph. It then employs contrastive learning to align the original and reconstructed social graphs. To address the discrepancy between social and behavioral interests, we utilize a mutual distillation mechanism that decomposes interests into four subcategories: aligned social/behavioral interests and social/behavioral-specific interests, enabling effective integration of the two. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our method, particularly in improving recommendations for cold users, by combining social and behavioral data. The implementation of our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/WANGLin0126/CLSRec.</description>

      <title>NV-Embed: Improved Techniques for Training LLMs as Generalist Embedding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only LLM-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we introduce NV-Embed, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last &lt;EOS&gt; token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed-v1 and NV-Embed-v2 models obtained the No.1 position on the MTEB leaderboard (as of May 24 and August 30, 2024, respectively) across 56 tasks, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time. It also achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB. We further provide the analysis of model compression techniques for generalist embedding models.</description>

      <title>Topic-FlipRAG: Topic-Orientated Adversarial Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for tasks such as question answering and content generation. However, their increasing impact on public opinion and information dissemination has made them a critical focus for security research due to inherent vulnerabilities. Previous studies have predominantly addressed attacks targeting factual or single-query manipulations. In this paper, we address a more practical scenario: topic-oriented adversarial opinion manipulation attacks on RAG models, where LLMs are required to reason and synthesize multiple perspectives, rendering them particularly susceptible to systematic knowledge poisoning. Specifically, we propose Topic-FlipRAG, a two-stage manipulation attack pipeline that strategically crafts adversarial perturbations to influence opinions across related queries. This approach combines traditional adversarial ranking attack techniques and leverages the extensive internal relevant knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to execute semantic-level perturbations. Experiments show that the proposed attacks effectively shift the opinion of the model's outputs on specific topics, significantly impacting user information perception. Current mitigation methods cannot effectively defend against such attacks, highlighting the necessity for enhanced safeguards for RAG systems, and offering crucial insights for LLM security research.</description>
