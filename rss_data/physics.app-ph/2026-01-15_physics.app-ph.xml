      <title>Generalization of Stoney's equation for flexoelectric thin films on elastic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a thin film is deposited on an incompatible elastic substrate, the film develops an elastic mismatch strain, causing the film-substrate system to bend. Stoney's equation relates the curvature of the bent film-substrate system with the residual stress developed in the film, and can be used to infer film properties from curvature measurements. Certain materials exhibit electromechanical coupling, such as piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity, which can alter the curvature and strains. In this work, we generalize Stoney's equation to include flexoelectric and piezoelectric effects in the film. Considering both open and closed circuit configurations, as well as uniform and non-uniform film properties, we compare different cases of electromechanical coupling and discuss their influence on curvature, strains, and electric polarization in the film.</description>

      <title>A complete fs-laser-ablation route to miniaturized single-crystal PMN-PT piezoelectric actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel fabrication route for miniaturized piezoelectric actuators that relies exclusively on processes based on femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications. These results establish fs-laser-based fabrication as a versatile and scalable method for next-generation piezoelectric actuators, paving the way for advanced strain-engineering approaches in semiconductor quantum optics and integrated quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Twisted Ferromagnetic Domain Wall as a Spin-Wave Diffraction Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of spin-wave scattering by a twisted domain wall (DW) in a two-dimensional ferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy. While the twisted DW generates an effective gauge field for spin waves, leading to a deflection of their trajectories, our main focus is on a distinct effect that arises when a hard-axis anisotropy is present in addition to the easy-axis anisotropy. In this case, the translational symmetry of the spin-wave Hamiltonian along the DW is broken, resulting in a periodic modulation of the Hamiltonian. This periodicity leads to the formation of multiple diffracted spin wave modes on both sides of the DW, engendering a DW-induced magnonic diffraction pattern. The interplay between the emergent gauge field and the anisotropy-induced periodicity reveals rich spin-wave dynamics and suggests potential applications for manipulating magnon flow in two-dimensional magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to determine unambiguously the Berry phase solely from quantum oscillations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry phase, a fundamental geometric phase in quantum systems, has become a crucial tool for probing the topological properties of materials. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, are widely used to extract this phase, but its unambiguous determination remains challenging. This work highlights the inherent ambiguities in interpreting the oscillation phase solely from SdH data, primarily due to the influence of the spin factor $R_S$, which depends on the Land\'e $g$-factor and effective mass. While the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory provides a framework for analyzing oscillations, the unknown g-factor introduces significant uncertainty. For instance, a zero oscillation phase could arise either from a nontrivial Berry phase or a negative $R_S$. We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stabilization of Inverted Magnetization and Antimagnons by Spin Injection in an Extended Magnetic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical perturbations can modify the energy landscape of a physical system, such that unstable equilibrium configurations become stable when subject to an external drive. The magnetic analog of such dynamical stabilization corresponds to saturation of the magnetization against an external field. Here we report dynamical stabilization of the magnetization in thin film bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet by spin current injection from an adjacent Pt layer. Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements demonstrate magnetization reversal against magnetic fields up to 3000 times larger than the film's coercivity once the spin injection surpasses a critical threshold associated with negative damping. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that this process is mediated by the excitation of a large population of incoherent magnons with non-zero wave vector, leading to a transient shortening and subsequent stabilization of the inverted magnetization. The elementary excitations of the high-energy inverted magnetization state are shown to be antimagnons, quasi-particles carrying opposite energy and spin relative to magnons. Our results further reveal how the system's size and minimization of nonlinear magnon scattering processes play a key role in dynamical stabilization, opening new avenues for magnetic state control beyond conventional magnetization switching. Dissipation-driven phase transitions in large-area magnetic systems provide a solid-state platform to study magnonic analogs of relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling and black holes, as well as spin-wave amplification and lasing.</description>

      <title>Coupled Microelectromechanical Drum Resonators for Reservoir Computing via Sideband Pumped Phonon-Cavity Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a bio-inspired machine learning paradigm that exploits the intrinsic dynamics of nonlinear systems with fading memory for efficient temporal information processing. Microelectromechanical resonators offer a promising platform for reservoir computing as they inherently possess the requisite nonlinear and temporal properties while also facilitating the integration of sensing and computing within a single platform. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a physical reservoir computing platform based on two capacitively coupled drum resonators, operating in the MHz frequency regime. Taking advantage of the concept of phonon-cavity electromechanics, a pump tone is applied at the sideband of the phonon cavity while probing one of the coupled modes, analogous to optomechanical systems, thereby creating nonlinear dynamics in energy transfer between the two resonators. Physical reservoir computing is implemented by exploiting the nonlinear response induced through pump amplitude modulation in combination with a time-delay feedback loop, and the performance is evaluated using both parity and Normalized Auto-Regressive Moving Average benchmarks. This work demonstrates a compact microelectromechanical platform for the integration of sensing and reservoir computing. Moreover, the sideband pumping scheme can further extend conventional single resonator reservoir computing to a multimode architecture.</description>

      <title>An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing of malaria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malaria remains a major health threat in low-resource regions and rapid diagnostic tests often lack the sensitivity required for early detection. To address this and help establish more sensitive testing devices, we develop a predictive microscopic model for plasmonic biosensing using metasurfaces. Specifically, we consider the detection of plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a well-known malaria biomarker. An example metasurface is studied to showcase the effective microscopic model - it consists of a gold nanohole array (150nm film; 150nm diameter; 400nm period) and the biochemistry above it is modelled as stacks of closely packed adlayers. Using Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory we link the refractive index of the pLDH biomarker adsorbed layer on top of the metasurface to the bulk concentration of pLDH in the buffer. This effective microscopic model accounts for the combined optical properties of the biochemistry matrix, bound pLDH and the buffer medium. By simulating the sensor using the finite element method and an approximate analytical method, we show that the effective model allows one to determine the sensor response, predict binding interactions, and quantify concentration changes on the sensor surface. We then calculate the sensor sensitivity for our example metasurface and its theoretical limit of detection (LOD). The lowest LOD calculated based on the model is 0.02nM of pLDH, equivalent to 0.7ng/mL, which is a 30 times improvement over current rapid diagnostic tests. While this improvement in performance is highly promising, further work on transferring the ideal theory developed here to field-tested empirical performance will be required. The effective microscopic model we introduce is quite general and the framework developed offers a broadly applicable tool for the design and optimization of other types of highly sensitive plasmonic biosensors.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>
