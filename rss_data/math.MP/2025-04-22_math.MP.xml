      <title>The Dirac operator for the Ruelle-Koopman pair on L^p-spaces: an interplay between Connes distance and symbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denote by $\bm{\mu}$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift \(\sigma\) acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by
  $\ruelle$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $\koopman = \ruelle^{\dagger}$ the Koopman operator, both acting on
  $\lp{2}(\bm{\mu})$. Using a diagonal representation $\pi$, the Ruelle-Koopman pair can be used for defining
  a dynamical Dirac operator $\mathcal{D},$ as in \cite{BL}. $\mathcal{D}$ plays the role of a derivative. In
  \cite{lpspec}, the notion of a spectral triple was generalized to \(\lp{p}\)-operator algebras; in consonance, here, we
  generalize results for $\mathcal{D}$ to results for a Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_p$ , and the associated Connes distance $d_p$,
  to this new \(\lp{p}\) context, \(p \geq 1\). Given the states $\eta, \xi$:
  $d_{p}(\eta, \xi) \defn \sup \{ \,|\eta(a) - \xi(a) |
  where a \in \mathcal{A} and
  \norm{\left[\mathcal{D}_p,\pi(a)\right]} \leq 1\}$.
  The operator $M_f$ acts on $L^p (\mu).$ We explore the relationship of $\mathcal{D}_p$ with dynamics,
  in particular with $f \circ \sigma - f$, the discrete-time derivative of a continuous $f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. Take
  $p,p^{\prime}&gt;0$ satisfying $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{ p^{\prime}}=1$. We show for any continuous function $f$:
  $\norm{\left[ \dirac_p, \pi(\mult_f) \right]} = | \sqrt[\lambda]{\ruelle \abs{f \circ \sigma - f}^{\lambda}} |_{\infty}$,
  where $\lambda = \max\{p, p^\prime\}$.
  Furthermore, we show $\norm{\left[ \mathcal{D}_p, \pi(\koopman^{n} \mathcal{L}^{n})]\right]}=1$
  for all \(n \geq 1\). We also prove
  a formula analogous to the Kantorovich duality formula for minimizing the cost of tensor products.</description>

      <title>Resonant tunneling effect for quantum walks on directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks that depend smoothly on a small parameter $\varepsilon\ge0$ are considered on directed graphs. The asymptotic behavior of the scattering matrix of the quantum walk as $\varepsilon\to+0$ is investigated. It is shown that, in this limit, the scattering matrix does not converge to that for $\varepsilon=0$ at points in the essential spectrum (the unit circle) that are asymptotically approached by a quantum resonance. Furthermore, a phenomenon resembling and extending the resonant tunneling effect is observed by analyzing this discrepancy through resonant states.</description>

      <title>A new representation formula for the logarithmic corotational derivative -- a case study in application of commutator based functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a system consisting of several Dirac fields and a particle, we study the Cauchy problem with random initial data. We assume that the initial measure has zero mean value, a finite mean charge density, a translation-invariant covariance and satisfies a mixing condition. The main result is the long-time convergence of distributions of the random solutions to a limit Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>An equivalence theorem for algebraic and functorial QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel approach to functorial quantum field theories (FQFTs) in the context of Lorentzian geometry. The key challenge is that globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot change the topology of the Cauchy surface. This is addressed and solved by introducing a more flexible concept of bordisms which provide morphisms from tuples of causally disjoint partial Cauchy surfaces to a later-in-time full Cauchy surface. They assemble into a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism pseudo-operad, generalizing the geometric bordism pseudo-categories of Stolz and Teichner. The associated FQFTs are defined as pseudo-multifunctors into a symmetric monoidal category of unital associative algebras. The main result of this paper is an equivalence theorem between such globally hyperbolic Lorentzian FQFTs and algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs), both subject to the time-slice axiom and a mild descent condition called additivity.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Invariant Solutions to the Nonlinear Filtration Equation by Modified Pade Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a mathematical model for oil filtration in a porous medium and its self-similar and traveling wave regimes. The model consists of the equation for conservation mass and dependencies for porosity, permeability, and oil density on pressure. The oil viscosity is considered to be the experimentally expired parabolic relationship on pressure. To close the model, two types of Darcy law are used: the classic one and the dynamic one describing the relaxation processes during filtration. In the former case, self-similar solutions are studied, while in the latter case, traveling wave solutions are the focus. Using the invariant solutions, the initial model is reduced to the nonlinear ordinary differential equations possessing the trajectories vanishing at infinity and representing the moving liquid fronts in porous media. To approximate these solutions, we elaborate the semi-analytic procedure based on modified Pade approximants. In fact, we calculate sequentially Pade approximants up to 3d order for a two-point boundary value problem on the semi-infinite domain. A good agreement of evaluated Pade approximants and numerical solutions is observed. The approach provides relatively simple quasi-rational expressions of solutions and can be easily adapted for other types of model's nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Cayley's First Hyperdeterminant is an Entanglement Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, it was shown that both the concurrence and n-tangle on $2n$-qubits can be expressed in terms of Cayley's first hyperdeterminant, indicating that Cayley's first hyperdeterminant captures at least some aspects of a quantum state's entanglement. In this paper, we rigorously prove that Cayley's first hyperdeterminant is an entanglement measure on $2n$-qudits, and thus a legitimate generalization of the concurrence and n-tangle. In particular, we show that the modulus of the hyperdeterminant and its square both vanish on separable $2n$-qudits, are LU invariants, and are non-increasing on average under LOCC. Lastly, we then consider their convex roof extensions and show that they may in fact be viewed as entanglement measures on mixed states of $2n$-qudits.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces, that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials.
  Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$, exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles.
  We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shockwave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <title>Coupled Instantons In A Four-Well Potential With Application To The Tunneling Of A Composite Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled instantons are introduced by generalizing the double well potential to multiple mutually coupled wells. Physically this corresponds to the simultaneous tunneling of multiple degrees of freedom. A system with four equal minima is examined in detail. It has three instanton types or flavors with distinct actions. For weak coupling and subject to there being a single large (or small) parameter, the interactive system can be handled perturbatively. The zero mode problem arising from time translation symmetry is handled via the Fadeev-Popov procedure. A diagrammatic procedure allows corrections to the fluctuation determinant to be calculated systematically. Independent instanton contributions are summed over by extending the dilute gas approximation to three flavors and energy splittings of the lowest four states is calculated. All tunneling amplitudes are concisely expressed in terms of elementary functions. While the model is possibly useful for a variety of physical systems, an application is made here to the tunneling of a composite particle in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Zernike system revisited: imaginary gauge and Higgs oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze that recently proposed clasical/quantum mechanical interpretation of Zernike system and establish its equivalence to the Higgs oscillator on sphere or pseudosphere (Lobachevsky plane). We show that the non-reality of the classical Zernike Hamiltonian is an insignificant artifact of imaginary gauge and can be eliminated with a canonical transformation. The quantum counterpart of this canonical transformation is a similarity transformation mapping the system to the quantum Higgs oscillator with integration measure depending on $\alpha,\beta$ parameters. When $\alpha=2 \beta$ it results in the Hermitian Hamiltonian describing a free particle on (pseudo)sphere, while deviation from this point leads to a pseudo-Hermitian system.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a variation of the classic ballistic deposition model in which vertically falling blocks can only stick to the top or the upper right corner of growing columns. We establish that the fluctuations of the height function at points near the $t$-axis are given by the GUE ensemble and its correspondent Tracy-Widom limiting distribution. The proof is based on a graphical construction of the process in terms of a directed Last Passage Percolation model.</description>

      <title>Duality Anomalies in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical linearized gravity admits a dual formulation in terms of a higher-rank tensor field. Proposing a prescription for the instanton sectors of linearized gravity and its dual, we show that they may be quantum inequivalent in even dimensions. The duality anomaly is obtained by resolving the dual graviton theories into vector-valued $p$-form electrodynamics and is controlled by the Reidemeister torsion, Ray-Singer torsion and Euler characteristic of the cotangent bundle. Under the proposed instanton prescription the duality anomaly vanishes for an odd number of spacetime dimensions as a consequence of the celebrated Cheeger-M\"uller theorem. In the presence of a gravitational $\theta$-term, the partition function is a modular form in direct analogy to Abelian S-duality for Maxwell theory.</description>

      <title>Upscaling the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for incompressible multiphase flow in inhomogeneous porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a macroscopic model for the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids in inhomogeneous porous medium. At the pore scale, the flow is governed by the fully Navier-Stokes equations while the evolution of the phase interface is captured by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. Using the volume averaging method, the upscaled equations describing the averaged behavior of two fluids at the Darcy scale are obtained, with unclosed terms related to spatial deviations. Then, spatial derivations are carefully modeled up to some undetermined coefficients, which could be evaluated by solving simplified closure problems in each representative volume element. In particular, the wetting behavior is incorporated into the averaged chemical potential. The differences between the proposed equations and the empirical two-phase Darcy-type models are discussed. Finally, a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann model for the averaged equations is presented, and numerical results demonstrate the abilities of the proposed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the simplest non-trivial local composite operators in the massless Sine-Gordon model, which are $\partial_\mu \phi \, \partial_\nu \phi$ and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We show that even in the finite regime $\beta^2 &lt; 4 \pi$ of the theory, these operators need additional renormalisation (beyond the free-field normal-ordering) at each order in perturbation theory. We further prove convergence of the renormalised perturbative series for their expectation values, both in the Euclidean signature and in Minkowski space-time, and for the latter in an arbitrary Hadamard state. Lastly, we show that one must add a quantum correction (proportional to $\hbar$) to the renormalised stress tensor to obtain a conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>The majorant method for the fermionic effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling Polchinski's equation by the solution of an associate Hamilton-Jacobi equation which determines a norm majorant for the fermionic effective action. This method, referred to as the majorant method, was first introduced by D. Brydges and J. Wright in 1988, but its original formulation contains a gap which has never been addressed. We overcome this gap and show that the majorant equation and its existence condition are analogous to the ones originally obtained by Brydges and Wright. As an application of the method, we investigate a fermion model with a local quartic interaction.</description>

      <title>A network based approach for unbalanced optimal transport on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach to address the dynamic unbalanced optimal transport problem on surfaces with point cloud representation. For surfaces with point cloud representation, traditional method is difficult to apply due to the difficulty of mesh generating. Neural network is easy to implement even for complicate geometry. Moreover, instead of solving the original dynamic formulation, we consider the Hamiltonian flow approach, i.e. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system. Based on this approach, we can exploit mathematical structure of the optimal transport to construct the neural network and the loss function can be simplified. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for surfaces with different geometry. We also test the method for point cloud with noise, which shows stability of this method. This method is also easy to generalize to diverse range of problems.</description>

      <title>Solving Unbalanced Optimal Transport on Point Cloud by Tangent Radial Basis Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem on surfaces represented by point clouds. Based on alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, the original UOT problem can be solved by an iteration consists of three steps. The key ingredient is to solve a Poisson equation on point cloud which is solved by tangent radial basis function (TRBF) method. The proposed TRBF method requires only the point cloud and normal vectors to discretize the Poisson equation which simplify the computation significantly. Numerical experiments conducted on point clouds with varying geometry and topology demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Transport models for wave propagation in scattering media with nonlinear absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the propagation of high-frequency waves in highly-scattering media where physical absorption of a nonlinear nature occurs. Using the classical tools of the Wigner transform and multiscale analysis, we derive semilinear radiative transport models for the phase-space intensity and the diffusive limits of such transport models. As an application, we consider an inverse problem for the semilinear transport equation, where we reconstruct the absorption coefficients of the equation from a functional of its solution. We obtain a uniqueness result on the inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Capacity threshold for the Ising perceptron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_*(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-matter equations with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study massless solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to different matter models with a magnetic field and a conformal gauge singularity assuming spatial homogeneity with three commuting spatial translations. We show that there are no solutions in the case that the matter model is a radiation fluid. If the matter is described via kinetic theory we obtain that there exist unique solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system and the Einstein-Boltzmann system for a certain range of soft potentials. For both the Vlasov and the Boltzmann case we also obtain asymptotic expansions close to the initial conformal gauge singularity.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Miura transformation in bidifferential calculus and a vectorial Darboux transformation for the Fokas-Lenells equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a general result of bidifferential calculus and recent results of other authors, a vectorial binary Darboux transformation is derived for the first member of the "negative" part of the potential Kaup-Newell hierarchy, which is a system of two coupled Fokas-Lenells equations. Miura transformations are found from the latter to the first member of the negative part of the AKNS hierarchy and also to its "pseudodual". The reduction to the Fokas-Lenells equation is implemented and exact solutions with a plane wave seed generated.</description>
