      <title>Asymptotics in Wasserstein Distance for Empirical Measures of Markov Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce some recent progresses on the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance for empirical measures of Markov processes. For diffusion processes on compact manifolds possibly with reflecting or killing boundary conditions, the sharp convergence rate as well as renormalization limits are presented in terms of the dimension of the manifold and the spectrum of the generator. For general ergodic Markov processes, explicit estimates are presented for the convergence rate by using a nice reference diffusion process, which are illustrated by some typical examples. Finally, some techniques are introduced to estimate the Wasserstein distance of empirical measures.</description>

      <title>Classification of the limit shape for 1+1-dimensional FPP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified model of planar first passage percolation where weights along vertical edges are deterministic. We show that the limit shape has a flat edge in the vertical direction if and only if the random distribution of the horizontal edges has an atom at the infimum of its support. Furthermore, we present bounds on the upper and lower derivative of the time constant.</description>

      <title>Graphon-Theoretic Approach to Central Limit Theorems for $\epsilon$-Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for the sum of $\epsilon$-independent random variables, extending both the classical and free probability setting. Central to our approach is the use of graphon limits to characterize the limiting distribution, which depends on the asymptotic structure of the underlying graphs governing $\epsilon$-independence. This framework yields a range of exotic limit laws, interpolating between free and classical cases and allowing for mixtures such as free and classical convolutions of the semi-circle and Gaussian distributions. We provide a complete characterization of the limiting law, captured as the distribution of an operator on the full Fock space. We extend our main result to the multivariate setting as well as the non-identically distributed case. The proof provides insights into the combinatorial structure of $\epsilon$-independence, shedding light on a natural connection between the graph of crossings of the partitions involved and the graphon limit of the graphs of $\epsilon$-independence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the generalized Derrida-Retaux recursive model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the max-type recursive model introduced by Hu and Shi (J. Stat. Phys., 2018), which generalizes the model of Derrida and Retaux (J. Stat. Phys., 2014). We show that the class of geometric-type distributions are preserved by the model with geometric offspring distribution. The key result is a characterization for the long-time asymptotic behavior of the marginal distributions. From this result, we derive the conditional limit law and the asymptotics of the sustainability probability and the first moment in the critical case.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of killed Feynman-Kac semigroups with singular Schr{\"o}dinger potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the compactness and the long time behavior of killed Feynman-Kac semigroups of various processes arising from statistical physics with very general singular Schr{\"o}dinger potentials. The processes we consider cover a large class of processes used in statistical physics, with strong links with quantum mechanics and (local or not) Schr{\"o}dinger operators (including e.g. fractional Laplacians). For instance we consider solutions to elliptic differential equations, L{\'e}vy processes, the kinetic Langevin process with locally Lipschitz gradient fields, and systems of interacting L{\'e}vy particles. Our analysis relies on a Perron-Frobenius type theorem derived in a previous work [A. Guillin, B. Nectoux, L. Wu, 2020 J. Eur. Math. Soc.] for Feller kernels and on the tools introduced in [L. Wu, 2004, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] to compute bounds on the essential spectral radius of a bounded nonnegative kernel.</description>

      <title>Connectivity of the adjacency graph of complementary components of the SLE fan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $h$ is an instance of the Gaussian free field (GFF) on a simply connected domain $D \subseteq {\mathbf C}$ and $x,y \in \partial D$ are distinct. Fix $\kappa \in (0,4)$ and for each $\theta \in {\mathbf R}$ let $\eta_\theta$ be the flow line of $h$ from $x$ to $y$. Recall that for $\theta_1 &lt; \theta_2$ the fan ${\mathbf F}(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ of flow lines of $h$ from $x$ to $y$ is the closure of the union of $\eta_\theta$ as $\theta$ varies in any fixed countable dense subset of $[\theta_1,\theta_2]$. We show that the adjacency graph of components of $D \setminus {\mathbf F}(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ is a.s. connected, meaning it a.s. holds that for every pair $U,V$ of components there exist components $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ so that $U_1 = U$, $U_n = V$, and $\partial U_i \cap \partial U_{i+1} \neq \emptyset$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$. We further show that ${\mathbf F}(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ a.s. determines the flow lines used in its construction. That is, for each $\theta \in [\theta_1,\theta_2]$ we prove that $\eta_\theta$ is a.s. determined by ${\mathbf F}(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ as a set.</description>

      <title>A new maximal regularity for parabolic equations and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder--Dini and Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R};{\mathcal C}_{\vartheta,\varsigma}^{\alpha,\rho}({\mathbb R}^n))$ ($\vartheta\in \{l,b\}, \, \varsigma\in \{d,s,c,w\}$, $p\in (1,+\infty]$ and $\alpha\in [0,1)$), and then use a vector-valued Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund theorem to establish the maximal Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder--Dini and Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder regularity for a class of parabolic equations. As an application, we obtain the unique strong solvability of the following stochastic differential equation \begin{eqnarray*} X_{s,t}(x)=x+\int\limits_s^tb(r,X_{s,r}(x))dr+W_t-W_{s}, \ \ t\in [s,T], \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \ s\in [0,T], \end{eqnarray*} for the low regularity growing drift in critical Lebesgue--H\"{o}lder--Dini spaces $L^p([0,T];{\mathcal C}^{\frac{2}{p}-1,\rho}_{l,d}({\mathbb R}^n;{\mathbb R}^n))$ ($p\in (1,2]$), where $\{W_t\}_{0\leq t\leq T}$ is a $n$-dimensional standard Wiener process. In particular, when $p=2$ we give a partially affirmative answer to a longstanding open problem, which was proposed by Krylov and R\"{o}ckner for $b\in L^2([0,T];L^\infty({\mathbb R}^n;{\mathbb R}^n))$ based upon their work ({\em Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 131(2): 154--196, 2005}).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the computation of sensitivities with respect to spot of path dependent financial derivatives by means of path weighting. We propose explicit path weighting formula and variance reduction adjustment in order to address the large variance happening when the first simulation time step is small. We also propose a covariance inflation technique to addresses the degenerator case when the covariance matrix is singular. The stock dynamics we consider is given in a general functional form, which includes the classical Black-Scholes model, the implied distribution model, and the local volatility model.</description>

      <title>Forest Fire Model on $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ with Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the forest fire model on $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with ignition at zero only, studied in [arXiv:0907.1821]. Unlike that model, we allow delays in the spread of the fires as well as the non-zero burning time of individual ``trees''. We obtain some general properties for this model, which cover, among others, the phenomena of an ``infinite fire'', not present in the original model.</description>

Abstract: We continue the program initiated in [J. Funct.

We then provide some examples on and beyond stratified Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Height-offset variables and pinning at infinity for gradient Gibbs measures on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general theory of height-offset variables and their properties for nearest-neighbor integer-valued gradient models on trees. This notion goes back to Sheffield [25], who realized that such tail-measurable variables can be used to associate to gradient Gibbs measures also proper Gibbs measures, via the procedure of pinning at infinity. On the constructive side, our theory incorporates the existence of height-offset variables, regularity properties of their Lebesgue densities and concentration properties of the associated Gibbs measure. On the pathological side, we show that pinning at infinity necessarily comes at a cost. This phenomenon will be analyzed on the levels of translation invariance, the tree-indexed Markov chain property, and extremality. The scope of our theory incorporates free measures, and also height-periodic measures of period 2, assuming only finite second moments of the transfer operator which encodes the nearest neighbor interaction. Our proofs are based on investigations of the respective martingale limits, past and future tail-decompositions, and infinite product representations for moment generating functions.</description>

      <title>Capacity of loop-erased random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capacity of loop-erased random walk (LERW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. For $d\geq4$, we prove a strong law of large numbers and give explicit expressions for the limit in terms of the non-intersection probabilities of a simple random walk and a two-sided LERW. Along the way, we show that four-dimensional LERW is ergodic. For $d=3$, we show that the scaling limit of the capacity of LERW is random. We show that the capacity of the first $n$ steps of LERW is of order $n^{1/\beta}$, with $\beta$ the growth exponent of three-dimensional LERW. We express the scaling limit of the capacity of LERW in terms of the capacity of Kozma's scaling limit of LERW.</description>

      <title>The Aldous--Hoover Theorem in Categorical Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Aldous-Hoover Theorem concerns an infinite matrix of random variables whose distribution is invariant under finite permutations of rows and columns. It states that, up to equality in distribution, each random variable in the matrix can be expressed as a function only depending on four key variables: one common to the entire matrix, one that encodes information about its row, one that encodes information about its column, and a fourth one specific to the matrix entry.
  We state and prove the theorem within a category-theoretic approach to probability, namely the theory of Markov categories. This makes the proof more transparent and intuitive when compared to measure-theoretic ones. A key role is played by a newly identified categorical property, the Cauchy--Schwarz axiom, which also facilitates a new synthetic de Finetti Theorem.
  We further provide a variant of our proof using the ordered Markov property and the d-separation criterion, both generalized from Bayesian networks to Markov categories. We expect that this approach will facilitate a systematic development of more complex results in the future, such as categorical approaches to hierarchical exchangeability.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for mean-field queueing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field limits have been used now as a standard tool in approximations, including for networks with a large number of nodes. Statistical inference on mean-filed models has attracted more attention recently mainly due to the rapid emergence of data-driven systems. However, studies reported in the literature have been mainly limited to continuous models. In this paper, we initiate a study of statistical inference on discrete mean-field models (or jump processes) in terms of a well-known and extensively studied model, known as the power-of-L, or the supermarket model, to demonstrate how to deal with new challenges in discrete models. We focus on system parameter estimation based on the observations of system states at discrete time epochs over a finite period. We show that by harnessing the weak convergence results developed for the supermarket model in the literature, an asymptotic inference scheme based on an approximate least squares estimation can be obtained from the mean-field limiting equation. Also, by leveraging the law of large numbers alongside the central limit theorem, the consistency of the estimator and its asymptotic normality can be established when the number of servers and the number of observations go to infinity. Moreover, numerical results for the power-of-two model are provided to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Conditional gene genealogies given the population pedigree for a diploid Moran model with selfing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic model of a population with overlapping generations and arbitrary levels of self-fertilization versus outcrossing. We study how the global graph of reproductive relationships, or pedigree, influences the genealogical relationships of a sample of two gene copies at a genetic locus. Specifically, we consider a diploid Moran model with constant population size $N$ over time, in which a proportion of offspring are produced by selfing. We show that the conditional distribution of the pairwise coalescence time at a single locus given the random pedigree converges to a limit law as $N$ tends to infinity. This limit law generally differs from the corresponding traditional result obtained by averaging over all possible pedigrees. We describe three different behaviors in the limit depending on the relative strengths, from large to small, of selfing versus outcrossing: partial selfing, limited outcrossing, and negligible outcrossing. In the case of partial selfing, coalescence times are related to the Kingman coalescent, similar to what is found in traditional analyses. In the the case of limited outcrossing, the retained pedigree information forms a random graph coming from a fragmentation-coagulation process, with the limiting coalescence times given by the meeting times of random walks on this graph. In the case of negligible outcrossing, which represents complete or nearly complete selfing, coalescence times are determined entirely by the fixed times to common ancestry of diploid individuals in the pedigree.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free Measures of Association based on Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study a class of nonparametric, yet interpretable measures of association between two random vectors $X$ and $Y$ taking values in $\mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ respectively ($d_1, d_2\ge 1$). These nonparametric measures -- defined using the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces coupled with optimal transport -- capture the strength of dependence between $X$ and $Y$ and have the property that they are 0 if and only if the variables are independent and 1 if and only if one variable is a measurable function of the other. Further, these population measures can be consistently estimated using the general framework of geometric graphs which include $k$-nearest neighbor graphs and minimum spanning trees. Additionally, these measures can also be readily used to construct an exact finite sample distribution-free test of mutual independence between $X$ and $Y$. In fact, as far as we are aware, these are the only procedures that possess all the above mentioned desirable properties. The correlation coefficient proposed in Dette et al. (2013), Chatterjee (2021), Azadkia and Chatterjee (2021), at the population level, can be seen as a special case of this general class of measures.</description>

      <title>On free energy of non-convex multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [arXiv:2311.08980], it was shown that if the limit of the free energy in a non-convex vector spin glass model exists, it must be a critical value of a certain functional. In this work, we extend this result to multi-species spin glass models with non-convex interactions, where spins from different species may lie in distinct vector spaces. Since the species proportions may be irrational and the existence of the limit of the free energy is not generally known, non-convex multi-species models cannot be approximated by vector spin models in a straightforward manner, necessitating more careful treatment.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold and lognormal limit for non-linear Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For positive integers $r &gt; \ell \geq 1$, an $\ell$-cycle in an $r$-uniform hypergraph is a cycle where each edge consists of $r$ vertices and each pair of consecutive edges intersect in $\ell$ vertices. We show that for $\ell \geq 2$, a random $r$-uniform hypergraph contains a Hamilton $\ell$-cycle with high probability whenever the expected number of such cycles tends to infinity. Moreover, for $\ell = 2$, we show that the normalized number of Hamilton $2$-cycles converges to a lognormal distribution. This determines the exact threshold for the appearance of non-linear Hamilton cycles in random hypergraphs, confirming a conjecture of Narayanan and Schacht.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism Theorems between Models of Mixed Choice (Revised)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the so-called powercone models of mixed non-deterministic and probabilistic choice proposed by Tix, Keimel, Plotkin, Mislove, Ouaknine, Worrell, Morgan, and McIver, to our own models of previsions. Under suitable topological assumptions, we show that they are isomorphic. We rely on Keimel's cone-theoretic variants of the classical Hahn-Banach separation theorems, using functional analytic methods, and on the Schr\"oder-Simpson Theorem. Lemma 3.4 in the original 2017 version, published at MSCS, had a wrong proof, and we prove a repaired, albeit slightly less general version here.</description>

      <title>Stopping Times Occurring Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09458v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stopping times are used in applications to model random arrivals. A standard assumption in many models is that they are conditionally independent, given an underlying filtration. This is a widely useful assumption, but there are circumstances where it seems to be unnecessarily strong. We use a modified Cox construction along with the bivariate exponential introduced by Marshall and Olkin (1967) to create a family of stopping times, which are not necessarily conditionally independent, allowing for a positive probability for them to be equal. We show that our initial construction only allows for positive dependence between stopping times, but we also propose a joint distribution that allows for negative dependence while preserving the property of non-zero probability of equality. We indicate applications to modeling COVID-19 contagion (and epidemics in general), civil engineering, and to credit risk.</description>

      <title>Limit laws for random walks in a dynamic path-cone mixing random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of a random walk whose evolution is dependent on the state of an itself dynamically evolving environment. In particular, we extend our previous results in [Bethuelsen and V\"ollering, 2016] and prove a strong law of large numbers and large deviation estimates assuming that the dynamic environment is "path-cone"-mixing. Under a mild assumption on the decay rate of this mixing property we further obtain a functional central limit theorem under the annealed law. Our method of proofs rest on the study of the so-called local environment process and general results for $\phi$-mixing stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Mean reflected Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of mean reflected McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation, which extends the equation proposed by \cite{briand2020particles} by allowing the solution's distribution to not only constrain its behavior, but also affect the diffusion and drift coefficients. We establish the existence and uniqueness results of this class, investigate the propagation of chaos, and examine the stability properties with respect to the initial condition, coefficients, and driving process. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof of a Fredlin-Wentzell type large deviations principle using the weak convergence method. We also demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure and employ the coupling by change of measure method to prove log-Harnack inequality and shift Harnack inequality. Our study sheds light on the properties and behaviors of these reflected Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation and contributes to the ongoing research in this field.</description>

      <title>A criterion for absolute continuity relative to the law of fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the sum of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and an absolutely continuous and adapted drift process. We establish a simple criterion that guarantees that the law of $X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original fractional Brownian motion. For $H&lt;1/2$, the trajectories of the derivative of the drift need to be bounded by an almost surely finite random variable; for $H&gt;1/2$, they need to satisfy a H\"older condition with some exponent larger than $2H-1$. These are almost-sure conditions, and no expectation requirements are imposed. For the case in which $X$ arises as the solution of a nonlinear stochastic integral equation driven by fractional Brownian motion, we provide a simple criterion on the drift coefficient under which the law of $X$ is automatically equivalent to the one of fractional Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: For skew Brownian motion with two-valued drift, adopting a perturbation approach we find expressions of its potential densities. As applications, we recover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. We also compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian motions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by approximating the cumulative distribution function and discussing their risk measurement application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCBs) using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercise time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients from the current time to time zero. This process ultimately determines the CCB price. We then apply this pricing method in simulations and evaluate an underpriced strategy: taking long positions in the 10 most undervalued CCBs and rebalancing daily. The results show that this strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark double-low strategy. In practice, CCB issuers often use a downward adjustment clause to prevent financial distress when a put provision is triggered. Therefore, we model the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event that triggers the put provision, thereby integrating it with the put provision in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Copula-Linked Parallel ICA: A Method for Coupling Structural and Functional MRI brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different brain imaging modalities offer unique insights into brain function and structure. Combining them enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the benefits of this approach. Since sMRI lacks temporal data, existing fusion methods often compress fMRI temporal information into summary measures, sacrificing rich temporal dynamics. Motivated by the observation that covarying networks are identified in both sMRI and resting-state fMRI, we developed a novel fusion method, by combining deep learning frameworks, copulas and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method estimates independent sources for each modality and links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a copula-based model for more flexible integration of temporal and spatial data. We tested CLiP-ICA using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our results showed that CLiP-ICA effectively captures both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. It revealed more meaningful components and fewer artifacts, addressing the long-standing issue of optimal model order in ICA. CLiP-ICA also detected complex functional connectivity patterns across stages of cognitive decline, with cognitively normal subjects generally showing higher connectivity in sensorimotor and visual networks compared to patients with Alzheimer, along with patterns suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Yield Curve with VIX as Stochastic Volatility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Next, we prove long-term stability for this discrete-time model and its continuous-time version. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S\&amp;P 500 stock market index. It is surprising that this volatility, created for the stock market, also works for Treasury bonds. Since total returns of zero-coupon bonds can be easily found from these principal components, we prove long-term stability for total returns in discrete time.</description>

      <title>A Bicriterion Concentration Inequality and Prophet Inequalities for $k$-Fold Matroid Unions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate prophet inequalities with competitive ratios approaching $1$, seeking to generalize $k$-uniform matroids. We first show that large girth does not suffice: for all $k$, there exists a matroid of girth $\geq k$ and a prophet inequality instance on that matroid whose optimal competitive ratio is $\frac{1}{2}$. Next, we show $k$-fold matroid unions do suffice: we provide a prophet inequality with competitive ratio $1-O(\sqrt{\frac{\log k}{k}})$ for any $k$-fold matroid union. Our prophet inequality follows from an online contention resolution scheme.
  The key technical ingredient in our online contention resolution scheme is a novel bicriterion concentration inequality for arbitrary monotone $1$-Lipschitz functions over independent items which may be of independent interest. Applied to our particular setting, our bicriterion concentration inequality yields "Chernoff-strength" concentration for a $1$-Lipschitz function that is not (approximately) self-bounding.</description>
