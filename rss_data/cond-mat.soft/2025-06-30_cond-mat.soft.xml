      <title>Hyperuniformity in ternary fluid mixtures: the role of wetting and hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in multicomponent fluids is central to understanding the organization of complex materials and biological structures. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations offer a robust framework for modeling such systems, capturing both diffusive dynamics and hydrodynamic interactions. In this work, we investigate hyperuniformity, characterized by suppressed large-scale density fluctuations, in ternary fluid mixtures governed by the ternary CHNS equations. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations, we systematically explore the influence of wetting conditions and hydrodynamic effects on emergent hyperuniformity. Similar to binary systems we observe that the presence of hydrodynamics weakens the hyperuniform characteristics. However, also the wetting properties have an effect. We find that in partial wetting regimes, all three components exhibit comparable degrees of hyperuniformity. In contrast, for complete wetting scenarios, where one component preferentially wets the other two, the wetting component displays a significant reduction in hyperuniformity relative to the others. These findings suggest that wetting asymmetry can act as a control parameter for spatial order in multicomponent fluids.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of disclination emergence in 3D active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous creation of disclinations is a defining characteristic of active nematics, which is rarely observed in equilibrium systems or other active matter systems. Thus, understanding the mechanics of disclinations is crucial for developing reliable continuum theories and practical applications. In this work, we explore this intrinsic mechanics by performing large-scale 3D simulations of a particle-based model of active semiflexible filaments. We investigate the effects of filament stiffness and activity on the collective behavior of active nematics. Analysis of the steady state and the topological properties of initial disclination loops reveals that the system is governed by a single parameter, an activity-dependent effective stiffness. Then, we develop a method to visualize director field orientations in a physically transparent manner during the formation of disclination loops. Based on this, we establish a unified theory for the mechanics of disclination emergence, across the range of bend and twist. This disclination analysis framework can also be applied to diverse other 3D liquid crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Actively induced supercoiling can slow down plasmid solutions by trapping the threading entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the topology of ring polymers as a design motif in functional nanomaterials is becoming a promising direction in the field of soft matter. For example, the ring topology of DNA plasmids prevents the relaxation of excess twist introduced to the polymer, instead resulting in helical supercoiled structures. In equilibrium semi-dilute solutions, tightly supercoiled rings relax faster than their torsionally relaxed counterparts, since the looser conformations of the latter allow for rings to thread through each other and entrain via entanglements. Here we use molecular simulations to explore a non-equilibrium scenario, in which a supercoiling agent, akin to gyrase enzymes, rapidly induces supercoiling in the suspensions of relaxed plasmids. The activity of the agent not only alters the conformational topology from open to branched, but also locks-in threaded rings into supramolecular clusters, which relax very slowly. Ultimately, our work shows how the polymer topology under non-equilibrium conditions can be leveraged to tune dynamic behavior of macromolecular systems, suggesting a pathway to novel class of driven materials glassified by activity.</description>

      <title>Energetic variational modeling of active nematics: coupling the Toner-Tu model with ATP hydrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent energetic variational model for active nematics driven by ATP hydrolysis, with a focus on the coupling between chemical reactions and mechanical dynamics. Extending the classical Toner-Tu framework, we introduce a chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism in which the self-advection and polarization dynamics are modulated by the ATP hydrolysis rate. The model is derived using an energetic variational approach that integrates both chemical free energy and mechanical energy into a unified energy-dissipation law. The reaction rate equation explicitly incorporates mechanical feedback, revealing how active transport and alignment interactions influence chemical fluxes and vice versa. This formulation not only preserves consistency with nonequilibrium thermodynamics but also provides a transparent pathway for modeling energy transduction in active systems. We also present numerical simulations demonstrating how ATP consumption drives the merging of topological defects and enables the system to escape a quasi-equilibrium, a phenomenon not observed in passive nematic systems. This framework offers new insights into energy transduction and regulation mechanisms in biologically related active systems.</description>

      <title>Tension-Induced Soft Stress and Viscoelastic Bending in Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Enhanced Energy Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected materials that harness elastic snap-through buckling can trap energy reversibly. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit excellent dissipation capabilities due to polymer network viscoelasticity and rate-dependent soft stress behavior associated with mesogen rotation. Incorporating LCEs into buckling lattice structures enhances energy absorption; however, conventional design cannot take advantage of the dissipation mechanism associated with mesogen rotation because buckling occurs at strains below the threshold of the soft stress response. In this study, we investigate tension-induced mesogen rotation as an additional dissipation mechanism in horizontal members of structures composed of tilted LCE beams under compression. Viscoelastic properties of LCEs with two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a nonlinear viscoelastic user-defined element was implemented in Abaqus/Standard to capture finite-strain behavior, including soft stress effects. Simulations and experiments revealed a non-monotonic dependence of energy dissipation on the thickness ratio between horizontal and tilted LCE members. Optimized structures with stretchable horizontal bars dissipated 2-3 times more energy than rigid-bar counterparts by balancing tension-driven soft stress with viscoelastic beam bending. Energy contributions from mesogen rotation and polymer network viscoelasticity were quantified. These findings inform the design strategies for LCE-based architected materials to enhance dissipation.</description>

      <title>Decoding Noise in Nanofluidic Systems: Adsorption versus Diffusion Signatures in Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption processes play a fundamental role in molecular transport through nanofluidic systems, but their signatures in measured signals are often hard to distinguish from other processes like diffusion. In this paper, we derive an expression for the power spectral density (PSD) of particle number fluctuations in a channel, accounting for diffusion and adsorption/desorption to a wall. Our model, validated by Brownian dynamics simulations, is set in a minimal yet adaptable geometry, allowing us to eliminate the effects of specific geometries. We identify distinct signatures in the PSD as a function of frequency $f$, including $1/f^{3/2}$ and $1/f^{1/2}$ scalings related to diffusive entrance and re-entrance effects, and a $1/f^2$ scaling associated with adsorption. These scalings appear in key predicted quantities -- the total number of particles in the channel and the number of adsorbed or unadsorbed particles -- and can dominate or combine in non-trivial ways depending on parameter values. Notably, when there is a separation of timescales between diffusion within the channel and adsorption/desorption times, the PSD can exhibit two distinct slopes in some of the predicted quantities. We provide a phase diagram to classify experimental systems based on predicted PSD shapes. These PSDs reflect measured properties in physical systems on the nano- and micro-scale, such as ion channels, nanopores, and electrochemical sensors, potentially offering insights into noisy experimental data.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hard Sphere and Spherocylinder Mixtures -- Scaled Particle Theory and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the literature on scaled particle theory (SPT) and its extensions and discuss results applied to describe the thermodynamics of hard particle mixtures. After explaining the basic concepts of scaled particle theory to compute the free energy of immersing a particle into a mixture, examples are discussed for the simple case of a hard sphere dispersion and the free volume fraction of ghost spheres in a hard sphere dispersion. Next, the concept is applied to mixtures, and general expressions are shown that relate the free volume fraction in mixtures to the key thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential(s) and (osmotic) pressure. Subsequently, it is revealed how these concepts can be extended towards multi-component systems. It is shown that free volume fractions provide chemical potentials and total pressure of multi-component mixtures, and thereby yield the full equation of state. We present novel results for ternary particle dispersions composed of hard spherocylinders and two types of hard spheres differing in size. Throughout, we show the accuracy of SPT by comparing the results with those of Monte Carlo computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</description>

      <title>DNA Unzipping Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</description>

      <title>Incremental dynamics of prestressed viscoelastic solids and its applications in shear wave elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a promising imaging modality for mechanical characterization of tissues, offering biomarkers with potential for early and precise diagnosis. While various methods have been developed to extract mechanical parameters from shear wave characteristics, their relationships in viscoelastic materials under prestress remain poorly understood. Here, we present a generalized incremental dynamics theory for finite-strain viscoelastic solids. The theory derives small-amplitude viscoelastic wave motions in a material under static pre-stress. The formalism is compatible with a range of existing constitutive models, including both hyperelasticity and viscoelasticity--such as the combination of Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) and Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) models used in this study. We validate the theory through experiments and numerical simulations on prestressed soft materials and biological tissues, using both optical coherence elastography and ultrasound elastography. The theoretical predictions closely match experimental dispersion curves over a broad frequency range and accurately capture the effect of prestress. Furthermore, the framework reveals the relationships among shear wave phase velocity, attenuation, and principal stresses, enabling prestress quantification in viscoelastic solids without prior knowledge of constitutive parameters. This generalized acousto-viscoelastic formalism is particularly well-suited for high-frequency, high-resolution SWE in tissues under prestress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>The polyhedral structure underlying programmable self-assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a significant part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of the polyhedral structure and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover fundamental physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse-design, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.</description>

Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Interactions that induce alignment are essential for flocking; however, alignment alone is generally insufficient to maintain group cohesion in the presence of noise, leading traditional models to introduce artificial boundaries or explicit attractive forces. Here, we propose a model that achieves cohesive flocking through purely alignment-based interactions by introducing predictive alignment, in which agents reorient to maximize alignment with the prevailing orientations of their anticipated future neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bacteria optimize tumble bias to strategically navigate surface constraints</title>

Abstract: In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>

Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on a saddle-point analysis in the limit of high density and weak interactions between the particles, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute exactly the three- and four-point density correlation functions. This result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki equation beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>

Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that their internal correlation time is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of the malaria parasites.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using multiparticle collision dynamics simulations, we investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of a model swimmer designed to mimic the isolated flagellar apparatus ($FA$) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We represent the $FA$ as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs, with two traveling waves originating at its center and propagating in opposite directions along the chain. Our simulations show that an $FA$ whose beat pattern has non-zero mean curvature sustains ballistic motion for several hundred beats before transitioning to a diffusion-dominated regime via rotational diffusion. In contrast, a flagellar apparatus with zero mean curvature ($FA_0$) -- generates mirror-symmetric deformations and fails to achieve net propulsion. Both the active $FA$ and $FA_0$ exhibit orientational autocorrelation functions that decay exponentially -- matching those of their inactive counterparts -- indicating that active beating does not influence the FA's rotational diffusion. Driving the two flagellar arms at different frequencies reproduces the epitrochoid-like trajectory observed experimentally. Finally, hydrodynamic interactions between two $FA$s give rise to co-moving bound pairs in either parallel or antiparallel configurations, with their stability governed by the phase difference of the curvature waves. Together, our results establish a versatile model microswimmer with tunable dynamics -- offering a blueprint for the rational design of artificial, flagella-driven microswimmers. </description>
