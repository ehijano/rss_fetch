      <title>Democratic Resilience and Sociotechnical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions.</description>

      <title>Detection of Rumors and Their Sources in Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</description>

      <title>Using LLMs to Infer Non-Binary COVID-19 Sentiments of Chinese Micro-bloggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying public sentiment during crises is crucial for understanding how opinions and sentiments shift, resulting in polarized societies. We study Weibo, the most popular microblogging site in China, using posts made during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. The study period includes the pre-COVID-19 stage, the outbreak stage, and the early stage of epidemic prevention. We use Llama 3 8B, a Large Language Model, to analyze users' sentiments on the platform by classifying them into positive, negative, sarcastic, and neutral categories. Analyzing sentiment shifts on Weibo provides insights into how social events and government actions influence public opinion. This study contributes to understanding the dynamics of social sentiments during health crises, fulfilling a gap in sentiment analysis for Chinese platforms. By examining these dynamics, we aim to offer valuable perspectives on digital communication's role in shaping society's responses during unprecedented global challenges.</description>

      <title>One Node One Model: Featuring the Missing-Half for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09902v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing graph clustering methods primarily focus on exploiting topological structure, often neglecting the ``missing-half" node feature information, especially how these features can enhance clustering performance. This issue is further compounded by the challenges associated with high-dimensional features. Feature selection in graph clustering is particularly difficult because it requires simultaneously discovering clusters and identifying the relevant features for these clusters. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm called ``one node one model", which builds an exclusive model for each node and defines the node label as a combination of predictions for node groups. Specifically, the proposed ``Feature Personalized Graph Clustering (FPGC)" method identifies cluster-relevant features for each node using a squeeze-and-excitation block, integrating these features into each model to form the final representations. Additionally, the concept of feature cross is developed as a data augmentation technique to learn low-order feature interactions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FPGC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods. Moreover, the plug-and-play nature of our method provides a versatile solution to enhance GNN-based models from a feature perspective.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for the bullying dynamics in schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a mathematical model to understand the dynamics of bullying in schools. The model considers a population divided into four groups: susceptible individuals, bullies, individuals exposed to bullying, and violent individuals. Transitions between these states occur at rates designed to capture the complex interactions among students, influenced by factors such as romantic rejection, conflicts with peers and teachers, and other school-related challenges. These interactions can escalate into bullying and violent behavior. The model also incorporates the role of parents and school administrators in mitigating bullying through intervention strategies. The results suggest that bullying can be effectively controlled if anti-bullying programs implemented by schools are sufficiently robust. Additionally, the conditions under which bullying persists are explored.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overlapping Community Search (OCS) identifies nodes that interact with multiple communities based on a specified query. Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Urban Mobility Trends using Cellular Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of urban areas intensifies the need for sustainable, efficient transportation infrastructure and mobility systems, driving initiatives to enhance infrastructure and public transit while reducing traffic congestion and emissions. By utilizing real-world data, a data-driven approach can provide crucial insights for urban mobility planning and decision-making. This study explores the efficacy of leveraging telecoms data from cellular network signals for studying crowd movement patterns, focusing on Trondheim, Norway. It examines routing reports to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of various transportation routes and modes. A data preprocessing and feature engineering framework was developed to process raw routing reports for historical analysis. This enabled the examination of geospatial trends and temporal patterns, including a comparative analysis of various transportation modes, along with public transit usage. Specific routes and areas were analyzed in-depth to compare their mobility patterns with the broader city context. The study highlights the potential of cellular network data as a resource for shaping urban transportation and mobility systems. By identifying deficiencies and potential improvements, city planners and stakeholders can foster more sustainable and effective transportation and mobility solutions.</description>
