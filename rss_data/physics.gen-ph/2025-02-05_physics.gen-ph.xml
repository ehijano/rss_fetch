      <title>Gravitational Waves beyond the Linear Approximation and Gravitational Wave Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a relativistic field equation for the trace of the metric perturbation beyond the weak field approximation to the Einstein field equations. The dynamics is governed by a massive Klein-Gordon equation on curved space-time, where the effective mass of the field is associated with the material and the dark energy content via the cosmological term. We solve the equation in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole and show that it can be cast into an effective Schr\"odinger form with an effective geometric potential which binds the zero angular momentum states. The non-zero angular momentum states experience a positive potential peak before the event horizon pointing to gravitational waves scattering. Black holes scatter gravitational waves and thus we provide an unambiguous testable prediction of black hole existence. The Newtonian limit for this equation points to the possibility of reflecting gravitational waves at interfaces with sharp density boundary, thus opening up gravitational wave propulsion physics. We discuss this type of propulsion in the light of Newton's third law of Mechanics. Compelling questions such as the existence of quanta of this field which may account for the dark matter content are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Local Quantum Mechanical Prediction of the Singlet State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deduce the quantum mechanical prediction of $-{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$ for the singlet spin state employing local measurement functions following Bell's approach. Our derivation is corroborated through a computational simulation conducted via the Mathematica programming environment.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Mechanical Property Variability in Recycled Plastics via Bio-inspired Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating plastic waste crisis demands global action, yet mechanical recycling - currently the most prevalent strategy - remains severely underutilized. Only a small fraction of the total plastic waste is recycled in this manner, largely due to the significant variability in recycled plastics' mechanical properties. This variability stems from compositional fluctuations and impurities introduced throughout the materials' lifecycle and the recycling process, deterring industries with stringent product specifications from adopting recycled plastics on a wider scale. To overcome this challenge, we propose a composite structure inspired by nacre's microstructure - a natural material known for its exceptional mechanical performance despite its inherent randomness across multiple length scales. This bio-inspired design features stiff recycled plastic platelets ("bricks") within a soft polymeric matrix ("mortar"). We use a tension-shear-chain model to capture the deformation mechanism of the structure, and demonstrate, through a case study of commercial stretch wrap, that the proposed design reduces variability in effective elastic modulus by 89.5% and in elongation at break by 42%, while achieving the same modulus as the virgin stretch wrap material. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed bio-inspired design to enhance the mechanical performance of recycled plastics, but also demonstrate that a universally applicable, chemistry-agnostic approach can substantially broaden their applications, paving the way for sustainable plastic waste management.</description>

      <title>Covariance in Fractional Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the requirement of covariance, we propose a new approach for generalizing fractional calculus in multi-dimensional space. As a first application we calculate an approximation for the ground state energy of the fractional 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator using the Ritz variational principle.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Neutrino interaction with matter in a noninertial frame"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this comment, we obtain the complete energy levels for Dvornikov's paper, that is, the energy levels dependent on two quantum numbers, namely, the radial quantum number (given by $N$) and the angular quantum number (given by $J_z$). In particular, what motivated us to do this was the fact that the quantized energy levels for particles (fermions or bosons) in polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates depend on two quantum numbers: a radial quantum number and an angular quantum number. From this, the following question/doubt arose: Why do the energy levels in Dvornikov's paper only depend on one quantum number? That is, Where did the angular quantum number given by $J_z$ go? So, using Studenikin's paper as a starting point (as well as others in the literature), we write one of the equations from Dvornikov's paper in matrix form. Next, we use the four-component Dirac spinor and obtain a set/system of four coupled first-order differential equations. From the first two equations with $m\to 0$ (massless neutrino or ultrarelativistic regime), we obtain a (compact) second-order differential equation for the last two spinor components. So, solving this equation, we obtain the neutrino energy levels, which explicitly depend on both $N$ and $J_z$. Finally, we note that for $J_z&gt;0$ (positive angular momentum) with $u=+1$ (component $\psi_3$), we obtain exactly the particular energy levels of Dvornikov's paper.</description>
