      <title>Light-driven modulation of proximity-enhanced functionalities in hybrid nano-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing quantum information and communication technology (qICT) requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents a novel strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C60 molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a striking 60% transient shift in the frequency of the dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode of the Cobalt. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field (an essential parameter for technological applications) our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Turbulent diffusion and dispersion in a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-body diffusion and two-body dispersion are fundamental processes in classical turbulence, governing particle mixing and transport. However, their behaviors in superfluid turbulence remain largely unexplored. In this study, we numerically investigate the diffusion and relative dispersion of quantized vortices and superfluid parcels in the 0 K limit in two distinct turbulence regimes: ultra-quantum turbulence, characterized by a randomized vortex tangle, and quasiclassical turbulence, in which locally polarized vortices create large-scale flows resembling classical turbulence. Our results reveal that while vortex segments exhibit similar superdiffusion behavior at short times in both regimes, superfluid parcels behave differently: following the same superdiffusion scaling in ultra-quantum turbulence but deviating significantly in quasiclassical turbulence. This contrast provides a key clue to the origin of short-time superdiffusion, a puzzle since its recent discovery. Additionally, we show that two-body dispersion of both vortex segments and superfluid parcels exhibits distinct scaling behaviors in ultra-quantum and quasiclassical turbulence, highlighting fundamental differences in these two turbulence regimes. Our findings bridge a critical gap in superfluid turbulence research, offering new insights into turbulent transport in inviscid quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic exchange, anisotropy and skyrmionic textures in two-dimensional FeXZ$_{2}$ (\textit{X} = Nb, Ta and \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te) ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FeNbTe$_{2}$, long known as a van der Waals metallic system, has recently been resynthesized and shown to exhibit ferromagnetic order. In this study, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we aim to provide a deeper insight into the magnetic properties of FeNbTe$_{2}$ and its related compounds (FeXZ$_{2}$, \textit{X} = Nb, Ta; \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te), in their two-dimensional form, including their non-centrosymmetric Janus counterparts. Our results indicate that these materials are energetically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, supporting the possibility of FeNbTe$_{2}$ exfoliation and potential for experimental realization of new compounds. An evolutionary structure search suggests that FeNbTe$_{2}$ retains its monoclinic symmetry in the monolayer form. Our analysis of hopping parameters obtained from Wannierization of DFT bands shows that the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions are primarily direct, while second-nearest and more distant interactions are mediated by the chalcogen atoms. Interestingly, although the second-nearest-neighbor interactions are smaller in magnitude, they appear to play a key role in determining the magnetic ordering in these systems. We also find evidence of canted magnetic anisotropy in FeXZ$_{2}$ compounds, with relatively strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and easy-axis deviations of up to 41$^\circ$ from the out-of-plane direction-an uncommon and potentially useful feature for spintronic applications. Curie temperatures estimated from Monte Carlo simulations are below room temperature but above cryogenic levels for most compounds. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that Janus-structured FeNbSeTe can host N\'eel-type skyrmions even in the absence of an external magnetic field, making this compound a suitable candidate for further experimental studies.</description>
