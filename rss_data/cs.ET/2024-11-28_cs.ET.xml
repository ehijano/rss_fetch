      <title>NeoHebbian Synapses to Accelerate Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic systems that employ advanced synaptic learning rules, such as the three-factor learning rule, require synaptic devices of increased complexity. Herein, a novel neoHebbian artificial synapse utilizing ReRAM devices has been proposed and experimentally validated to meet this demand. This synapse features two distinct state variables: a neuron coupling weight and an "eligibility trace" that dictates synaptic weight updates. The coupling weight is encoded in the ReRAM conductance, while the "eligibility trace" is encoded in the local temperature of the ReRAM and is modulated by applying voltage pulses to a physically co-located resistive heating element. The utility of the proposed synapse has been investigated using two representative tasks: first, temporal signal classification using Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) employing the e-prop algorithm, and second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for path planning tasks in feedforward networks using a modified version of the same learning rule. System-level simulations, accounting for various device and system-level non-idealities, confirm that these synapses offer a robust solution for the fast, compact, and energy-efficient implementation of advanced learning rules in neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Securing RIS-Aided Wireless Networks Against Full Duplex Active Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the physical layer security of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless network in the presence of full-duplex active eavesdropping. In this scenario, the RIS cooperates with the Base Station (BS) to transfer information to the intended user while an active attacker attempts to intercept the information through a wiretap channel. In addition, the attacker sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate user's reception of the signal and increase the eavesdropping rate. Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active and passive beamformers at the BS and RIS, respectively. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose a solution that decomposes it into two disjoint beamforming design sub-problems solved iteratively using Alternating Optimization (AO) techniques. Numerical analysis is conducted to evaluate the impacts of varying the number of active attacking antennas and elements of the RIS on the secrecy performance of the considered systems under the presence of jamming signals sent by the attacker. The results demonstrate the importance of considering the impact of jamming signals on physical layer security in RIS-aided wireless networks. Overall, our work contributes to the growing body of literature on RIS-aided wireless networks and highlights the need to address the effects of jamming and active eavesdropping signals in such systems.</description>

      <title>"Give me the code" -- Log Analysis of First-Year CS Students' Interactions With GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard in computer science (CS) education is expected to be profound. Students now have the power to generate code solutions for a wide array of programming assignments. For first-year students, this may be particularly problematic since the foundational skills are still in development and an over-reliance on generative AI tools can hinder their ability to grasp essential programming concepts. This paper analyzes the prompts used by 69 freshmen undergraduate students to solve a certain programming problem within a project assignment, without giving them prior prompt training. We also present the rules of the exercise that motivated the prompts, designed to foster critical thinking skills during the interaction. Despite using unsophisticated prompting techniques, our findings suggest that the majority of students successfully leveraged GPT, incorporating the suggested solutions into their projects. Additionally, half of the students demonstrated the ability to exercise judgment in selecting from multiple GPT-generated solutions, showcasing the development of their critical thinking skills in evaluating AI-generated code.</description>

      <title>RankMap: Priority-Aware Multi-DNN Manager for Heterogeneous Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern edge data centers simultaneously handle multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), leading to significant challenges in workload management. Thus, current management systems must leverage the architectural heterogeneity of new embedded systems to efficiently handle multi-DNN workloads. This paper introduces RankMap, a priority-aware manager specifically designed for multi-DNN tasks on heterogeneous embedded devices. RankMap addresses the extensive solution space of multi-DNN mapping through stochastic space exploration combined with a performance estimator. Experimental results show that RankMap achieves x3.6 higher average throughput compared to existing methods, while preventing DNN starvation under heavy workloads and improving the prioritization of specified DNNs by x57.5.</description>

      <title>Automating grapevine LAI features estimation with UAV imagery and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leaf area index determines crop health and growth. Traditional methods for calculating it are time-consuming, destructive, costly, and limited to a scale. In this study, we automate the index estimation method using drone image data of grapevine plants and a machine learning model. Traditional feature extraction and deep learning methods are used to obtain helpful information from the data and enhance the performance of the different machine learning models employed for the leaf area index prediction. The results showed that deep learning based feature extraction is more effective than traditional methods. The new approach is a significant improvement over old methods, offering a faster, non-destructive, and cost-effective leaf area index calculation, which enhances precision agriculture practices.</description>

      <title>FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</description>

      <title>Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environ mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</description>
