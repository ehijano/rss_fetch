      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Multi-Factor Quantitative Trading: A Cross-Sectional Portfolio Optimization Approach with Bias Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive machine learning framework for quantitative trading that achieves superior risk-adjusted returns through systematic factor engineering, real-time computation optimization, and cross-sectional portfolio construction. Our approach integrates multi-factor alpha discovery with bias correction techniques, leveraging PyTorch-accelerated factor computation and advanced portfolio optimization. The system processes 500-1000 factors derived from open-source alpha101 extensions and proprietary market microstructure signals. Key innovations include tensor-based factor computation acceleration, geometric Brownian motion data augmentation, and cross-sectional neutralization strategies. Empirical validation on Chinese A-share markets (2010-2024) demonstrates annualized returns of $20\%$ with Sharpe ratios exceeding 2.0, significantly outperforming traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals the critical importance of bias correction in factor construction and the substantial impact of cross-sectional portfolio optimization on strategy performance.

      <title>Variable annuities: A closer look at ratchet guarantees, hybrid contract designs, and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal withdrawal strategies and behavior of policyholders in a variable annuity (VA) contract with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider incorporating taxation and a ratchet mechanism for enhancing the benefit base during the life of the contract. Mathematically, this is accomplished by solving a backward dynamic programming problem associated with optimizing the discounted risk-neutral expectation of cash flows from the contract. Furthermore, reflecting traded VA contracts in the market, we consider hybrid products providing policyholders access to a cash fund which functions as an intermediate repository of earnings from the VA and earns interest at a contractually specified cash rate. We contribute to the literature by revealing several significant interactions among taxation, the cash fund, and the benefit base update mechanism. When tax rates are high, the tax-shielding effect of the cash fund, which is taxed differently from ordinary withdrawals from the VA, plays a significant role in enhancing the attractiveness of the overall contract. Furthermore, the ratchet benefit base update scheme (in contrast to the ubiquitous return-of-premium specification in the literature) tends to discourage early surrender as it provides enhanced downside market risk protection. In addition, the cash fund discourages active withdrawals, with policyholders preferring to transfer the guaranteed withdrawal amount to the cash fund to leverage the cash fund rate.</description>

      <title>Large-scale portfolio optimization with variational neural annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis applied to the S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm on portfolio optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal vs naive diversification in cryptocurrencies market: The role of transaction costs and time-varying moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically examines how several alternative modifications considered affect three aspects that determine portfolio performance (the gross return, the transaction costs, and the portfolio risk). We find that it is difficult to exploit the possible predictability of the returns of cryptocurrencies. However, the predictability of asset return volatility produces obvious economic value, although in a highly correlated cryptocurrencies market.</description>

      <title>In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratios for Linear Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how much the in-sample performance of trading strategies based on linear predictive models is reduced out-of-sample due to overfitting. More specifically, we compute the in- and out-of-sample means and variances of the corresponding PnLs and use these to derive a closed-form approximation for the corresponding Sharpe ratios. We find that the out-of-sample "replication ratio" diminishes for complex strategies with many assets based on many weak rather than a few strong trading signals, and increases when more training data is used. The substantial quantitative importance of these effects is illustrated with a simulation case study for commodity futures following the methodology of G\^arleanu and Pedersen, and an empirical case study using the dataset compiled by Goyal, Welch and Zafirov.</description>
