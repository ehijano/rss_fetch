      <title>The Unseen AI Disruptions for Power Grids: LLM-Induced Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior capability across major industries and stimulated multi-hundred-billion-dollar investment in AI-centric data centers in the next 3-5 years. This, in turn, bring the increasing concerns on sustainability and AI-related energy usage. However, there is a largely overlooked issue as challenging and critical as AI model and infrastructure efficiency: the disruptive dynamic power consumption behaviour. With fast, transient dynamics, AI infrastructure features ultra-low inertia, sharp power surge and dip, and a significant peak-idle power ratio. The power scale covers from several hundred watts to megawatts, even to gigawatts. These never-seen-before characteristics make AI a very unique load and pose threats to the power grid reliability and resilience. To reveal this hidden problem, this paper examines the scale of AI power consumption, analyzes AI transient behaviour in various scenarios, develops high-level mathematical models to depict AI workload behaviour and discusses the multifaceted challenges and opportunities they potentially bring to existing power grids. Observing the rapidly evolving machine learning (ML) and AI technologies, this work emphasizes the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to ensure reliable and sustainable AI infrastructure development, and provides a starting point for researchers and practitioners to tackle such challenges.</description>

      <title>HRA: A Multi-Criteria Framework for Ranking Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are essential for solving complex optimization problems in different fields. However, the difficulty in comparing and rating these algorithms remains due to the wide range of performance metrics and problem dimensions usually involved. On the other hand, nonparametric statistical methods and post hoc tests are time-consuming, especially when we only need to identify the top performers among many algorithms. The Hierarchical Rank Aggregation (HRA) algorithm aims to efficiently rank metaheuristic algorithms based on their performance across many criteria and dimensions. The HRA employs a hierarchical framework that begins with collecting performance metrics on various benchmark functions and dimensions. Rank-based normalization is employed for each performance measure to ensure comparability and the robust TOPSIS aggregation is applied to combine these rankings at several hierarchical levels, resulting in a comprehensive ranking of the algorithms. Our study uses data from the CEC 2017 competition to demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the HRA framework. It examines 30 benchmark functions and evaluates the performance of 13 metaheuristic algorithms across five performance indicators in four distinct dimensions. This presentation highlights the potential of the HRA to enhance the interpretation of the comparative advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms by simplifying practitioners' choices of the most appropriate algorithm for certain optimization problems.</description>
