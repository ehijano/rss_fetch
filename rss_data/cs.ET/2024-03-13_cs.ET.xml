      <title>Local Binary and Multiclass SVMs Trained on a Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used machine learning models (e.g., in remote sensing), with formulations for both classification and regression tasks. In the last years, with the advent of working quantum annealers, hybrid SVM models characterised by quantum training and classical execution have been introduced. These models have demonstrated comparable performance to their classical counterparts. However, they are limited in the training set size due to the restricted connectivity of the current quantum annealers. Hence, to take advantage of large datasets (like those related to Earth observation), a strategy is required. In the classical domain, local SVMs, namely, SVMs trained on the data samples selected by a k-nearest neighbors model, have already proven successful. Here, the local application of quantum-trained SVM models is proposed and empirically assessed. In particular, this approach allows overcoming the constraints on the training set size of the quantum-trained models while enhancing their performance. In practice, the FaLK-SVM method, designed for efficient local SVMs, has been combined with quantum-trained SVM models for binary and multiclass classification. In addition, for comparison, FaLK-SVM has been interfaced for the first time with a classical single-step multiclass SVM model (CS SVM). Concerning the empirical evaluation, D-Wave's quantum annealers and real-world datasets taken from the remote sensing domain have been employed. The results have shown the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach, but also its practical applicability in a real-world large-scale scenario.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for THz: Hardware Design and Signal Processing Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communications in the THz frequency band is an envisioned revolutionary technology for sixth Generation (6G) networks. However, such frequencies impose certain coverage and device design challenges that need to be efficiently overcome. To this end, the development of cost- and energy-efficient approaches for scaling these networks to realistic scenarios constitute a necessity. Among the recent research trends contributing to these objectives belongs the technology of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). In fact, several high-level descriptions of THz systems based on RISs have been populating the literature. Nevertheless, hardware implementations of those systems are still very scarce, and not at the scale intended for most envisioned THz scenarios. In this paper, we overview some of the most significant hardware design and signal processing challenges with THz RISs, and present a preliminary analysis of their impact on the overall link budget and system performance, conducted in the framework of the ongoing TERRAMETA project.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for the Problem of Security for Cognition in Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue -- which we term Cognitive Security -- but applied efforts have been limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address Cognitive Security is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Security, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Security, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</description>

      <title>Learning-driven Physically-aware Large-scale Circuit Gate Sizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate sizing plays an important role in timing optimization after physical design. Existing machine learning-based gate sizing works cannot optimize timing on multiple timing paths simultaneously and neglect the physical constraint on layouts. They cause sub-optimal sizing solutions and low-efficiency issues when compared with commercial gate sizing tools. In this work, we propose a learning-driven physically-aware gate sizing framework to optimize timing performance on large-scale circuits efficiently. In our gradient descent optimization-based work, for obtaining accurate gradients, a multi-modal gate sizing-aware timing model is achieved via learning timing information on multiple timing paths and physical information on multiple-scaled layouts jointly. Then, gradient generation based on the sizing-oriented estimator and adaptive back-propagation are developed to update gate sizes. Our results demonstrate that our work achieves higher timing performance improvements in a faster way compared with the commercial gate sizing tool.</description>

      <title>IAMCV Multi-Scenario Vehicle Interaction Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acquisition and analysis of high-quality sensor data constitute an essential requirement in shaping the development of fully autonomous driving systems. This process is indispensable for enhancing road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of the technological advancements in the automotive industry. This study introduces the Interaction of Autonomous and Manually-Controlled Vehicles (IAMCV) dataset, a novel and extensive dataset focused on inter-vehicle interactions. The dataset, enriched with a sophisticated array of sensors such as Light Detection and Ranging, cameras, Inertial Measurement Unit/Global Positioning System, and vehicle bus data acquisition, provides a comprehensive representation of real-world driving scenarios that include roundabouts, intersections, country roads, and highways, recorded across diverse locations in Germany. Furthermore, the study shows the versatility of the IAMCV dataset through several proof-of-concept use cases. Firstly, an unsupervised trajectory clustering algorithm illustrates the dataset's capability in categorizing vehicle movements without the need for labeled training data. Secondly, we compare an online camera calibration method with the Robot Operating System-based standard, using images captured in the dataset. Finally, a preliminary test employing the YOLOv8 object-detection model is conducted, augmented by reflections on the transferability of object detection across various LIDAR resolutions. These use cases underscore the practical utility of the collected dataset, emphasizing its potential to advance research and innovation in the area of intelligent vehicles.</description>

      <title>Variation-Resilient FeFET-Based In-Memory Computing Leveraging Probabilistic Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability issues stemming from device level non-idealities of non-volatile emerging technologies like ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET), especially at scaled dimensions, cause substantial degradation in the accuracy of In-Memory crossbar-based AI systems. In this work, we present a variation-aware design technique to characterize the device level variations and to mitigate their impact on hardware accuracy employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approach. An effective conductance variation model is derived from the experimental measurements of cycle-to-cycle (C2C) and device-to-device (D2D) variations performed on FeFET devices fabricated using 28 nm high-$k$ metal gate technology. The variations were found to be a function of different conductance states within the given programming range, which sharply contrasts earlier efforts where a fixed variation dispersion was considered for all conductance values. Such variation characteristics formulated for three different device sizes at different read voltages were provided as prior variation information to the BNN to yield a more exact and reliable inference. Near-ideal accuracy for shallow networks (MLP5 and LeNet models) on the MNIST dataset and limited accuracy decline by $\sim$3.8-16.1% for deeper AlexNet models on CIFAR10 dataset under a wide range of variations corresponding to different device sizes and read voltages, demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed device-algorithm co-design technique.</description>
