      <title>Optimized cerebral blood flow measurement in speckle contrast optical spectroscopy via refinement of noise calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) offers a non-invasive and cost-effective method for monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, extracting accurate CBF from SCOS necessitates precise noise pre-calibration. Errors from this can degrade CBF measurement fidelity, particularly when the overall signal level is low. Such errors primarily stem from residual speckle contrast associated with camera and shot noise, whose fluctuations exhibit a temporal structure that mimics cerebral blood volume (CBV) waveforms. We propose an optimization-based framework that performs an adaptive refinement of noise calibration, mitigating the CBV-mimicking artifacts by reducing the CBF-CBV waveform correlation. Validated on 10 human subjects, our approach effectively lowered the signal threshold for reliable CBF signal from 97 to 26 electrons per pixel for a 1920x1200 pixels SCOS system. This improvement enables more accurate and robust CBF measurements in SCOS, especially at large source-detector (SD) distances for deeper tissue interrogation.</description>

      <title>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part I: Noise-Aware Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Near-Field MIMO Channel Capacity and Mid-Band Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array size and carrier frequency, near-field MIMO communications will become crucial in 6G wireless networks. Due to the increase of MIMO near-field range, the research of near-field MIMO capacity has aroused wide interest. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical analysis and empirical study of near-field MIMO capacity. First, the near-field channel model is characterized from the electromagnetic information perspective. Second, with the uniform planar array (UPA), the channel capacity based on effective degree of freedom (EDoF) is analyzed theoretically, and the closed-form analytical expressions are derived in detail. Finally, based on the numerical verification of near-field channel measurement experiment at 13 GHz band, we reveal that the channel capacity of UPA-type MIMO systems decreases continuously with the communication distance increasing. It can be observed that the near-field channel capacity gain is relatively obvious when large-scale MIMO is adopted at both receiving and transmitter ends, but the near-field channel capacity gain may be limited in the actual communication system with the small antenna array at receiving end. This work will give some reference to the near-field communication systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Both Pilots and Data Payloads for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is one of the key enabling technologies in future sixth-generation (6G) networks. Current ISAC systems predominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to accomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a small portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance the system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random data payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC performance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random data symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix theory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC precoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a specifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To provide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals that, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals, the sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically determined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length. Based on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is transformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions of ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly, by leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is reduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Optimization Framework for ISAC: From Electromagnetic Shaping to Network Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key feature for sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing an opportunity to meet the dual demands of communication and sensing. Existing ISAC research primarily focuses on baseband optimization at individual access points, with limited attention to the roles of electromagnetic (EM) shaping and network-wide coordination. The intricate interdependencies between these domains remain insufficiently explored, leaving their full potential for enhancing ISAC performance largely untapped. To bridge this gap, we consider multi-domain ISAC optimization integrating EM shaping, baseband processing, and network cooperation strategies that facilitate efficient resource management and system-level design. We analyze the fundamental trade-offs between these domains and offer insights into domain-specific and cross-domain strategies contributing to ISAC performance and efficiency. We then conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of joint multi-domain optimization. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions to connect theoretical advancements and practical ISAC deployments. This work paves the way for intelligent and scalable ISAC architectures, providing critical insights for their seamless integration into next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-Driven RANs for 6G and Beyond: Architectural Advancements and Future Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is envisioned that 6G networks will be supported by key architectural principles, including intelligence, decentralization, interoperability, and digitalization. With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), embedding intelligence into the foundation of wireless communication systems is recognized as essential for 6G and beyond. Existing radio access network (RAN) architectures struggle to meet the ever growing demands for flexibility, automation, and adaptability required to build self-evolving and autonomous wireless networks. In this context, this paper explores the transition towards AI-driven RAN (AI-RAN) by developing a novel AI-RAN framework whose performance is evaluated through a practical scenario focused on intelligent orchestration and resource optimization. Besides, the paper reviews the evolution of RAN architectures and sheds light on key enablers of AI-RAN including digital twins (DTs), intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), large generative AI (GenAI) models, and blockchain (BC). Furthermore, it discusses the deployment challenges of AI-RAN, including technical and regulatory perspectives, and outlines future research directions incorporating technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and agentic AI.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Multicast Design for Pinching-Antenna Systems: Waveguide-Division or Waveguide-Multiplexing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the design of multigroup multicast communications in the pinching-antenna system (PASS). A PASS-enabled multigroup transmission framework is proposed to maximize multicast rates under a couple of transmission architectures: waveguide-division (WD) and waveguide-multiplexing (WM). 1) For WD, an element-wise sequential optimization strategy is proposed for pinching beamforming, i.e., optimizing the activated positions of pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides. Meanwhile, a log-sum-exp projected gradient descent algorithm is proposed for transmit power allocation across waveguides. 2) For WM, a majorization-minimization (MM)-based framework is proposed to tackle the problem's non-smoothness and non-convexity. On this basis, a low-complexity element-wise sequential optimization method is developed for pinching beamforming using the MM surrogate objective. Furthermore, the optimal transmit beamformer structure is derived from the MM surrogate objective using the Lagrange duality, with an efficient transmit beamforming algorithm proposed using projected adaptive gradient descent. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) both WD and WM architectures in PASS achieve significant multicast rate improvements over conventional MIMO techniques, especially for systems with large service areas; ii) WM is more robust than WD in dense deployments, while WD excels when user groups are spatially separated.</description>

      <title>DCFNet: Doppler Correction Filter Network for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a headline feature for the forthcoming IMT-2030 and 6G releases, yet a concrete solution that fits within the established orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) family remains open. Specifically, Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI) destroys sub-carrier orthogonality of OFDM sensing signals, blurring range-velocity maps and severely degrading sensing accuracy. Building on multi-user multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) OFDM systems, this paper proposes Doppler-Correction Filter Network (DCFNet), an AI-native ISAC model that delivers fine range-velocity resolution at minimal complexity without altering the legacy frame structure. A bank of DCFs first shifts dominant ICI energy away from critical Doppler bins; a compact deep learning network then suppresses the ICI. To further enhance the range and velocity resolutions, we propose DCFNet with local refinement (DCFNet-LR), which applies a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to refine target estimates of DCFNet to sub-cell accuracy. Simulation results show that DCFNet-LR runs $143\times$ faster than maximum likelihood search and achieves significantly superior performance, reducing the range RMSE by up to $2.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times and the velocity RMSE by $6.7 \times 10^{-4}$ times compared to conventional detection methods.</description>

      <title>MASC: Integrated Sensing and Communications for the Martian Internet of Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars exploration missions increasingly demand reliable communication systems, yet harsh environmental conditions -- particularly frequent dust storms, extreme Doppler effects, and stringent resource constraints -- pose unprecedented challenges to conventional communication approaches. This paper presents the Martian Adaptive Sensing and Communication (MASC) system specifically designed for the Martian environment. MASC establishes a physically interpretable channel model and develops three key components: environment-aware hybrid precoding, adaptive parameter mapping, and robust communication precoding. Simulation results demonstrate that MASC maintains 45 percent sensing coverage under severe dust conditions compared to only 5 percent with conventional methods, provides up to 2.5 dB signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement at 50 percent channel state information (CSI) uncertainty, and yields 80 percent higher capacity in moderate dust storms. Using an epsilon-constraint multi-objective optimization approach, we enable mission planners to select operational modes ranging from communication-priority (0.33 bps/Hz capacity, 28 percent sensing coverage) to sensing-priority (90 percent coverage with minimal capacity), offering a versatile framework that balances environmental awareness with hyper-reliable data transmission. This work provides a validated blueprint for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN), a key enabler for achieving ubiquitous connectivity in the 6G era.</description>

      <title>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part II: Pyramid Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of wireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby collapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly reducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a noise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min optimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed constellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function outputs.
  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and quantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for large-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling strategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points to reduce the encoder design complexity from $\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to $\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\in\{1,\dots, K\}$ denotes the sampling order, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the network. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a controlled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation accuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which confines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding destructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations (e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via several simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels, and noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance with orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.</description>

      <title>Refining Ray-Tracing Accuracy and Efficiency in the Context of FRMCS Urban Railway Channel Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming roll-out of the new wireless communication standard for wireless railway services, FRMCS, requires a thorough understanding of the system performance in real-world conditions, since this will strongly influence the deployment costs and the effectiveness of an infrastructure planned for decades. The virtual testing of the equipment and network performance in realistic simulated scenarios is key; its accuracy depends on the reliability of the predicted radio channel properties. In this article, the authors explain how they are evolving a ray-tracing (RT) tool to apply it to the specific case of simulating the radio link between the FRMCS fixed infrastructure and an antenna placed on the roof of a train moving in an urban environment. First, a dynamic version of the RT tool is used to capture the rapid variations of all channel metrics; a compromise is sought between computation time and accuracy. Besides, a hybridization of RT and physical optics (PO) allows the integration of objects near the track, such as catenary pylons, into the simulation. A case study shows that the scattering by metallic pylons brings a significant contribution.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach to Massive Communication and Ubiquitous Connectivity in 6G Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full-scale 6G standardization has attracted considerable recent attention, especially since the first 3GPP-wide 6G workshop held in March 2025. To understand the practical and fundamental values of 6G and facilitate its standardization, it is crucial to explore the theoretical limits of spectrum, energy, and coverage efficiency considering practical hardware and signaling constraints. In this paper, we present a mean-field-approximation-based investigation on two out of six use case scenarios defined by IMT-2030, namely, massive communication and ubiquitous connectivity. Being aware of the limitation in interference cancellation owing to constrained cost and hardware complexity, we investigate the spectrum reuse architecture in both usage scenarios. We propose a tractable spectrum reuse with low signaling overhead consumed for channel estimation and channel state information (CSI) feedback. Our analysis indicates that the massive communication over cellular and device-to-device (D2D) networks can benefit from channel orthogonalization, while it is unnecessary to share the CSI of interfering links. Moreover, deploying relays or movable base stations, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicle, yields substantial energy and spectrum gain for ubiquitous connectivity, despite introducing interference. As such, the mean-field-optimization-based evaluation is expected to positively impact 6G and NextG standardization in 3GPP and other standardization bodies.</description>

      <title>Beamforming design for minimizing the signal power estimation error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of beamformers in their ability to either maintain or estimate the true signal power of the signal of interest (SOI). Our focus is particularly on the Capon beamformer and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) beamformer. The Capon beamformer, also known as the minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) or the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, is a widely used method in array signal processing. A curious feature of both the Capon and the MMSE beamformers is their tendency to either overestimate or underestimate the signal power. That is, they are not asymptotically unbiased (as the sample size approaches infinity). To address this issue, we propose to shrink the Capon beamformer by finding a scaling factor that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal power estimate. The new beamformer, referred to as the Capon$^+$ beamformer, is evaluated against the Capon and MMSE beamformers in terms of bias, signal power MSE, and signal waveform MSE. The Capon$^+$ beamformer strikes a better balance between signal power and waveform estimation while also exhibiting minimal bias, which approaches zero as the sample size increases.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Sensing Tool Release: Gathering 802.11ax Channel State Information from a Commercial Wi-Fi Access Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a powerful technology, leveraging channel state information (CSI) extracted from wireless data packets to enable diverse applications, ranging from human presence detection to gesture recognition and health monitoring. However, CSI extraction from commercial Wi-Fi access point lacks and out of date. This paper introduces ZTECSITool,a toolkit designed to capture high-resolution CSI measurements from commercial Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) access points, supporting bandwidths up to 160 MHz and 512 subcarriers. ZTECSITool bridges a critical gap in Wi-Fi sensing research, facilitating the development of next-generation sensing systems.

      <title>Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Affine Filter Bank Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-complexity receiver structure for the recently introduced Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM) scheme, which is a novel waveform designed for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems operating in doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The proposed receiver structure is based on the Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) framework, making use of only element-wise scalar operations to perform detection of the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that AFBM in conjunction with GaBP outperforms affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in terms of bit error rates (BERs) in DD channels, while achieving very low out-of-band emissions (OOBE) in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Hidden Markov Anomaly over Multiple Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting an anomalous process among a large number of processes. At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state) or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d. observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>On Energy-Efficient Passive Beamforming Design of RIS-Assisted CoMP-NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the synergistic potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance the energy efficiency and performance of next-generation wireless networks. We delve into the design of energy-efficient passive beamforming (PBF) strategies within RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)-NOMA networks. Two distinct RIS configurations, namely, enhancement-only PBF (EO) and enhancement &amp; cancellation PBF (EC), are proposed and analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks offer significant efficiency gains compared to traditional CoMP-NOMA systems. Furthermore, we formulate a PBF design problem to optimize the RIS phase shifts for maximizing energy efficiency. Our results reveal that the optimal PBF design is contingent upon several factors, including the number of cooperating base stations (BSs), the number of RIS elements deployed, and the RIS configuration. This study underscores the potential of RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks as a promising solution for achieving superior energy efficiency and overall performance in future wireless networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a cost-effective technology for terahertz (THz) communications by enabling programmable control of the wireless environment. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of IRSs-aided THz communications, covering hardware designs, advanced signal processing techniques, and practical deployment strategies. It first examines key THz reconfigurable metasurface architectures, including electronic, optical, phase-change material, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based implementations, highlighting their reconfiguration mechanisms and challenges. Then, fundamental effects including near field and beam squint in wideband THz systems are analyzed, along with their impacts on system performance. The paper further explores conventional and beam-squint-assisted channel estimation methods, innovative beam management strategies, and deployment considerations across large- and small-scale scenarios. Practical experiments at 220 gigahertz (GHz) validate the effectiveness of IRS in improving signal strength and communication reliability for both single-user and multi-user setups.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Multi-sensor Adaptive Birth Samplers for Labeled Random Finite Set Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive track initiation remains a crucial component of many modern multi-target tracking systems. For labeled random finite sets multi-object filters, prior work has been established to construct a labeled multi-object birth density using measurements from multiple sensors. A naive construction of this adaptive birth set density results in an exponential number of newborn components in the number of sensors. A truncation procedure was provided that leverages a Gibbs sampler to truncate the birth density, reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of sensors. However, only a limited discussion has been provided on additional algorithmic techniques that can be employed to substantially reduce the complexity in practical tracking applications. In this paper, we propose five efficiency enhancements for the labeled random finite sets multi-sensor adaptive birth procedure. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate their computational benefits and show that they result in a negligible change to the multi-target tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near-Far Field 6D Movable Antenna Design Exploiting Directional Sparsity and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been identified as a new disruptive technology for future wireless systems to support a large number of users with only a few antennas. However, the intricate relationships between the signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to inaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies between the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in practical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the near-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the high-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the estimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and rotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely high computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently constructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In addition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions, rotations, and beamforming in a unified manner. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid-field channel model and channel estimation algorithm outperform existing approaches and that the DRL-enhanced 6DMA system significantly surpasses flexible antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Reasoning via Latent Steering Vectors Improves Inference Time Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.</description>

      <title>HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) are emerging as a promising paradigm to support various low-altitude services through integrated air-ground infrastructure. To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Portable Lidar-based Mobile Mapping System on an Android Smartphone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of the metaverse, digital twins, and robotics underscores the demand for low-cost, portable mapping systems for reality capture. Current mobile solutions, such as the Leica BLK2Go and lidar-equipped smartphones, either come at a high cost or are limited in range and accuracy. Leveraging the proliferation and technological evolution of mobile devices alongside recent advancements in lidar technology, we introduce a novel, low-cost, portable mobile mapping system. Our system integrates a lidar unit, an Android smartphone, and an RTK-GNSS stick. Running on the Android platform, it features lidar-inertial odometry built with the NDK, and logs data from the lidar, wide-angle camera, IMU, and GNSS. With a total bill of materials (BOM) cost under 2,000 USD and a weight of about 1 kilogram, the system achieves a good balance between affordability and portability. We detail the system design, multisensor calibration, synchronization, and evaluate its performance for tracking and mapping. To further contribute to the community, the system's design and software are made open source at: https://github.com/OSUPCVLab/marslogger_android/releases/tag/v2.1</description>

      <title>A Scalable Factorization Approach for High-Order Structured Tensor Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping through Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic constellation shaping enables easy rate adaption and has been proven to reduce the gap to Shannon capacity. Constellation point probabilities are optimized to maximize either the mutual information or the bit-wise mutual information. The optimization problem is however challenging even for simple channel models. While autoencoder-based machine learning has been applied successfully to solve this problem [1], it requires manual computation of additional terms for the gradient which is an error-prone task. In this work, we present novel loss functions for autoencoder-based learning of probabilistic constellation shaping for coded modulation systems using automatic differentiation and importance sampling. We show analytically that our proposed approach also uses exact gradients of the constellation point probabilities for the optimization. In simulations, our results closely match the results from [1] for the additive white Gaussian noise channel and a simplified model of the intensity-modulation direct-detection channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations -- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74% accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning for Personalized and Label-Free Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail. Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate individual recordings in mixed populations with &gt;= 90% accuracy and distinguish different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96% and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond cardiology.</description>

      <title>SparseDPD: A Sparse Neural Network-based Digital Predistortion FPGA Accelerator for RF Power Amplifier Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital predistortion (DPD) is crucial for linearizing radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs), improving signal integrity and efficiency in wireless systems. Neural network (NN)-based DPD methods surpass traditional polynomial models but face computational challenges limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces SparseDPD, an FPGA accelerator employing a spatially sparse phase-normalized time-delay neural network (PNTDNN), optimized through unstructured pruning to reduce computational load without accuracy loss.

      <title>IsoNet: Causal Analysis of Multimodal Transformers for Neuromuscular Gesture Classification</title>

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2 (sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force). Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7% on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways, quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers, highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.</description>

      <title>Codeword-Segmentation Rate-Splitting Multiple Access and Evaluation under Suboptimal Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique. We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA, namely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA which splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding, CS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into common and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and private streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance analysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in mismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can better capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under finite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed. The numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than conventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a physical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through link-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that CS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control signaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA.</description>

Abstract: Research on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks is emerging. However, breakthroughs in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occur in natural language processing. There is a lack of a clear technical direction on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems, which typically have many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper reviews recent research on BAIM for wireless systems and assesses the current state of the field. It then analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing wireless native BAIM technologies, as well as specific issues that need to be considered for technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless systems, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for developing wireless native BAIM.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A First Experimental Study</title>

Abstract: A canonical use case of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involves a multi-antenna transmitter communicating with $K$ users and sensing targets in its vicinity. For this setup, precoder and multiple access designs are of utmost importance, as the limited transmit power budget must be efficiently directed towards the desired directions (users and targets) to maximize both communications and sensing performance. This problem has been widely investigated analytically under various design choices, in particular (a) whether or not a dedicated sensing signal is needed, and (b) for different MIMO multiple access techniques, such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). However, a conclusive answer on which design choice achieves the best ISAC performance, backed by experimental results, remains elusive. We address this vacuum by experimentally evaluating and comparing RSMA and SDMA for communicating with two users $(K = 2)$ and sensing (ranging) one target. Over three scenarios that are representative of \emph{vehicular} ISAC, covering different levels of inter-user interference and separation/integration between sensing and communications, we show that RSMA without a dedicated sensing signal achieves better ISAC performance -- i.e., higher sum throughput (up to $50\%$ peak throughput gain) for similar radar SNR (between $20$ to $24{\rm dB}$) -- than SDMA with a dedicated sensing signal. This first-ever experimental study of RSMA ISAC demonstrates the feasibility and the superiority of RSMA for future multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</description>

      <title>MORIC: CSI Delay-Doppler Decomposition for Robust Wi-Fi-based Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7 GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition, particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy, enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Widely Linear Augmented Extreme Learning Machine Based Impairments Compensation for Satellite Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G-V2X HetNets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a semantic-aware resource allocation (SARA) framework with flexible duty cycle (DC) coexistence mechanism (SARADC) for 5G-V2X Heterogeneous Network (HetNets) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proximal policy optimization (PPO). Specifically, we investigate V2X networks within a two-tiered HetNets structure. In response to the needs of high-speed vehicular networking in urban environments, we design a semantic communication system and introduce two resource allocation metrics: high-speed semantic transmission rate (HSR) and semantic spectrum efficiency (HSSE). Our main goal is to maximize HSSE. Additionally, we address the coexistence of vehicular users and WiFi users in 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) networks. To tackle this complex challenge, we propose a novel approach that jointly optimizes flexible DC coexistence mechanism and the allocation of resources and base stations (BSs). Unlike traditional bit transmission methods, our approach integrates the semantic communication paradigm into the communication system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms traditional bit transmission methods with traditional DC coexistence mechanism in terms of HSSE and semantic throughput (ST) for both vehicular and WiFi users.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model. Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Age of Information and Energy Consumption in NR-V2X System based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio (NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X (C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2, resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI). Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI. Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Online Neural Model Fine-Tuning in Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Taming The Communication Cost of Model Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is essential in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the significant feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when the data distribution shifts, primarily due to limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an online model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. We consider full-model fine-tuning, where both the encoder and decoder are jointly updated using recent CSI samples. A key challenge in this setup is the transmission of updated decoder parameters, which introduces additional feedback overhead. To mitigate this bottleneck, we incorporate the bit-rate of model updates into the fine-tuning objective and entropy code the updates jointly with the compressed CSI. To reduce the bit-rate, we design an efficient prior distribution that encourages the network to update only the most significant weights, thereby minimizing the overall model update cost. Our results show that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression despite the additional communication cost of model updates. Moreover, we investigate the impact of update frequency in dynamic wireless environments and identify an optimal fine-tuning interval that achieves the best RD trade-off.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi-talker distant automatic speech recognition (DASR) system we designed for the DASR task 1 of the CHiME-8 challenge. Our system performs speaker counting, diarization, and ASR. It handles various recording conditions, from diner parties to professional meetings and from two to eight speakers. We perform diarization first, followed by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we obtained afterward. Our strongest system achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER improvement over the baseline and outperforms the challenge best results on the NOTSOFAR-1 meeting evaluation data among geometry-independent systems.</description>

      <title>Noise Resilient Over-The-Air Federated Learning In Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications demand the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving model training across distributed devices. Over-The-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) exploits the superposition property of multiple access channels, allowing edge users in 6G networks to efficiently share spectral resources and perform low-latency global model aggregation. However, these advantages come with challenges, as traditional OTA-FL techniques suffer due to the joint effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the server, fading, and both data and system heterogeneity at the participating edge devices. In this work, we propose the novel Noise Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework to jointly tackle these challenges in federated wireless networks. In NoROTA-FL, the local optimization problems find controlled inexact solutions, which manifests as an additional proximal constraint at the clients. This approach provides robustness against straggler-induced partial work, heterogeneity, noise, and fading. From a theoretical perspective, we leverage the zeroth- and first-order inexactness and establish convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in the presence of heterogeneous data and varying system capabilities. Experimentally, we validate NoROTA-FL on real-world datasets, including FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and heterogeneous environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as COTAF and FedProx, NoROTA-FL achieves significantly more stable convergence and higher accuracy, particularly in the presence of stragglers.</description>

      <title>AGI-Driven Generative Semantic Communications: Principles and Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14947</link>

Abstract: Semantic communications leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to extract semantic information for efficient data delivery, thereby significantly reducing communication cost. With the evolution towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), the increasing demands for AGI services pose new challenges to semantic communications. In this context, an AGI application is typically defined on a general-sense task, covering a broad, even unforeseen, set of objectives, as well as driven by the need for a human-friendly interface in forms (e.g., videos, images, or text) easily understood by human users.In response, we introduce an AGI-driven communication paradigm for supporting AGI applications, called generative semantic communication (GSC). We first describe the basic concept of GSC and its difference from existing semantic communications, and then introduce a general framework of GSC based on advanced AI technologies including foundation models and generative models. Two case studies are presented to verify the advantages of GSC. Finally, open challenges and new research directions are discussed to stimulate this line of research and pave the way for practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with 2 to 5 components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Design of a Wearable Parallel Electrical Impedance Imaging System for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wireless wearable Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system has been developed utilizing the AD5933 chip to achieve real-time imaging of lung respiration. The system employs a voltage excitation method tailored to human impedance characteristics, injecting current by applying a known voltage and measuring the resulting current through the body. Additionally, specific measures have been implemented to effectively suppress signal oscillations and leakage currents caused by parasitic capacitances. To enhance data acquisition speed, the system employs five parallel AD5933 units, with multiple techniques implemented to ensure high synchronization during simultaneous measurements. Performance testing shows that the system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 50 dB, a relative standard deviation below 0.3%, and a reciprocity error under 0.8%. Imaging experiments using a water tank phantom, human lungs during breathing, and a resting human calf further demonstrate that this portable EIT system can accurately measure biological tissues with high precision and low cost.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Receivers for Multi-Band Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (CommunSense). Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking a tractable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing challenges in its practical CommunSense applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals that a multi-band RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band CommunSense performance. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</description>
