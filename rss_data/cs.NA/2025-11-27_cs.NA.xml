      <title>A Modified BGK Collision Operator for Exact Conservation in Numerical Solutions of Boltzmann-BGK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines.</description>

      <title>Inverse Electromagnetic Scattering for Doubly-Connected Cylinders using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem for a magneto-dielectric cylinder covering an impedance cylinder of arbitrary shape. We solve it by introducing a divide-and-conquer framework using specially designed 1D multi-channel, circular-padding Convolutional Neural Networks. The solution of the direct problem provides us with the real and imaginary components of the far-field measurements representing the input data. We first classify the shape of the impedance cylinder and then reconstruct the unknown boundary curve and the impedance function. Through extensive numerical experiments, including noisy scenarios, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Dual-Domain Deep Learning Method to Accelerate Local Basis Functions Computation for Reservoir Simulation in High-Contrast Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In energy science, Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media is a central problem in reservoir sim-ulation. However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.</description>

      <title>Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model order reduction for wave propagation in materials with nonlinearities or damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider wave propagation in materials characterized by nonlinear properties or damage. To accelerate the simulations of the resulting high-dimensional problems, we apply model order reduction methods. Depending on the knowledge of the underlying equations and the availability of their discrete operators, intrusive methods (here projection-based approaches based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)) or non-instrusive methods (here data-driven approaches including dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and operator inference (OpInf)) can be used. We recall the theoretical foundations of the methods and apply them to the problem of wave propagation. In three different numerical examples, we evaluate the performance of the reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Truncated kernel windowed Fourier projection: a fast algorithm for the 3D free-space wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectrally accurate fast algorithm for evaluating the solution to the scalar wave equation in free space driven by a large collection of point sources in a bounded domain. With $M$ sources temporally discretized by $N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive potential evaluation at $M$ targets on the same time grid requires $\mathcal O(M^2 N_t)$ work. Our scheme requires $\mathcal{O}\left((M + N^3\log N)N_t\right)$ work, where $N$ scales as $\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, i.e., the maximum signal frequency. This is achieved by using the recently-proposed windowed Fourier projection (WFP) method to split the potential into a local part, evaluated directly, plus a smooth history part approximated by an $N^3$-point equispaced discretization of the Fourier transform, where each Fourier coefficient obeys a simple recursion relation. The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself. Thus, the method avoids the need for absorbing boundary conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with up to a million sources and targets at 6-digit accuracy. We believe it can serve as a key component in addressing time-domain wave equation scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Expectation: Concentration Inequalities for Randomized Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic iterative methods are useful in a variety of large-scale numerical linear algebraic, machine learning, and statistical problems, in part due to their low-memory footprint. They are frequently used in a variety of applications, and thus it is imperative to have a thorough theoretical understanding of their behavior. Most theoretical convergence results for stochastic iterative methods provide bounds on the expected error of the iterates, and yield a type of average case analysis. However, understanding the behavior of these methods in the near-worst-case is desirable. For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error.
  Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities.</description>

      <title>Alleviating missing boundary conditions in elliptic partial differential equations using interior point measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal recovery problem for the Poisson problem when the boundary data is unknown. Compensating information is provided in the form of a finite number of measurements of the solution. A finite element algorithm for this problem was given in Binev et al. (2024), where measurements were assumed to be either bounded linear functionals of the solution or point measurements at locations lying anywhere in the closure of the computational domain. In contrast, we focus on the case of point measurements at locations lying in the interior of the domain. This lowers the regularity requirements placed on the solution. Also, a key ingredient in the recovery process is the finite element approximation of Riesz representers associated with the measurements. Our main result is a pointwise error estimate for the Riesz representers. We apply this to obtain improved estimates which measure the performance of the recovery algorithm in various norms.</description>

      <title>Sharp Ascent--Descent Spectral Stability under Strong Resolvent Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp stability results for of non--selfadjoint the ascent and descent spectra under strong resolvent convergence (SRS), a natural framework for finite element approximations of non-selfadjoint and singularly perturbed operators. The key quantitative hypothesis is the reduced minimum modulus $\gamma(T-\lambda)&gt;0$, which guarantees closed range and enables the transfer of the Kaashoek -- Taylor criteria via gap convergence of operator graphs. At the essential level, B--Fredholm theory extends stability to powers $(T-\lambda)^m$ provided $\gamma((T-\lambda)^j)&gt;0$ for all $1\le j\le m$. We introduce a computable finite-element diagnostic $\gamma_h = \sigma_{\min}(M^{-1/2}(A_h-\lambda M)M^{-1/2})$, which serves as a practical surrogate for $\gamma(T-\lambda)$ and remains uniformly positive even in convection-dominated regimes when stabilized schemes (e.g., SUPG) are employed. Numerical experiments confirm that $\liminf_{h\to0}\gamma_h&gt;0$ is both necessary and sufficient for spectral stability, while a Volterra-type counterexample demonstrates the indispensability of the closed-range condition for powers. The analysis clarifies why norm resolvent convergence fails for rough or singular limits, and how SRS-combined with quantitative control of $\gamma_h$--rescues ascent--descent stability in realistic computational settings.</description>

      <title>A new analytical technique of the fully implicit Crank-Nicolson discontinuous Galerkin method for the Ginzburg-Landau Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a fully implicit Crank-Nicolson discontinuous Galerkin method is proposed for solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation. By leveraging a novel analytical technique, we rigorously establish the unique solvability of the constructed numerical scheme, as well as its unconditionally optimal error estimates under both the \(L^2\)-norm and the energy norm. The core of the proof hinges on the \(L^2\)-norm boundedness of the numerical solution and the refined estimation of the cubic nonlinear term. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal preconditioning techniques for finite volume approximation of three-dimensional conservative space-fractional diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Crank-Nicolson finite volume approximation for three-dimensional conservative space-fractional diffusion equation results in large and dense three-level Toeplitz discrete linear systems. Preconditioned Krylov subspace methods with sine transform-based preconditioners are developed to solve these systems, including the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method for the symmetric case and the preconditioned generalized minimal residual (PGMRES) method for the non-symmetric case. Moreover, we provide detailed analysis of the convergence of these Krylov subspace methods. Specifically, for the symmetric case, we prove the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded in the open interval (1/2, 3/2), which results in a linear convergence rate of the PCG method. For the non-symmetric case, we demonstrate that the PGMRES method also achieves a linear convergence rate independent of discretization stepsizes from the residual point of view. These results imply that the iteration counts of the PCG and PGMRES methods are uniformly bounded and independent of the matrix sizes. Numerical experiments in both symmetric and non-symmetric cases in two- and three-dimensions are conducted to confirm the optimal performance of the proposed preconditioned Krylov subspace methods.</description>

      <title>A p-adaptive high-order mesh-free framework for fluid simulations in complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel p-adaptive, high-order mesh-free framework for the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid flows in complex geometries. High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability.</description>

      <title>Rodas6P and Tsit5DA - two new Rosenbrock-type methods for DAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two new Rosenbrock methods for solving index-1 differential algebraic equations are presented. Rodas6P is a sixth-order method based on the same design principles as the Rodas3P, Rodas4P, and Rodas5P methods. Tsit5DA is based on an explicit solution approach for the differential equations and a linear-implicit approach for the algebraic equations. Such a fourth-order method has already been presented in Rentrop, Roche &amp; Steinebach, 1989. Tsit5DA now provides a significantly improved fifth-order method which is based on the well known Tsit5 method. The theoretical properties of the new methods are verified by some order tests and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Parallel matching-based AMG preconditioners for elliptic equations discretized by IgA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isogeometric analysis (IgA) offers enhanced approximation capabilities for the discretization of elliptic boundary-value problems, yet it results in large, sparse, and increasingly ill-conditioned linear systems due to higher interconnectivity among degrees of freedom. In particular, the discretization with tensor-product B-splines or NURBS of degree $p$ on a mesh with $n$ elements per parametric direction leads to symmetric positive-definite systems of the form $K\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{F}$, where the matrix bandwidth and condition number scale unfavorably with both $p$ and spatial dimension $d$. To address the computational challenges posed by such systems, especially in three-dimensional or high-order scenarios, Krylov subspace methods with specialized preconditioners become essential. This paper investigates the efficacy of algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners tailored for IgA-based discretizations, with a focus on performance in modern high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Leveraging the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), we explore distributed-memory and GPU-accelerated strategies for solving large-scale problems. The study assesses algorithmic efficiency and scalability across a range of benchmark tests. The results demonstrate that AMG preconditioners can achieve robust and scalable performance, confirming their potential as practical solvers for large IgA systems in engineering and scientific applications.</description>

      <title>The Zipped Finite Element Method: High-order Shape Functions for Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new polygonal finite element method, called the Zipped Finite Element Method, for star-shaped polygons. The proposed approach constructs high-order shape functions as linear combinations of standard finite element basis functions defined on a local trivial sub-triangulation of each element. This refinement is used solely for the construction of the shape functions and does not affect the final number of degrees of freedom. The resulting finite element space includes polynomials of the desired order and preserves conformity across elements. Consequently, the method inherits the convergence properties of the finite element framework under suitable mesh assumptions. Numerical experiments confirm the expected rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Lopsided HSS Iterative Method and Preconditioner for a class of Complex Symmetric Linear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the lopsided HSS (LHSS) iteration method for solving a class of complex symmetric indefinite systems of linear equations. This method employs an alternating iterative scheme, where each iteration entails solving two systems of equations with symmetric real coefficient matrices. This design is intended to reduce the high computational costs associated with complex arithmetic. Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters. When the eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions, the method guarantees convergence for any positive iteration parameter. Building on this insight, we developed the preconditioned lopsided HSS iteration method (PLHSS). Theoretical results demonstrate that PLHSS exhibits superior convergence properties compared to the original method. Additionally, we derived the optimal parameters for the new approaches and corresponding optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we derive the PLHSS preconditioner on the basis of the iterative method. The eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are well-clustered, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with a specific inner product. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioned GMRES and COCG methods. LHSS iteration methods and the relevant preconditioners show mesh size independent and parameter-insensitive convergence behavior for the test numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Vertex-based Graph Neural Solver and its Application to Linear Elasticity Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of linear elasticity equations on unstructured grids presents significant difficulties, especially in the presence of heterogeneous and anisotropic materials. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel vertex-based graph Fourier neural solver. This framework seamlessly integrates a block-Jacobi smoothing stage, known for rapidly attenuating certain high-frequency errors, with a learnable Fourier-domain module designed to correct errors across the remained frequency spectrum. Extensive numerical experiments on 2D and 3D problems verify that our proposed solver exhibits superior robustness and efficiency, significantly surpassing the classical smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid method. Moreover, frequency domain analysis empirically confirms the essential complementarity between the smoother and the neural corrector.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Solvers for Energy-Conserving Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study energy-conserving Hamiltonian Boundary Value Methods (HBVMs) for Hamiltonian systems, which arise in applications where long-term preservation of energy and symplecticity is essential. HBVMs are multi-stage schemes whose stage equations reformulate as matrix equations with a low-rank right-hand side. For linear systems, we exploit this structure directly via Krylov projection solvers. For nonlinear systems, we leverage it within simplified Newton iterations and as a preconditioner in a Newton--Krylov framework, combined with adaptive time-stepping for robust convergence. Numerical experiments on semi-discretized wave equations demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mean-square exponential stability of neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs) with Markovian switching. The analysis addresses the complexities arising from the interaction between the neutral term, time-varying delays, and structural changes governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. We establish novel and practical criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of both the underlying system and its numerical approximations via the Euler-Maruyama method. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exponential decay rate of the true solution with arbitrary accuracy, provided the step size is sufficiently small. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical example that illustrates their effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>SUPN: Shallow Universal Polynomial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Time Low-Rank Approximation of Hankel Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hankel matrices are an important class of highly-structured matrices, arising across computational mathematics, engineering, and theoretical computer science. It is well-known that positive semidefinite (PSD) Hankel matrices are always approximately low-rank. In particular, a celebrated result of Beckermann and Townsend shows that, for any PSD Hankel matrix $H \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, letting $H_k$ be the best rank-$k$ approximation of $H$, $\|H-H_k\|_F \leq \epsilon \|H\|_F$ for $k = O(\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$. As such, PSD Hankel matrices are natural targets for low-rank approximation algorithms. We give the first such algorithm that runs in \emph{sublinear time}. In particular, we show how to compute, in $\polylog(n, 1/\epsilon)$ time, a factored representation of a rank-$O(\log n \log(1/\epsilon))$ Hankel matrix $\widehat{H}$ matching the error guarantee of Beckermann and Townsend up to constant factors. We further show that our algorithm is \emph{robust} -- given input $H+E$ where $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is an arbitrary non-Hankel noise matrix, we obtain error $\|H - \widehat{H}\|_F \leq O(\|E\|_F) + \epsilon \|H\|_F$. Towards this algorithmic result, our first contribution is a \emph{structure-preserving} existence result - we show that there exists a rank-$k$ \emph{Hankel} approximation to $H$ matching the error bound of Beckermann and Townsend. Our result can be interpreted as a finite-dimensional analog of the widely applicable AAK theorem, which shows that the optimal low-rank approximation of an infinite Hankel operator is itself Hankel. Armed with our existence result, and leveraging the well-known Vandermonde structure of Hankel matrices, we achieve our sublinear time algorithm using a sampling-based approach that relies on universal ridge leverage score bounds for Vandermonde matrices.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy Score Function and Score-Based Particle Algorithm for Nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The score function for the diffusion process, also known as the gradient of the log-density, is a basic concept to characterize the probability flow with important applications in the score-based diffusion generative modelling and the simulation of It\^{o} stochastic differential equations. However, neither the probability flow nor the corresponding score function for the diffusion-jump process are known. This paper delivers mathematical derivation, numerical algorithm, and error analysis focusing on the corresponding score function in non-Gaussian systems with jumps and discontinuities represented by the nonlinear L\'{e}vy--Fokker--Planck equations. We propose the L\'{e}vy score function for such stochastic equations, which features a nonlocal double-integral term, and we develop its training algorithm by minimizing the proposed loss function from samples. Based on the equivalence of the probability flow with deterministic dynamics, we develop a self-consistent score-based transport particle algorithm to sample the interactive L\'{e}vy stochastic process at discrete time grid points. We provide error bound for the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the numerical and true probability density functions by overcoming the nonlocal challenges in the L\'{e}vy score. The full error analysis with the Monte Carlo error and the time discretization error is furthermore established. To show the usefulness and efficiency of our approach, numerical examples from applications in biology and finance are tested.</description>

Abstract: The rapid and accurate evaluation of convolutions with singular kernels plays crucial roles in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Building on the recently introduced Truncated Fourier Filtering method for smooth kernels, this work presents a fast, high-order numerical methodology that extends the approach to singular kernels and non-smooth domains. The method relies on truncated Fourier expansions of a prescribed order for the characteristic function of the integration domain, as well as expansions for the products of characteristic functions and singular functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the formalism of rational complex Bezier curves. This framework is a simple extension of the CAD paradigm, since it describes arc of curves in terms of control polygons and weights, which are extended to complex values. One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to classical curves are included.</description>

      <title>Cardiocirculatory Computational Models for the Study of Hypertension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop patient-specific cardiocirculatory models with the aim of building Digital Twins for hypertension. In particular, in our pathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models and a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC circuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D model consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left ventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this representation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to ventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation compared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D model, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify the parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration process. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic, pulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To maintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy is developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to enhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an accurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of hypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for real-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful insights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a modified Hybrid Parallel Kolmogorov--Arnold Network and Multilayer Perceptron Physics-Informed Neural Network to overcome the high-frequency and multiscale challenges inherent in Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This proposed model features a trainable weighting parameter to optimize the convex combination of outputs from the Kolmogorov--Arnold Network and the Multilayer Perceptron, thus maximizing the networks' capabilities to capture different frequency components. Furthermore, we adopt an overlapping domain decomposition technique to decompose complex problems into subproblems, which alleviates the challenge of global optimization. Benchmark results demonstrate that our method reduces training costs and improves computational efficiency compared with manual hyperparameter tuning in solving high-frequency multiscale problems.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that we can carry over the strategy of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) to Summation-by-Parts (SBP) Finite Difference (FD) methods to achieve divergence- and curl-free discretizations. This is not obvious at first sight, as for SBP-FD no basis functions are known, but only values and derivatives at points. The key is a remarkable analytic relationship that enables us to construct compatible operators using integral and nodal degrees of freedom. Pre-existing SBP-FD matrix operators can then be used to obtain nodal values from the integral degrees of freedom to derive a scheme with the desired properties.</description>

      <title>A multilevel stochastic regularized first-order method with application to finite sum minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multilevel stochastic framework for the solution of nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems. The proposed approach uses random regularized first-order models that exploit an available hierarchical description of the problem, being either in the classical variable space or in the function space, meaning that different levels of accuracy for the objective function are available. We propose a convergence analysis showing an almost sure global convergence of the method to a first order stationary point. The numerical behavior is tested on the solution of finite sum minimization problems. Differently from classical deterministic multilevel schemes, our stochastic method does not require the finest approximation to coincide with the original objective function along all the optimization process. This allows for significantly decreasing their cost, for instance in data-fitting problems, where considering all the data at each iteration can be avoided.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Flow Matching: Sampling Generative Models with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a flexible framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Meets PDEs: A Unified Framework for Physics-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Approximation rates of quantum neural networks for periodic functions via Jackson's inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.</description>

      <title>Duality Perspective on Nonlinear Eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear eigenproblems for a broad class of proper, closed, convex functionals in reflexive Banach spaces. We develop a dual formulation of the nonlinear eigenproblem using the Fenchel conjugate and establish an equivalence to the primal problem. Further, we introduce a duality gap and a geometric characterization of eigenvectors that apply in general Banach spaces. We interpret the dual problem as the eigenproblem for the inverse operator of the primal problem. Concerning numerical methods for solving nonlinear eigenproblems, we analyze the inverse power method, framed as a dual power method, showing strong convergence in the case of absolutely p-homogeneous functionals. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive numerical experiments for the p-Laplacian. We further connect the flow-based proximal power method from the literature to the inverse power method and discuss two numerical approaches to approximate higher-order nonlinear eigenfunctions.</description>
