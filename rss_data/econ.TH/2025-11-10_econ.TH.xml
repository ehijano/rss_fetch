      <title>Characterizing the ELS Values with Fixed-Population Invariance Axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study efficient, linear, and symmetric (ELS) values, a central family of allocation rules for cooperative games with transferable-utility (TU-games) that includes the Shapley value, the CIS value, and the ENSC value. We first show that every ELS value can be written as the Shapley value of a suitably transformed TU-game. We then introduce three types of invariance axioms for fixed player populations. The first type consists of composition axioms, and the second type is active-player consistency. Each of these two types yields a characterization of a subclass of the ELS values that contains the family of least-square values. Finally, the third type is nullified-game consistency: we define three such axioms, and each axiom yields a characterization of one of the Shapley, CIS, and ENSC values.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Proportional Division Value in TU-Games via Fixed-Population Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the proportional division value in TU-games, which distributes the worth of the grand coalition in proportion to each player's stand-alone worth. Focusing on fixed-population consistency, we characterize the proportional division value through three types of axioms: a homogeneity axiom, composition axioms, and a nullified-game consistency axiom. The homogeneity axiom captures scale invariance with respect to the grand coalition's worth. The composition axioms ensure that payoffs remain consistent when the game is decomposed and recomposed. The nullified-game consistency axiom requires that when some players' payoffs are fixed, the solution for the remaining players, computed in the game adjusted to account for these fixed payoffs, coincides with their original payoffs. Together with efficiency and a fairness-related axiom, these axioms characterize the proportional division value.</description>

      <title>The Coarse Nash Bargaining Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the axiomatic bargaining problem and proposes a new class of bargaining solutions, called coarse Nash solutions. These solutions assign to each problem a set of outcomes coarser than that chosen by the classical Nash solution (Nash, 1950). Our main result shows that these solutions can be characterized by new rationality axioms for choice correspondences, which are modifications of Nash's independence of irrelevant alternatives (or more precisely, Arrow's (1959) choice axiom), when combined with standard axioms.</description>

      <title>Worker Selection and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model where a manager repeatedly selects one worker from a group of homogeneous workers to perform a task. We characterize the largest set of parameters under which an equilibrium achieving efficient worker performance exists. We then show that this is the set of parameters given which the following manager's strategy constitutes an efficient equilibrium: the manager cyclically orders all workers and if the task is undesirable (resp., desirable), a worker is selected until good (resp., bad) performance, after which the manager randomizes between reselecting him and moving to the next worker; the reselection probability is set to be as high as effort incentives permit. Our findings extend to repeated selection of multiple workers.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Optimally Acquired Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for modeling the cost of information acquisition based on the principle of cost-minimization. We study the reduced-form \emph{indirect cost} of information generated by the sequential minimization of a primitive \emph{direct cost} function. Indirect cost functions: (i) are characterized by a novel recursive property, \emph{sequential learning-proofness}; (ii) provide an optimization foundation for the popular class of ``uniformly posterior separable'' costs; and (iii) can often be tractably calculated from their underlying direct costs. We apply the framework by identifying fundamental modeling tradeoffs in the rational inattention literature and two new indirect cost functions that balance these tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Robust Technology Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how uncertain technologies should be robustly regulated and how regulation should evolve with new information. An adaptive sandbox comprising a zero marginal tax up to an evolving quantity limit is (i) robust: it delivers optimal payoff guarantees when the agent's learning process and/or preferences are chosen adversarially; (ii) dominant: it outperforms other robust and regular mechanisms across all agent learning processes and preferences; (iii) time-consistent: it is the only robust mechanism that can be implemented without commitment. Robustness is important: absent robust regulation, worst-case payoffs can be arbitrarily poor and are induced by weak but growing optimism that encourages excessive risk-taking. Our results offer optimality foundations for existing policy and speak directly to current debates around managing emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatically define a cardinal social inefficiency function, which, given a set of alternatives and individuals' vNM preferences over the alternatives, assigns a unique number -- the social inefficiency -- to each alternative. These numbers -- and not only their order -- are uniquely defined by our axioms despite no exogenously given interpersonal comparison, outside option, or disagreement point. We interpret these numbers as per-capita losses in endogenously normalized utility. We apply our social inefficiency function to a setting in which interpersonal comparison is notoriously hard to justify -- object allocation without money -- leveraging techniques from computer science to prove an approximate-efficiency result for the Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sender persuades a strategically naive decisionmaker (DM) by committing privately to an experiment. Sender's choice of experiment is unknown to the DM, who must form her posterior beliefs nonparametrically by applying some learning rule to an IID sample of (state, message) realizations.
  We show that, given mild regularity conditions, the empirical payoff functions hypo-converge to the full-information counterpart. This is sufficient to ensure that payoffs and optimal signals converge to the Bayesian benchmark.
  For finite sample sizes, the force of this "sampling friction" is nonmonotonic: it can induce more informative experiments than the Bayesian benchmark in settings like the classic Prosecutor-Judge game, and less revelation even in situations with perfectly aligned preferences. For many problems with state-independent preferences, we show that there is an optimal finite sample size for the DM. Although the DM would always prefer a larger sample for a fixed experiment, this result holds because the sample size affects sender's choice of experiment.
  Our results are robust to imperfectly informative feedback and the choice of learning rule.</description>
