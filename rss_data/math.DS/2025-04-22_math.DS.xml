      <title>Unique Bernoulli Gibbs states and g-measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sufficient condition for the Gibbs states of a shift-invariant specification on a one-dimensional lattice to be the $g$-chains for some continuous function $g$ is obtained. This is then used to derive criteria under which there is a unique Gibbs state, which is also shift-invariant and Bernoulli.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the potential of HIV self-testing to reduce HIV incidence in EHE districts: a modeling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: High HIV transmission persists in many U.S. jurisdictions despite prevention efforts. HIV self-testing offers a means to overcome barriers associated with routine laboratory-based testing but carries a risk of increasing incidence if replacement effects reduce overall test sensitivity. Methods: A linearized four-compartment HIV transmission model was applied to 38 Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdictions. A threshold testing level was defined to counterbalance potential negative effects from reduced self-test sensitivity. Both the percentage of self-tests and the overall testing rate were varied to quantify 10-year changes in HIV incidence. Results: Substantial heterogeneity emerged across districts. Incidence reductions exceeded 5 percent in some areas, while others saw only minor effects. Jurisdictions with higher baseline testing displayed an elevated risk of increased incidence from substitution of laboratory-based testing with self-tests. In contrast, a derived Awareness Reproduction Number, capturing transmissions attributable to undiagnosed infection, strongly correlated with the magnitude of possible incidence declines. Conclusions: Local epidemiological context is pivotal in determining the risks and benefits of HIV self-testing. Jurisdictions with robust testing systems may face a greater likelihood of inadvertently raising incidence, whereas those with a high number of individuals stand to achieve notable transmission reductions. Tailoring self-testing strategies based on jurisdiction-specific conditions can maximize public health benefits while minimizing unintended consequences.</description>

      <title>Delayed Keen Model with Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keen's model describes the dynamics between wage share, employment rate and debt ratio. In literature, the model was extended to represent the effects of inflation and also the speculative money flow. Based on the inflationary model, we take into account a time delay in the inflation term which stands for the period before the effects of inflation are seen. We observe that, the delayed system may experience a Hopf bifurcation and exhibit cyclic behavior around an equilibrium point, although the non-delayed model is stable under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>3D Printing of Invariant Manifolds in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariant manifolds are one of the key features that organize the dynamics of a differential equation. We introduce a novel approach to visualizing and studying invariant manifolds by using 3D printing technology, combining advanced computational techniques with modern 3D printing processes to transform mathematical abstractions into tangible models. Our work addresses the challenges of translating complex manifolds into printable meshes, showcasing results for the following systems of differential equations: the Lorenz system, the Arneodo-Coullet-Tresser system, and the Langford system. By bridging abstract mathematics and physical reality, this approach promises new tools for research and education in nonlinear dynamics. We conclude with practical guidelines for reproducing and extending our results, emphasizing the potential of 3D-printed manifolds to enhance understanding and exploration in dynamical systems theory.</description>

      <title>The Global Phase Space of the Three-Vortex Interaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a symplectic reduction of the evolution equations for a system of three point vortices and use the reduced system to succinctly explain a kind of bifurcation diagram that has appeared in the literature in a form that was difficult to understand and interpret. Using this diagram, we enumerate and plot all the global phase-space diagrams that occur as the circulations of the three vortices are varied. The reduction proceeds in two steps: a reduction to Jacobi coordinates and a Lie-Poisson reduction. In a recent paper, we used a different method in the second step. This took two forms depending on a sign that arose in the calculation. The Lie-Poisson equations unify these into a single form. The Jacobi coordinate reduction fails when the total circulation vanishes. We adapt the reduction method to this case and show how it relates to the non-vanishing case.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer theory and pseudo-Anosov flows I: Generators and categorification of the zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bring to light a new connection between dynamics and Heegaard Floer homology. On a closed 3-manifold $Y$ we consider a pseudo-Anosov flow $\phi$ with no perfect fits with respect to its singularity locus $L \subset Y$, or perhaps a larger collection of closed orbits. Using work of Agol and Gu\'eritaud on veering branched surfaces we produce a chain complex computing the link Floer homology of $L$ in the framing specified by the degeneracy curves of the flow. Using work of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor we show that the generators of the chain complex correspond to certain closed multi-orbits of $\phi$. We prove that two canonical generators $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{top}$ and $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{bot}$ determine non-trivial homology classes located in the $\text{spin}^\text{c}$-grading of the flow, and its opposite. Finally, we observe that our specific model of the chain complex for link Floer homology naturally supports a grading with dynamical significance. This grading, a modification of the regular Maslov grading, is shown to categorify a suitable normalization of the zeta function associated to $\phi$.</description>

      <title>The Dirac operator for the Ruelle-Koopman pair on L^p-spaces: an interplay between Connes distance and symbolic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $\bm{\mu}$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift \(\sigma\) acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by
  $\ruelle$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $\koopman = \ruelle^{\dagger}$ the Koopman operator, both acting on
  $\lp{2}(\bm{\mu})$. Using a diagonal representation $\pi$, the Ruelle-Koopman pair can be used for defining
  a dynamical Dirac operator $\mathcal{D},$ as in \cite{BL}. $\mathcal{D}$ plays the role of a derivative. In
  \cite{lpspec}, the notion of a spectral triple was generalized to \(\lp{p}\)-operator algebras; in consonance, here, we
  generalize results for $\mathcal{D}$ to results for a Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_p$ , and the associated Connes distance $d_p$,
  to this new \(\lp{p}\) context, \(p \geq 1\). Given the states $\eta, \xi$:
  $d_{p}(\eta, \xi) \defn \sup \{ \,|\eta(a) - \xi(a) |
  where a \in \mathcal{A} and
  \norm{\left[\mathcal{D}_p,\pi(a)\right]} \leq 1\}$.
  The operator $M_f$ acts on $L^p (\mu).$ We explore the relationship of $\mathcal{D}_p$ with dynamics,
  in particular with $f \circ \sigma - f$, the discrete-time derivative of a continuous $f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. Take
  $p,p^{\prime}&gt;0$ satisfying $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{ p^{\prime}}=1$. We show for any continuous function $f$:
  $\norm{\left[ \dirac_p, \pi(\mult_f) \right]} = | \sqrt[\lambda]{\ruelle \abs{f \circ \sigma - f}^{\lambda}} |_{\infty}$,
  where $\lambda = \max\{p, p^\prime\}$.
  Furthermore, we show $\norm{\left[ \mathcal{D}_p, \pi(\koopman^{n} \mathcal{L}^{n})]\right]}=1$
  for all \(n \geq 1\). We also prove
  a formula analogous to the Kantorovich duality formula for minimizing the cost of tensor products.</description>

      <title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the algebraic conditions under which a cellular automaton with a non-linear local rule exhibits surjectivity and reversibility. We also analyze the role of permutivity as a key factor influencing these properties and provide conditions that determine whether a non-linear CA is (bi)permutive. Through theoretical results and illustrative examples, we characterize the relationships between these fundamental properties, offering new insights into the dynamical behavior of non-linear CA.</description>

      <title>Universal differential equations for optimal control problems and its application on cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper highlights a parallel between the forward backward sweeping method for optimal control and deep learning training procedures. We reformulate a classical optimal control problem, constrained by a differential equation system, into an optimization framework that uses neural networks to represent control variables. We demonstrate that this deep learning method adheres to Pontryagin Maximum Principle and mitigates numerical instabilities by employing backward propagation instead of a backward sweep for the adjoint equations. As a case study, we solve an optimal control problem to find the optimal combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our approach holds significant potential across various fields, including epidemiology, ecological modeling, engineering, and financial mathematics, where optimal control under complex dynamic constraints is crucial.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop a novel functional analytic approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in establishing the existence, uniqueness, regularity of disintegration, and statistical properties of equilibrium states associated with a class of discontinuous dynamics. We apply this approach to a group of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps and a set of potentials. Furthermore, we prove several limit theorems, such as exponential decay of correlations, and propose certain conjectures. Additionally, we provide a set of examples where these results can be applied, including discontinuous dynamics semi-conjugated to the Manneville-Pomeau map.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Games on Infinite Strategy Sets: Convergence to Nash Equilibria via Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary dynamics for population games in which players have a continuum of strategies at their disposal. Models in this setting amount to infinite-dimensional differential equations evolving on the manifold of probability measures. We generalize dissipativity theory for evolutionary games from finite to infinite strategy sets that are compact metric spaces, and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of Nash equilibria under the infinite-dimensional dynamics. The resulting analysis is applicable to a broad class of evolutionary games, and is modular in the sense that the pertinent conditions on the dynamics and the game's payoff structure can be verified independently. By specializing our theory to the class of monotone games, we recover as special cases existing stability results for the Brown-von Neumann-Nash and impartial pairwise comparison dynamics. We also extend our theory to models with dynamic payoffs, further broadening the applicability of our framework. Throughout our analyses, we identify and elaborate on new technical conditions that are key in extending dissipativity theory from finite to infinite strategy sets, such as compactness of the set of Nash equilibria and evolution of dynamic payoffs within a compact positively invariant set. We illustrate our theory using a variety of case studies, including a novel, continuous variant of the war of attrition game.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the quasi-compactness of the transfer operator associated with skew product systems that are semi-conjugate to piecewise convex maps with a countably infinite number of branches. These non-invertible skew products admit discontinuities, with the critical set confined to a countable collection of fibers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such systems possess an invariant measure whose disintegration along the fibers exhibits bounded variation, a concept introduced and developed in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We disprove the generalized Chern-Hamilton conjecture on the existence of critical compatible metrics on contact $3$-manifolds. More precisely, we show that a contact $3$-manifold $(M,\alpha)$ admits a critical compatible metric for the Chern-Hamilton energy functional if and only if it is Sasakian or its associated Reeb flow is $C^\infty$-conjugate to an algebraic Anosov flow modeled on $\widetilde{SL}(2, \mathbb R)$. In particular, this yields a complete topological classification of compact $3$-manifolds that admit critical compatible metrics. As a corollary we prove that no contact structure on $\mathbb{T}^3$ admits a critical compatible metric and that critical compatible metrics can only occur when the contact structure is tight.</description>

      <title>Role of flow topology in wind-driven wildfire propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wildfires propagate through intricate interactions between wind, fuel, and terrain, resulting in complex behaviors that pose challenges for accurate predictions. This study investigates the interaction between wind velocity topology and wildfire spread dynamics, aiming to enhance our understanding of wildfire spread patterns. We revisited the non-dimensionalizion of the governing combustion model by incorporating three distinct time scales. This approach revealed two new non-dimensional numbers, contrasting with the conventional non-dimensionalization that considers only a single time scale. Through scaling analysis, we analytically identified the critical determinants of transient wildfire behavior and established a state-neutral curve, indicating where initial wildfires extinguish for specific combinations of the identified non-dimensional numbers. Subsequently, a wildfire transport solver was developed using a finite difference method, integrating compact schemes and implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods. We explored the influence of stable and unstable manifolds in wind velocity on wildfire transport under steady wind conditions defined using a saddle-type fixed point flow, emphasizing the role of the non-dimensional numbers. Additionally, we considered the benchmark unsteady double-gyre flow and examined the effect of unsteady wind topology on wildfire propagation, and quantified the wildfire response to varying wind oscillation frequencies and amplitudes using a transfer function approach. The results were compared to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) used to characterize the correspondence of manifolds with wildfire propagation. The comprehensive approach of utilizing the manifolds computed from wind topology provides valuable insights into wildfire dynamics across diverse wind scenarios, offering a potential tool for improved predictive modeling and management strategies.</description>

Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>
