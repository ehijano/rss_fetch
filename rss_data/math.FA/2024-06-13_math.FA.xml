      <title>Minimal commutant and double commutant property for analytic Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the minimality of the commutant of an analytic Toeplitz operator $M_\varphi$, when $M_\varphi$ is defined on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ and $\varphi\in H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, denotes a bounded analytic function on $\mathbb{D}$. Specifically we show that the commutant of $M_\varphi$ is minimal if and only if the polynomials on $\varphi$ are weak-star dense in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, that is, $\varphi$ is a weak-star generator of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. We use our result to characterize when the double commutant of an analytic Toeplitz operator $M_\varphi$ is minimal, for a large class of symbols $\varphi$. Namelly, when $\varphi$ is an entire function, or more generally when $\varphi$ belongs to the Thomson-Cowen's class.</description>

      <title>Universal Differentiability Sets in Laakso Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a family of mutually singular doubling measures on Laakso space with respect to which real-valued Lipschitz functions are almost everywhere differentiable. This implies that there exists a measure zero universal differentiability set in Laakso space. Additionally, we show that each of the measures constructed supports a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Beurling and Model subspaces invariant under a universal operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the Beurling and Model subspaces of the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ invariant under the composition operator $C_{\phi_a}f=f\circ\phi_a$, where $\phi_a(z) = az + 1 - a$ for $a \in (0,1)$ is an affine self-map of the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. These operators have universal translates (in the sense of Rota) and have attracted attention recently due to their connection with the Invariant Subspace Problem (ISP) and the classical Ces\`aro operator.</description>

      <title>Hardy spaces and Riesz transforms on a Lie group of exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be the Lie group ${\Bbb{R}}^2\rtimes {\Bbb{R}}^+$ endowed with the Riemannian symmetric space structure. Take a distinguished basis $X_0,\, X_1,\,X_2$ of left-invariant vector fields of the Lie algebra of $G$, and consider the Laplacian $\Delta=-\sum_{i=0}^2X_i^2$ and the first-order Riesz transforms $\mathcal R_i=X_i\Delta^{-1/2}$, \hskip3pt $i=0,1,2$. We first show that the atomic Hardy space $H^1$ in $G$ introduced by the authors in a previous paper does not admit a characterization in terms of the Riesz transforms $\mathcal R_i$. It is also proved that two of these Riesz transforms are bounded from $H^1$ to $H^1$.</description>

      <title>Vector valued piecewise continuous almost automorphic functions and some consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, for $\mathbb{X}$ a Banach space, the notion of piecewise continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions with values in finite dimensional spaces is extended to piecewise continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions with values in $\mathbb{X}$. Several properties of this class of functions are provided, in particular it is shown that if $\mathbb{X}$ is a Banach algebra, then this class of functions constitute also a Banach algebra; furthermore, using the theory of $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions, a new characterization of compact almost automorphic functions is given. As consequences, with the help of $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic functions, it is presented a simple proof of the characterization of almost automorphic sequences by compact almost automorphic functions; the method permits us to give explicit examples of compact almost automorphic functions which are not almost periodic. Also, using the theory developed here, it is shown that almost automorphic solutions of differential equations with piecewise constant argument are in fact compact almost automorphic. Finally, it is proved that the classical solution of the $1D$ heat equation with continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic source is also continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic; furthermore, we comment applications to the existence and uniqueness of the asymptotically continuous $\mathbb{Z}$-almost automorphic mild solution to abstract integro-differential equations with nonlocal initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Substochastic operators in symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we solve a crucial problem under which conditions increasing uniform K-monotonicity is equivalent to lower locally uniform K-monotonicity. Next, we investigate properties of substochastic operators on $L^1+L^\infty$ with applications. Namely, we show that a countable infinite combination of substochastic operators is also substochastic. Using K-monotonicity properties, we prove several theorems devoted to the convergence of the sequence of substochastic operators in the norm of a symmetric space E under addition assumption on E. In our final discussion we focus on compactness of admissible operators for arbitrary Banach couples.</description>

      <title>Distribution spaces associated with elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complex distribution spaces given over a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ and associated with an elliptic differential operator $A$ with $C^{\infty}$-coefficients on $\overline{\Omega}$. If $X$ and $Y$ are quasi-Banach distribution spaces over $\Omega$, then the space $X(A,Y)$ under study consists of all distributions $u\in X$ such that $Au\in Y$ and is endowed with the graph quasi-norm. Assuming $X$ to be an arbitrary Besov space or Triebel--Lizorkin space over $\Omega$, we find sufficient conditions for $Y$ under which the interpolation between the spaces $X(A,Y)$ preserves their structure, these spaces are separable, and the set $C^{\infty}(\overline{\Omega})$ is dense in them. We then explicitly describe the spaces obtained by the real, complex, and $\pm$ interpolation between the spaces under study. We apply these spaces to general elliptic problems with rough boundary data by proving the Fredholm property for bounded operators induced by these problems and defined on certain spaces $X(A,Y)$. Specifically, we establish the maximal regularity of solutions to some elliptic problems with Gaussian white noise in boundary conditions. Quasi-Banach distribution spaces are involved in the concept of $X(A,Y)$ for the first time. Our results are new even for inner product Sobolev spaces of integer-valued order.</description>

      <title>Classes of operators related to subnormal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we attempt to lay the foundations for a theory encompassing some natural extensions of the class of subnormal operators, namely the $n$--subnormal operators and the sub-$n$--normal operators. We discuss inclusion relations among the above mentioned classes and other related classes, e.g., $n$--quasinormal and quasi-$n$--normal operators. We show that sub-$n$--normality is stronger than $n$--subnormality, and produce a concrete example of a $3$--subnormal operator which is not sub-$2$--normal. In \cite{CU1}, R.E. Curto, S.H. Lee and J. Yoon proved that if an operator $T$ is subnormal, left-invertible, and such that $T^n$ is quasinormal for some $n \le 2$, then $T$ is quasinormal. in \cite{JS}, P.Pietrzycki and J. Stochel improved this result by removing the assumption of left invertibility. In this paper we consider suitable analogs of this result for the case of operators in the above-mentioned classes. In particular, we prove that the weight sequence of an $n$--quasinormal unilateral weighted shift must be periodic with period at most $n$.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to: Elliptic Boundary Value Problems with Fractional Regularity Data: The First Order Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preliminary material of the monograph (arXiv:1607.03852) written by the first two authors contains two major imprecisions that necessitates a number of (in the end harmless) changes throughout the entire text. One is about identification of abstract and concrete Hardy spaces for perturbed Dirac operators, the other one about interpolation of quasi-Banach function spaces. Since these erroneous statements are not unlikely to spread, we provide a detailed corrigendum, including further background and corrected statements for all affected results. All other results remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>Functional approach to the normality of mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the article a technique of the usage of $f$-continuous functions (on mappings) and their families is developed. A proof of the Urysohn's Lemma for mappings is presented and a variant of the Brouwer-Tietze-Urysohn Extension Theorem for mappings is proven. Characterizations of the normality properties of mappings are given and the notion of a perfect normality of a mapping is introduced. It seems to be the most optimal in this approach.</description>

      <title>Realizations of free actions via their fixed point algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact group, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a unital C$^*$-algebra, and let $(\mathcal{A},G,\alpha)$ be a free C$^*$-dynamical system, in the sense of Ellwood, with fixed point algebra $\mathcal{B}$. We prove that $(\mathcal{A},G,\alpha)$ can be realized as the invariants of an equivariant coaction of $G$ on a corner of $\mathcal{B} \otimes \mathcal{K}(\mathfrak{H})$ for a certain Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}$ that arises from the freeness of the action. This extends a result by Wassermann for free C$^*$-dynamical systems with trivial fixed point algebras. As an application, we show that any faithful \Star-representation of $\mathcal{B}$ on a Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}_{\mathcal{B}}$ gives rise to a faithful covariant representation of $(\mathcal{A},G,\alpha)$ on some truncation of $\mathfrak{H}_{\mathcal{B}} \otimes \mathfrak{H}$.</description>

      <title>Weighted composition semigroups on spaces of continuous functions and their subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to weighted composition semigroups on spaces of continuous functions and their subspaces. We consider semigroups induced by semiflows and semicocycles on Banach spaces $\mathcal{F}(\Omega)$ of continuous functions on a Hausdorff space $\Omega$ such that the norm-topology is stronger than the compact-open topology like the Hardy spaces, the weighted Bergman spaces, the Dirichlet space, the Bloch type spaces, the space of bounded Dirichlet series and weighted spaces of continuous or holomorphic functions. It was shown by Gallardo-Guti\'errez, Siskakis and Yakubovich that there are no non-trivial norm-strongly continuous weighted composition semigroups on Banach spaces $\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{D})$ of holomorphic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ such that $H^{\infty}\subset\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{D})\subset\mathcal{B}_{1}$ where $H^{\infty}$ is the Hardy space of bounded holomorphic functions on $\mathbb{D}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{1}$ the Bloch space. However, we show that there are non-trivial weighted composition semigroups on such spaces which are strongly continuous w.r.t. the mixed topology between the norm-topology and the compact-open topology. We study such weighted composition semigroups in the general setting of Banach spaces of continuous functions and derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the spaces involved, the semiflows and semicocycles for strong continuity w.r.t. the mixed topology and as a byproduct for norm-strong continuity as well. Moreover, we give several characterisations of their generator and their space of norm-strong continuity.</description>

      <title>Chaotic weighted shifts on directed trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamical behaviour of weighted backward shift operators defined on sequence spaces over a directed tree. We provide a characterization of chaos on very general Fr\'echet sequence spaces in terms of the existence of a large supply of periodic points, or of fixed points. In the special case of the space $\ell^p$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, or the space $c_0$ over the tree, we provide a characterization directly in terms of the weights of the shift operators. It has turned out that these characterizations involve certain generalized continued fractions that are introduced in this paper. Special attention is given to weighted backward shifts with symmetric weights, in particular to Rolewicz operators. In an appendix, we complement our previous work by characterizing hypercyclic and mixing weighted backward shifts on very general Fr\'echet sequence spaces over a tree. Also, some of our results have a close link with potential theory on flows over trees; the link is provided by the notion of capacity, as we explain in an epilogue.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we characterize quasi-contraction, stable and convergent weighted conditional type (WCT) operators on $L^p(\mu)$. Indeed we provide equivalent conditions for quasi-contraction WCT operators. Also, we prove that convergence, uniformly stability, strongly stability and weakly stability of WCT operators are equivalent. Finally we provided some concrete examples to illustrate our main results.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure theory formalism, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda&gt;0$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi(Z)$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to the so-called parallel produuct of $\alpha$ and $\beta$: $(\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to (i) express the concentration of large-tailed random vectors, (ii) generalize Hanson Wright inequality, and (iii) provide useful insights on the so-called "multilevel concentration" that appears when $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables. This last result is obtained when we formulate the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $n$ real mappings.</description>
