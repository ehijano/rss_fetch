      <title>Benchmarking Basis Sets for Density Functional Theory Thermochemistry Calculations: Why unpolarised basis sets and the polarised 6-311G family should be avoided</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basis sets are a crucial but often largely overlooked choice when setting up quantum chemistry calculations. The choice of basis set can be critical in determining the accuracy and calculation time of your quantum chemistry calculations. Clear recommendations based on thorough benchmarking are essential, but not readily available currently. This study investigates the relative quality of basis sets for general properties by benchmarking basis set performance for a diverse set of 136 reactions (from the diet-150-GMTKN55 dataset). In our analysis, we find the distributions of errors are often significantly non-Gaussian, meaning that the joint consideration of median errors, mean absolute errors and outlier statistics is helpful to provide a holistic understanding of basis set performance. Our direct comparison of performance between most modern basis sets provides quantitative evidence for basis set recommendations that broadly align with the established understanding of basis set experts and is evident in the design of modern basis sets. For example, while zeta is a good measure of quality, it is not the only determining factor for an accurate calculation with unpolarised double and triple-zeta basis sets (like 6-31G and 6-311G) having very poor performance. Appropriate use of polarisation functions (e.g. 6-31G*) is essential to obtain the accuracy offered by double or triple zeta basis sets. In our study, the best performance in our study for double and triple zeta basis set are 6-31++G** and pcseg-2 respectively. The polarised 6-311G basis set family has poor parameterisation which means its performance is more like a double-zeta than triple-zeta basis set. All versions of the 6-311G basis set family should be avoided entirely for valence chemistry calculations moving forward.</description>

      <title>On the Specialisation of Gaussian Basis Sets for Core-Dependent Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fact that most quantum chemistry basis sets are designed for accurately modelling valence chemistry, these general-purpose basis sets continue to be widely used to model core-dependent properties. Core-specialised basis sets are designed with specific features to accurately represent the behaviour of the core region. This design typically incorporates Gaussian primitives with higher exponents to capture core behaviour effectively, as well as some decontraction of basis functions to provide flexibility in describing the core electronic wave function. The highest Gaussian exponent and the degree of contraction for both $s$- and $p$-basis functions effectively characterise these design aspects.
  In this study, we compare the design and performance of general-purpose basis sets against several literature basis sets specifically designed for three core-dependent properties: J coupling constants, hyperfine coupling constants, and magnetic shielding constants (used for calculating chemical shifts). Our findings consistently demonstrate a significant reduction in error when employing core-specialised basis sets, often at a marginal increase in computational cost compared to the popular 6-31G** basis set. Notably, for expedient calculations of J coupling, hyperfine coupling and magnetic shielding constants, we recommend the use of the pcJ-1, EPR-II, and pcSseg-1, basis sets respectively. For higher accuracy, the pcJ-2, EPR-III, and pcSseg-2 basis sets are recommended.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive reevaluation of acetaldehyde chemistry and the underlying uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the combustion chemistry of acetaldehyde is crucial to developing robust and accurate combustion chemistry models for practical fuels, especially for biofuels. This study aims to reevaluate the important rate and thermodynamic parameters for acetaldehyde combustion chemistry. The rate parameters of 79 key reactions are reevaluated using more than 100,000 direct experiments and quantum chemistry computations from &gt;900 studies, and the thermochemistry ({\Delta}hf(298K), s0(298K) and cp) of 24 key species are reevaluated based on the ATCT database, the NIST Chemistry WebBook, the TMTD database, and 35 published chemistry models. The updated parameters are incorporated into a recent acetaldehyde chemistry model, which is further assessed against available fundamental experiments (123 ignition delay times and 385 species concentrations) and existing chemistry models, with clearly better performance obtained in the high-temperature regime. Sensitivity and flux analyses further highlight the insufficiencies of previous models in representing the key pathways, particularly the branching ratios of acetaldehyde- and formaldehyde-consuming pathways. Temperature-dependent and temperature-independent uncertainties are statistically evaluated for kinetic and thermochemical parameters, respectively, where the large differences between the updated and the original model parameters reveal the necessity of reassessment of kinetic and thermochemical parameters completely based on direct experiments and theoretical calculations for rate and thermodynamic parameters.</description>

      <title>$[C_{2}mim][CH_{3}SO_{3}]$ -- A Suitable New Heat Transfer Fluid? Part 2: Thermophysical Properties of Its Mixtures with Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic liquids have proved to be excellent heat transfer fluids and alternatives to common HTFs used in industries for heat exchangers and other heat transfer equipment. However, its industrial utilization depends on the cost per kg of its production, to be competitive for industrial applications with biphenyl and diphenyl oxide, alkylated aromatics, and dimethyl polysiloxane oils, which degrade above 200 {\deg}C and possess some environmental problems. The efficiency of a heat transfer fluid depends on the fundamental thermophysical properties influencing convective heat transfer (density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity), as these properties are necessary to calculate the heat transfer coefficients for different heat exchanger geometries. In Part 1, the thermophysical properties of pure 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate $[C_{2}mim][CH_{3}SO_{3}]$ (CAS no. 145022-45-3), (ECOENG 110), produced by BASF, under the trade name of Basionics ST35, with an assay $\geq$97% with $\leq$0.5% water and $\leq$2% chloride ($Cl^{-}$), were presented, for temperatures slightly below room temperature and up to 355 K. In this paper, we report the thermophysical properties of mixtures of [C2mim][CH3SO3] with water, in the whole concentration range, at $P$ = 0.1 MPa. The properties measured were density and speed of sound (293.15 &lt; $T$/K &lt; 343.15), viscosity, electrical and thermal conductivities, refractive index (293.15 &lt; $T$/K &lt; 353.15), and infinite dilution diffusion coefficient of the ionic liquid in water (298.15 K).</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and phase equilibria for ($CO_{2}$ + $C_{3}H_{8}$) mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents phase envelope and speed of sound data for the (0.60 $CO_{2}$ + 0.40 $C_{3}H_{8}$) and (0.80 $CO_{2}$ + 0.20 $C_{3}H_{8}$) binary mixtures. Phase equilibria was measured using a cylindrical resonator working in the microwave band whereas an acoustic resonator was used for speed of sound measurements. The experimental results were compared with GERG-2008 equation of state, obtaining average absolute deviations by 0.24% in pressure for phase equilibria data and 0.025% for speed of sound data. Speed of sound values were used to derive perfect-gas heat capacities, acoustic virial coefficients, and second density virial coefficients. In addition, AGA8-DC92 equation of state performance was checked for the results derived from speeds of sound.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound data, derived perfect-gas heat capacities, and acoustic virial coefficients of a calibration standard natural gas mixture and a low-calorific $H_{2}$-enriched mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to address the technical aspects related to the thermodynamic characterization of natural gas mixtures blended with hydrogen for the introduction of alternative energy sources within the Power-to-Gas framework. For that purpose, new experimental speed of sound data are presented in the pressure range between (0.1 up to 13) MPa and at temperatures of (260, 273.16, 300, 325, and 350) K for two mixtures qualified as primary calibration standards: a 11 component synthetic natural gas mixture (11 M), and another low-calorific $H_{2}$-enriched natural gas mixture with a nominal molar percentage $x_{H_{2}}$ = 3%. Measurements have been gathered using a spherical acoustic resonator with an experimental expanded ($k$ = 2) uncertainty better than 200 parts in $10^{6}$ (0.02%) in the speed of sound. The heat capacity ratio as perfect-gas $\gamma_{pg}$, the molar heat capacity as perfect-gas $C_{p,m}^{pg}$, and the second $\beta_{a}$ and third $\gamma_{a}$ acoustic virial coefficients are derived from the speed of sound values. All the results are compared with the reference mixture models for natural gas-like mixtures, the AGA8-DC92 EoS and the GERG-2008 EoS, with special attention to the impact of hydrogen on those properties. Data are found to be mostly consistent within the model uncertainty in the 11 M synthetic mixture as expected, but for the hydrogen-enriched mixture in the limit of the model uncertainty at the highest measuring pressures.</description>

      <title>Kohn-Sham inversion with mathematical guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm including error bounds that are verified numerically in bulk silicon. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <title>Charting new regions of Cobalt's chemical space with maximally large magnetic anisotropy: A computational high-throughput study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy slows down magnetic relaxation and plays a prominent role in the design of permanent magnets. Coordination compounds of Co(II) in particular exhibit large magnetic anisotropy in the presence of low-coordination environments and have been used as single-molecule magnet prototypes. However, only a limited sampling of Cobalt's vast chemical space has been performed, potentially obscuring alternative chemical routes toward large magnetic anisotropy. Here we perform a computational high-throughput exploration of Co(II)'s chemical space in search of new single-molecule magnets. We automatically assemble a diverse set of about 15000 novel complexes of Co(II) and fully characterize them with multi-reference ab initio methods. More than 100 compounds exhibit magnetic anisotropy comparable to or larger than leading known compounds. The analysis of these results shows that compounds with record-breaking magnetic anisotropy can also be achieved with coordination four or higher, going beyond the established paradigm of two-coordinated linear complexes.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules induced by light-matter interactions is crucial for potential applications of photochemical processes, but it is challenging due to the high computational costs of exact quantum dynamics simulations. Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for exact quantum dynamics simulations by exploiting the quantum nature of the computational device. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. In this work, we present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We combined Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) and Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) for calculating the thermal rate constants of the OH + HBr system. We used the active learning (AL) algorithm for constructing a training set during RPMD. We compared the obtained RPMD-AL-MTP rate constants with the ones previously calculated using the quasi-classical trajectories (QCT) and the POTLIB potential energy surface, and with the experimental ones. We demonstrated that the RPMD rate constants were systematically closer to the experimental rate constants than the QCT ones at 200 K, 300 K, and 500 K.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Kohn-Sham potential for molecular dissociation with orbital-independent functionals: a proof of principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

      <title>Efficient Composite Infrared Spectroscopy: Combining the Doubly-Harmonic Approximation with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for molecular characterization and offers an ideal target for the computational investigation of molecular materials. Building on previous comprehensive assessments of efficient methods for infrared (IR) spectroscopy, this study investigates the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of gas-phase IR spectra calculations, accessible through a combination of modern semiempirical quantum mechanical and transferable machine learning potentials. A composite approach for IR spectra prediction based on the doubly-harmonic approximation, utilizing harmonic vibrational frequencies in combination squared derivatives of the molecular dipole moment, is employed. This approach allows for methodical flexibility in the calculation of IR intensities from molecular dipoles and the corresponding vibrational modes. Various methods are systematically tested to suggest a suitable protocol with an emphasis on computational efficiency. Among these methods, semiempirical extended tight-binding (xTB) models, classical charge equilibrium models, and machine learning potentials trained for dipole moment prediction are assessed across a diverse dataset of organic molecules. We particularly focus on the recently reported machine learning potential MACE-OFF23 to address the accuracy limitations of conventional low-cost quantum mechanical and force-field methods. This study aims to establish a standard for the efficient computational prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the rapid and reliable identification of unknown compounds and advancing automated analytical workflows in chemistry.</description>

Abstract: On-demand control of molecular actions is a crucial step toward the realization of single-molecule functional devices. Such a control can be achieved by manipulating interactions between individual molecules and their nanoscale environment. In this study, we induce and manipulate the conformational transition of a single molecular adsorbate by exciting its vibrations with tunneling electrons using scanning tunneling microscopy. Several transition pathways between two structural states of a pyrrolidine molecule on a Cu(100) surface have been identified as being driven by different molecular vibrations. Density functional theory simulations further determine the nuclear motions of these vibrational modes. The introduction of tip-induced van der Waals forces and intermolecular interactions allows for precise manipulation of the molecule-environment interaction, which shifts the vibrational energies and alters the transition probability through different channels between the two structural states. This work reveals how molecular conformational transitions can be modulated by external force fields in a tunable nano-cavity, highlighting the potential to deliberately engineer molecule-environment interactions for specific molecular functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetite(001)/water interface from molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>
