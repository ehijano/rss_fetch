      <title>Discrete-time systems in quasi-standard form and the $\mathfrak{h}_6$ coalgebra symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize all discrete-time systems in quasi-standard form admitting coalgebra symmetry with respect to the Lie--Poisson algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$. The outcome of this study is a family of systems depending on an arbitrary function of three variables, playing the r\^ole of the potential. Moreover, using a direct search approach, we classify discrete-time systems from this family that admit an additional invariant at most quadratic in the physical variables. We discuss the integrability properties of the obtained cases, their relationship with known systems, and their continuum limits.</description>

      <title>Classification of non-homogeneous multidimensional Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hamiltonian operators which are sum of a first order operator and of a Poisson tensor, in two spatial independent variables. In particular, a complete classification of these operators is presented in two and three components, analyzing both the cases of degenerate and non degenerate leading coefficients.</description>

      <title>Which Meyer sets are regular model sets? A characterization via almost periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2012, Meyer introduced the notions of generalized almost periodic measure and almost periodic pattern and proved that regular model sets in Euclidean space are almost periodic patterns. Here, we prove the converse in a slightly more general setting. Specifically, we show that a Meyer set in any $\sigma$-compact locally compact abelian group is a regular model set if and only if it is an almost periodic pattern.</description>

      <title>Enhanced binding for a quantum particle coupled to scalar quantized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum particle coupled to a scalar quantized field, such as the regularized Nelson model. We show that there are situations where the Hamiltonian of the particle alone does not have a bound state, while the particle--field Hamiltonian has a ground state. This complements results for other models such as the Pauli--Fierz model, where such results have been shown. When the uncoupled quantum particle already has a bound state, we show that this bound state persists when coupling the particle to the field, for any coupling strength. This was known previously only for small enough coupling. Our results use the functional integral representation and rely on a recent method using the Gaussian correlation inequality.</description>

      <title>Revealing Noncanonical Hamiltonian Structures in Relativistic Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the noncanonical Hamiltonian structure of the relativistic Euler equations for a perfect fluid in Minkowski spacetime. By identifying the system's noncanonical Poisson bracket and Hamiltonian, we show that relativistic fluid flows preserve helicity and enstrophy as conserved quantities in three-dimensional and two-dimensional cases, respectively. This holds when the fluid follows a relativistic $\gamma$-barotropic equation of state, which generalizes the classical barotropic condition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these conserved quantities are Casimir invariants associated with the noncanonical Poisson structure. These findings open new avenues for applying Hamiltonian theory to the study of astrophysical fluids and relativistic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Hankel Determinants for a Deformed Laguerre Weight with Multiple Variables and Generalized Painlev\'{e} V Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hankel determinant generated by the moments of the deformed Laguerre weight function $x^{\alpha}{\rm{e}}^{-x}\prod\limits_{k=1}^{N}(x+t_k)^{\lambda_k}$, where $x\in \left[0,+\infty \right)$, $\alpha,t_k &gt;0, \lambda_k\in\mathbb{R}$ for $k=1,\cdots ,N$. By using the ladder operators for the associated monic orthogonal polynomials and three compatibility conditions, we express the recurrence coefficients in terms of the $2N$ auxiliary quantities which are introduced in the ladder operators and shown to satisfy a system of difference equations. Combining these results with the differential identities obtained from the differentiation of the orthogonality relations, we deduce the Riccati equations for the auxiliary quantities. From them we establish a system of second order PDEs which are reduced to a Painlev\'{e} V equation for $N=1$. Moreover, we derive the second order PDE satisfied by the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant, from which the limiting PDE is obtained under a double scaling. When $N=1$, these two PDEs are reduced to the $\sigma$-form of a Painlev\'{e} V and III equation respectively. When the dimension of the Hermitian matrices from the corresponding deformed Laguerre unitary ensemble is large and $\lambda_k\ge0$, based on Dyson's Coulomb fluid theory, we deduce the equilibrium density for the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Winding Number Statistics for Chiral Random Matrices: Universal Correlations and Statistical Moments in the Unitary Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The winding number is the topological invariant that classifies chiral symmetric Hamiltonians with one-dimensional parametric dependence. In this work we complete our study of the winding number statistics in a random matrix model belonging to the chiral unitary class AIII. We show that in the limit of large matrix dimensions the winding number distribution becomes Gaussian. Our results include expressions for the statistical moments of the winding number and for the k-point correlation function of the winding number density.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of overlooked trigonometric-like functions is explored in this article, along with the relevant applications in applications. We show indeed that Taylor series, resembling that of an ordinary cosine, are representative of wider classes of functions, naturally suited for prolems ranging from molecular to Laser Physics. The article goes through the original motivations of the proposal and studies the relevant properties within the context of an Umbral interpretation. Their use in applications is discussed within the framework of Free Electron Laser theory, Lennard- Jones potentials and Kramers-Kronig causality identities</description>

      <title>Derivation of Hartree theory for two-dimensional trapped Bose gases in almost Gross-Pitaevskii regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of trapped two-dimensional Bose gases with mean-field type interactions. We prove the stability of second kind of the many-body system and the convergence of the ground state energy per particle to that of a non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) energy functional. Notably, we can take the scaling of the interaction to be arbitrarily close to the Gross-Pitaevskii scaling, which is a drastic improvement on the best-known result for systems with attractive interactions. As a consequence of the stability of second kind we also obtain Bose-Einstein condensation for the many-body ground states and dynamics for a much improved range of the diluteness parameter.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky to the case of a nested coisotropic embedding $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$.
  To this, we naturally assign the coisotropic reductions $\pi\colon C\to \underline{C}$, as well as $\pi_\circ\colon C_\circ\to\underline{C_\circ}$ and the residual reduction $\pi_{\mathrm{res}}\colon C_{\mathrm{res}}\to \underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}$, where $C_{\mathrm{res}}=\pi_\circ(C)\hookrightarrow \underline{C_\circ}$ is the residual coisotropic embedding such that $\underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}\simeq \underline{C}$.
  We show that there is a relation between the BFV resolutions of $\underline{C_\circ}$ and $\underline{C}$, in terms of a graded coisotropic embedding, which can further be resolved via BFV.
  We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction". We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}\simeq\underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}$, from a quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold following the quantum BFV prescription (when it exists). As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of \emph{majorization} relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of bistochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove new exact finite-$n$ results in the case of \emph{UT-majorization} relation, i.e.,\ when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

These addition theorems involve sums over the azimuthal quantum number of products of two spin-weighted spherical harmonics at different points on the two-sphere, either (or both) of which are differentiated with respect to one of their arguments.</description>

Abstract: We explore the meromorphic structure of the $\zeta$-function associated to the boundary eigenvalue problem of a modified Sturm-Liouville operator subject to spectral dependent boundary conditions at one end of a segment of length $l$. We find that it presents isolated simple poles which follow the general rule valid for second order differential operators subject to standard local boundary conditions. We employ our results to evaluate the determinant of the operator and the Casimir energy of the system it describes, and study its dependence on $l$ for both the massive and the massless cases.</description>

      <title>On the Meissner state for type-II inhomogeneous superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider extreme type-II superconductors modeled by the Ginzburg--Landau energy with a pinning term $a_\varepsilon(x)$, which we assume to be a bounded measurable function such that $b\leq a_\varepsilon(x)\leq 1$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. A crucial feature of this type of superconductors is the occurrence of vortices, which appear above the so-called first critical field $H_{c_1}$. In this paper we estimate this value and characterize the behavior of the Meissner solution, the unique vortexless configuration that globally minimizes the energy below $H_{c_1}$. In addition, we show that beyond this value, for applied fields whose strength is slightly below the so-called superheating field $H_{sh}$, there exists a unique Meissner-type solution that locally minimizes the energy.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the simplest case of tt*-Toda equations, we study the large and small $x$ asymptotics for $x&gt;0$ of real solutions of the sinh-Godron Painlev\'e III($D_6$) equation. These solutions are parametrized through the monodromy data of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. This unified approach provides connection formulae between the behavior at the origin and infinity of the considered solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multiparameter version of the quantum universal enveloping superalgebras introduced by Yamane in [H. Yamane, "Quantized enveloping algebras associated to simple Lie superalgebras and their universal $R$-matrices", Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 30 (1994), no. 1, 15-87]. For these objects we consider:
  - (1) their deformations by twist and by 2-cocycle (both of "toral type"); in particular, we prove that this family is stable under both types of deformations;
  - (2) their semiclassical limits, which are multiparameter Lie superbialgebras;
  - (3) the deformations by twist and by 2-cocycle (of "toral type") of these multiparameter Lie superbialgebras: in particular, we prove that this family is stable under these deformations, and that "quantization commutes with deformation".</description>

      <title>The Larkin Mass and Replica Symmetry Breaking in the Elastic Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of a series of three papers about the Elastic Manifold model. This classical model proposes a rich picture due to the competition between the inherent disorder and the smoothing effect of elasticity. In this paper, we analyze our variational formula for the free energy obtained in our first companion paper [16]. We show that this variational formula may be simplified to one which is solved by a unique saddle point. We show that this saddle point may be solved for in terms of the corresponding critical point equation. Moreover, its terms may be interpreted in terms of natural statistics of the model: namely the overlap distribution and effective radius of the model at a given site. Using this characterization, obtain a complete characterization of the replica symmetry breaking phase. From this we are able to confirm a number of physical predictions about this boundary, namely those involving the Larkin mass [6, 53, 54], an important critical mass for the system. The zero-temperature Larkin mass has recently been shown to be the topological trivialization threshold, following work of Fyodorov and Le Doussal [37, 38], made rigorous by the first author, Bourgade and McKenna [12, 13].</description>

      <title>Bosonization and correlators of the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simple derivation of the Luttinger liquid relation for the 1D Hubbard model both for finite $U$ and in the $U=\infty$ limit. We describe the simple solution of the Hubbard model in the infinite repulsion limit and use it to calculate the correlators of the model in this limit in a simple and a physical way using the Bosonization technique. We then calculate the asymptotics of the correlators of the model at arbitrary $U$ through the single parameter, which can be calculated from the Bethe Ansatz solution. Our derivation of the critical exponents is simple and allows one to express different physical operators of the Hubbard model through the charge and spin Bose fields in a direct and a physically transparent way.</description>

      <title>High-genus KdV soliton gases and their long-time asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper employs the Riemann-Hilbert problem to provide a comprehensive analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the high-genus Korteweg-de Vries soliton gases. It is demonstrated that the two-genus soliton gas is related to the two-phase Riemann-Theta function as \(x \to +\infty\), and approaches to zero as \(x \to -\infty\). Additionally, the long-time asymptotic behavior of this two-genus soliton gas can be categorized into five distinct regions in the \(x\)-\(t\) plane, which from left to right are rapidly decay, modulated one-phase wave, unmodulated one-phase wave, modulated two-phase wave, and unmodulated two-phase wave. Moreover, an innovative method is introduced to solve the model problem associated with the high-genus Riemann surface, leading to the determination of the leading terms, which is also related with the multi-phase Riemann-Theta function. A general discussion on the case of arbitrary \(N\)-genus soliton gas is also presented.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic behaviors of acoustic waves due to high-contrast material inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behaviors of time-harmonic acoustic waves generated by an incident wave illuminating inhomogeneous medium inclusions with high-contrast material parameters. We derive sharp asymptotic estimates and obtain several effective acoustic obstacle scattering models when the material parameters take extreme values. The results clarify the connection between inhomogeneous medium scattering and obstacle scattering for acoustic waves, providing a clear criterion for identifying the boundary conditions of acoustic obstacles in practice. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of the classical sound-hard and sound-soft obstacle scattering models. We demonstrate that a sound-hard obstacle can be viewed as an inhomogeneous medium inclusion with infinite mass density, while a sound-soft obstacle corresponds to an inclusion with zero mass density and zero bulk modulus. Second, we introduce two novel acoustic obstacle scattering models when the mass density of the inclusion degenerates to zero. These new models offer a fresh perspective on considering inhomogeneous medium inclusions with high-contrast material parameters.</description>

      <title>Comparison of arm exponents in planar FK-percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the FKG inequality for FK-percolation, the probability of the alternating two-arm event is smaller than the product of the probabilities of having a primal arm and a dual arm, respectively. In this paper, we improve this inequality by a polynomial factor for critical planar FK-percolation in the continuous phase transition regime ($1 \leq q \leq 4$). In particular, we prove that if the alternating two-arm exponent $\alpha_{01}$ and the one-arm exponents $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ exist, then they satisfy the strict inequality $\alpha_{01} &gt; \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$. The question was formulated by Christophe Garban and Jeffrey E. Steif (2014) in the context of exceptional times and was brought to our attention by Ritvik Ramanan Radhakrishnan and Vincent Tassion, who obtained the same result for planar Bernoulli percolation through different methods.</description>

      <title>On exact overlaps of integrable matrix product states: inhomogeneities, twists and dressing formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invoking a quantum dressing procedure as well as the representation theory of twisted Yangians we derive a number of summation formulas for the overlap between integrable matrix product states and Bethe eigenstates which involve only eigenvalues of fused transfer matrices and which are valid in the presence of inhomogeneities as well as twists. Although the method is general we specialize to the $SO(6)$ spin chain for which integrable matrix product states corresponding to evaluation representations of the twisted Yangian $Y^+(4)$ encode the information about one-point functions of the D3-D5 domain wall version of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Considering the untwisted and homogeneous limit of our summation formulas we finally fill the last gap in the analytical understanding of the overlap formula for the $SO(6$) sector of the D3-D5 domain wall system.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, with Drago and Pinamonti we have introduced a Wetterich-type flow equation for scalar fields on Lorentzian manifolds, using the algebraic approach to perturbative QFT. The equation governs the flow of the effective average action, under changes of a mass parameter k. Here we introduce an analogous flow equation for gauge theories, with the aid of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We also show that the corresponding effective average action satisfies a Slavnov-Taylor identity in Zinn-Justin form. We interpret the equation as a cohomological constraint on the functional form of the effective average action, and we show that it is consistent with the flow.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hankel determinant generated by the Gaussian weight with jump discontinuities at $t_1,\cdots,t_m$. By making use of a pair of ladder operators satisfied by the associated monic orthogonal polynomials and three supplementary conditions, we show that the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant satisfies a second order partial differential equation which is reduced to the $\sigma$-form of a Painlev\'{e} IV equation when $m=1$. Moreover, under the assumption that $t_k-t_1$ is fixed for $k=2,\cdots,m$, by considering the Riemann-Hilbert problem for the orthogonal polynomials, we construct direct relationships between the auxiliary quantities introduced in the ladder operators and solutions of a coupled Painlev\'{e} IV system.</description>

Abstract: We develop the study of a particular class of biorthogonal measures, encompassing at the same time several random matrix models and partition functions of polymers. This general framework allows us to characterize the partition functions of the Log Gamma polymer and the mixed polymer in terms of explicit biorthogonal measures, as it was previously done for the homogeneous O'Connell-Yor polymer by Imamura and Sasamoto. In addition, we show that the biorthogonal measures associated to these three polymer models (Log Gamma, O'Connell-Yor, and mixed polymer) converge to random matrix eigenvalue distributions in small temperature limits. We also clarify the connection between different Fredholm determinant representations and explain how our results might be useful for asymptotic analysis and large deviation estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

      <title>Construction of Gross-Neveu model using Polchinski flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions in two dimensions with a quartic interaction term. Like Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, the model is scaling critical (i.e. renormalizable but not super-renormalizable) and asymptotically free (i.e. its short-distance behavior is governed by the free theory). We give a new construction of the massive Euclidean Gross-Neveu model in infinite volume. The distinctive feature of the construction is that it does not involve cluster expansion, discretization of phase-space or a tree expansion ansatz and is based solely on the renormalization group flow equation. We express the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model in terms of the effective potential and construct the effective potential by solving the flow equation using the Banach fixed point theorem. Moreover, we construct a random field in the probability space of the free field such that its moments coincide with the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model. This is the first construction of a strong coupling between the free and interacting fields for a scaling-critical QFT. Since we use crucially the fact that fermionic fields can be represented as bounded operators our construction does not extend to models including bosons. However, it is applicable to other asymptotically free purely fermionic theories such as the symplectic fermion model.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>

Abstract: Finite real spectral triples are defined to characterise the non-commutative geometry of a fuzzy torus. The geometries are the non-commutative analogues of flat tori with moduli determined by integer parameters. Each of these geometries has four different Dirac operators, corresponding to the four unique spin structures on a torus. The spectrum of the Dirac operator is calculated. It is given by replacing integers with their quantum integer analogues in the spectrum of the corresponding commutative torus.</description>

Abstract: We study the degenerate linear Boltzmann equation inside a bounded domain with the Maxwell and the Cercignani-Lampis boundary conditions, two generalizations of the diffuse reflection, with variable temperature. Our abstract collisional setting includes the relaxation towards a space-dependent steady state, and the case where the collision kernel has heavy tails. For both boundary conditions, we prove for the first time the existence of a steady state and a rate of convergence towards it without assumptions on the temperature variations. Our results for the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition make also no hypotheses on the accommodation coefficients. The proven rate is exponential when a control condition on the degeneracy of the collision operator is satisfied, and only polynomial when this assumption is not met, in line with our previous results regarding the free-transport equation. We also provide a precise description of the different convergence rates, including lower bounds, when the steady state is bounded. Our method yields constructive constants.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, then it was recently shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not if $3 \le p \le \infty$. In the third kind resonance case, we also show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generically unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. Moreover, it is also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has the zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonances and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \R^3$.
  These results describe precisely the validity of the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold with some exceptions for the endpoint cases $p=1,\infty$. As an application, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are also derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <title>Anti-symmetric and Positivity Preserving Formulation of a Spectral Method for Vlasov-Poisson Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the anti-symmetric properties of a spectral discretization for the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. The discretization is based on a spectral expansion in velocity with the symmetrically weighted Hermite basis functions, central finite differencing in space, and an implicit Runge Kutta integrator in time. The proposed discretization preserves the anti-symmetric structure of the advection operator in the Vlasov equation, resulting in a stable numerical method. We apply such discretization to two formulations: the canonical Vlasov-Poisson equations and their continuously transformed square-root representation. The latter preserves the positivity of the particle distribution function. We derive analytically the conservation properties of both formulations, including particle number, momentum, and energy, which are verified numerically on the following benchmark problems: manufactured solution, linear and nonlinear Landau damping, two-stream instability, bump-on-tail instability, and ion-acoustic wave.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian structures of WDVV-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear PDEs that admit the same bi-Hamiltonian structure as WDVV equations: a Ferapontov-type first-order Hamiltonian operator and a homogeneous third-order Hamiltonian operator in a canonical Doyle--Potemin form, which are compatible. Using various equivalence groups, we classify such equations in two-component and three-component cases. In a four-component case, we add further evidence to the conjecture that there exists only one integrable system of the above type. Finally, we give an example of the six-component system with required bi-Hamiltonian structure. To streamline the symbolic computation we develop an algorithm to find the aforementioned Hamiltonian operators, which includes putting forward a conjecture on the structure of the metric parameterising the first-order Hamiltonian operator.</description>

      <title>A concrete construction of a topological operator in factorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factorization algebras play a central role in the formulation of quantum field theories given by Kevin Costello and his collaborators. In this paper, we propose a concrete construction of a topological operator in their formulation. We focus on a shift symmetry of a one-dimensional massless scalar theory. And we give some discussions of $\mathbb{Z}$-gauging of it, i.e., compact scalar theory and its $\theta$-vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Fr\'echet--Lie groups of the form $C^{\infty}(M)\rtimes \mathbb{R}$ resulting from smooth flows on compact manifolds $M$ fail to be locally exponential in several cases: when at least one non-periodic orbit is locally closed, or when the flow restricts to a linear one on an orbit closure diffeomorphic to a torus. As an application, we prove that the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group of symmetries of an asymptotically flat space-time is not locally exponential.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>The Feyn-Structure of Yangian Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yangian-type differential operators are shown to constrain Feynman integrals beyond the restriction to integrable graphs. In particular, we prove that all position-space Feynman diagrams at tree level feature a Yangian level-one momentum symmetry as long as their external coordinates are distinct. This symmetry is traced back to a set of more elementary bilocal operators, which annihilate the integrals. In dual momentum space, the considered Feynman graphs represent multi-loop integrals without `loops of loops', generalizing for instance the family of so-called train track or train track network diagrams. The extension of these results to integrals with massive propagators on the boundary of the Feynman graph is established. When specializing to the dual conformal case, where propagator powers sum up to the spacetime dimension at each position-space vertex, the symmetry extends to the full dual conformal Yangian. Hence, our findings represent a generalization of the statements on the Yangian symmetry of Feynman integrals beyond integrability and reveal its origin lying in a set of more elementary bilocal annihilators. Previous applications of the Yangian suggest to employ the resulting differential equations for bootstrapping multi-loop integrals beyond the dual conformal case. The considered bilocal constraints on Feynman integrals resemble the definition of conformal partial waves via Casimir operators, but are based on a different algebraic structure.</description>
