      <title>A Unified Framework of Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models that were proposed to inherently address the issue of material instability or existence of zero-energy modes in the conventional correspondence formulation. The conventional formulation is well-known for having the issue of material instability due to the non-unique mapping between bond force density state and nonlocal deformation gradient. Several bond-associated models that employ bond-level deformation gradients address this issue in a very effectively and inherent manner. Although different approaches were taken to formulate bond-level deformation gradient so the bond-associated quantities can be captured more accurately, a detailed study finds a unified systematic framework exists for these models. It is the purpose of this paper to consolidate these approaches by providing a unified and systematic framework for bond-associated peridynamic correspondence models. Based on all the bond-associated deformation gradients proposed in the literature, a unified bond-associated deformation gradient is formulated. Assuming energy equivalence with the local continuum mechanics theory, the unified bond force density state is derived using the Fr\'echet derivative. Additionally, the properties of the formulated unified framework including linear momentum balance, angular momentum balance, and objectivity are thoroughly examined. This work serves as a valuable reference for the further development and application of bond-associated correspondence formulations in peridynamics.</description>

      <title>Sub-Bragg Phenomena in Multilayered Vibroacoustic Phononic Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond classical Bragg diffraction, we report on new sub-Bragg phenomena to achieve enhanced sound wave tunability in the low-frequency range in a multilayered acoustic metamaterial system. Remarkably, we reveal and study the formation of genuinely sub-wavelength Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps, generalizing the band-folding induced bandgaps in the literature. Additionally, we propose a methodology to widen sub-wavelength local resonance bandgaps by simultaneously hosting two local resonances within the same bandgap. These sub-Bragg bandgaps are realized in an axisymmetric vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial consisting of repetitive multilayered unit cells, each composed of two layers of membrane-cavity resonators. The resulting coupled sound-structure interaction system is analytically solved in closed form. Furthermore, the studied multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial exhibits sub-wavelength acoustical transparency, akin to electromagnetically induced transparency, and an acoustic analogue of low-frequency plasma oscillations, resulting in a plasma bandgap where wave propagation is entirely prohibited below the plasma frequency. These sub-wavelength phenomena, achieved predictively and well below the ubiquitous first-order Bragg diffraction range, provide broadband attenuation and superior wave manipulation capabilities for low-frequency sound. This highlights the potential of utilizing sound-structure interaction across diverse physical applications. Moreover, our findings can be extrapolated to wave propagation in broader classes of physical systems where sub-wavelength phenomena are crucial, including phononic and photonic crystals of more general configurations.</description>

      <title>The Resonance Condition for Slow Wave Antennas: a Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proof of the resonant property of linear periodically loaded antennas with subwavelength elements is obtained by applying a Lagrangian formalism. A Lagrangian is developed by modeling the antenna with lumped inductance and capacitance elements on a single line, thereby physically similar to the antenna and thus avoiding the inaccurate two parallel conductor transmission line model. An equation for the antenna current driven by an incident electromagnetic field is obtained via vector and scalar potentials. It is shown that periodic loading provides a means to shorten the resonant length while the antenna pattern remains unchanged. The Lagrangian model is validated through a calculation showing the loaded resonant length is determined by a product of a resonant half-wavelength dipole with the ratio of the free space velocity and the longitudinal traveling wave velocity. A periodically loaded disk-on-rod antenna example with simulations and measurements provides further validation of the mathematics.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections and criticality in the $d = 3$ Blume-Capel model: Results from small-scale Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the critical and tricritical points of the three-dimensional Blume-Capel model by analyzing the behavior of the first Lee-Yang zero, the density of partition function zeros, and higher-order cumulants of the magnetization. Our analysis is conducted through Monte Carlo simulations, intentionally using only small system sizes. We demonstrate that this approach yields excellent results for studying the critical behavior of the model. Our findings indicate that at the tricritical point, where logarithmic corrections are anticipated, the numerical results align closely with the theoretical exponents describing these corrections. These expected values are then employed to accurately determine the coordinates of the tricritical point. At the model's critical point, the corrections correspond to those of the three-dimensional Ising model criticality, which we also use to precisely ascertain the critical temperature at zero crystal field. Additionally, we utilize more traditional thermodynamic quantities to validate the self-consistency of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Flexures for Kibble balances: Minimizing the effects of anelastic relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the anelastic aftereffect of a flexure being used in a Kibble balance, where the flexure is subjected to a large excursion in velocity mode after which a high-precision force comparison is performed. We investigated the effect of a constant and a sinusoidal excursion on the force comparison. We explored theoretically and experimentally a simple erasing procedure, i.e., bending the flexure in the opposite direction for a given amplitude and time. We found that the erasing procedure reduced the time-dependent force by about 30%. The investigation was performed with an analytical model and verified experimentally with our new Kibble balance at the National Institute of Standards and Technology employing flexures made from precipitation-hardened Copper Beryllium alloy C17200. Our experimental determination of the modulus defect of the flexure yields 1.2E-4. This result is about a factor of two higher than previously reported from experiments. We additionally found a static shift of the flexure's internal equilibrium after a change in the stress and strain state. These static shifts, although measurable, are small and deemed uncritical for our Kibble balance application at present. During this investigation, we discovered magic flexures that promise to have very little anelastic relaxation. In these magic flexures, the mechanism causing anelastic relaxation is compensated for by properly shaping and loading a flexure with a non-constant cross-section in the region of bending.</description>

      <title>Study of the asymptotic motion of a sporting projectile taking into account the Magnus force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classic problem of the motion of a projectile thrown at an angle to the horizon is studied. Air resistance force and Magnus force are taken into account with the use of the quadratic laws. We consider the asymptotic motion of the projectile, i.e., the motion on a sufficiently large time interval. The equations of motion are written both in Cartesian coordinates and in natural axes. The aim of the study is the analytical determination of the characteristics of asymptotic motion - the limiting angle of inclination of the trajectory to the horizontal and the terminal velocity, and obtaining an analytical representation for the velocity hodograph. No restrictions are imposed on the initial throwing conditions and other parameters. The equations of motion in Cartesian coordinates are used to find the angle of inclination of the trajectory and the terminal velocity. The equations of motion in natural axes are used to determine velocity hodograph. The velocity hodograph is defined in the form an approximate implicit analytical formula linking the trajectory angle of the projectile to its velocity. The motion of a golf ball, is presented as example. Numerical calculations show a complete coincidence of analytically found values of required quantities with numerically found values. The proposed analytical formulas can be useful for all researchers of this classical problem</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem of Analytical Mechanics for the Second Law Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>
