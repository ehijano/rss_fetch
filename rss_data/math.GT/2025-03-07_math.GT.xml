      <title>Filling systems of maximum size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be a closed orientable surface of genus $g\geq 2$. A collection $\Omega = \{ \gamma_1, \dots, \gamma_s\}$ of pairwise non-homotopic simple closed curves on $S_g$ such that $\gamma_i$ and $\gamma_j$ are in minimal position, is called a \emph{filling system} or a \emph{filling} of $S_g$ if the complement $S_g\setminus \Omega$ is a disjoint union of $b$ topological discs for some $b\geq 1$. The \emph{size} of a filling system is defined as the number of its elements. We prove that the maximum size of a filling system on $S_g$ with $ 1 \leq b \leq 2g-2$ boundary components is $2g+b-1$. Furthermore, we give a lower bound on mapping class group orbits of filling systems of maximum size with $ 1 \leq b \leq g-2$ boundary components.</description>

      <title>Link concordance implies link homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that link concordance implies link homotopy for immersions of codimension at least two. As a consequence, we prove that every link $\sqcup^r S^n \hookrightarrow S^{n+2}$ is link homotopically trivial for $n\geq 2$, that is, there is a {\em link} homotopy that (for each time parameter) maps distinct component $n$-spheres disjointly into $S^{n+2}$. In other words, beyond the classical dimension (of embedded circles in $S^3$) there are no `linking modulo knotting' phenomena in codimension two. To date, this was only known for $n=2$.
  In our proofs we follow, expand, and complete unpublished notes of the third author developing stratified Morse theory for generic immersions, where the $d$-th stratum is given by points that have $d$ preimages under the generic immersion. We discuss gradient like vector fields, their strata preserving flows, and Cerf theory. This generalizes the case of embeddings, as studied by Perron, Sharpe, and Rourke, and expanded by the first two authors.
  Two vital operations in Cerf theory are the rearrangement and cancellation of critical points. In the setting of stratified theory, there are additional rearrangement and cancellation obstructions arising from intersections of ascending and descending membranes for critical points of the Morse function restricted to various strata.
  We show that both additional obstructions vanish in codimension at least three, implying a smooth proof of Hudson's result that embedded concordance implies isotopy. In codimension at least two, we show that only the rearrangement obstruction vanishes and we introduce finger moves that eliminate the cancellation obstruction. This is done carefully and only at the expense of introducing new self-intersection points into the components of the immersion. Therefore, our moves keep distinct components disjoint and hence preserve the link homotopy class.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with weakly reducible genus-three trisections are standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings stratify 3-manifolds by complexity; only $S^3$ admits a genus-zero splitting, and only $S^3$, $S^1 \times S^2$, and lens spaces $L(p,q)$ admit genus-one splittings. In dimension four, the second author and Jeffrey Meier proved that only a handful of simply-connected 4-manifolds have trisection genus two or less, while Meier conjectured that if $X$ admits a genus-three trisection, then $X$ is diffeomorphic to a spun lens space $S_p$ or its sibling $S_p'$, $S^4$, or a connected sum of copies of $\pm \mathbb{CP}^2$, $S^1 \times S^3$, and $S^2 \times S^2$. We prove Meier's conjecture in the case that $X$ admits a weakly reducible genus-three trisection, where weak reducibility is a new idea adapted from Heegaard theory and is defined in terms of disjoint curves bounding compressing disks in various handlebodies. The tools and techniques used to prove the main theorem borrow heavily from 3-manifold topology. Of independent interest, we give a trisection-diagrammatic description of 4-manifolds obtained by surgery on loops and spheres in other 4-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Periodic Inscription of Isosceles Trapezoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a pair of continuous disjoint periodic curves in $\mathbb{C}$ inscribes an isosceles trapezoid with any similarity type. The case of smooth curves can be identified with a Lagrangian intersection problem for a pair of Lagrangian cylinders in $\mathbb{R}\times S^1\times\mathbb{C}$, and the continuous case follows from the smooth one by a standard convergence argument.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of infinite inversive distance circle packings in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2004, Bowers-Stephenson [2] introduced the inversive distance circle packings as a natural generalization of Thurston's circle packings. They further conjectured the rigidity of infinite inversive distance circle packings in the plane. Motivated by the recent work of Luo-Sun-Wu [22] on Luo's vertex scaling, we prove Bower-Stephenson's conjecture for inversive distance circle packings in the hexagonal triangulated plane. This generalizes Rodin-Sullivan's famous result [13] on the rigidity of infinite tangential circle packings in the hexagonal triangulated plane. The key tools include a maximal principle for generic weighted Delaunay inversive distance circle packings and a ring lemma for the inversive distance circle packings in the hexagonal triangulated plane.</description>

      <title>On contact cosmetic surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the contact cosmetic surgery conjecture holds true for all non-trivial Legendrian knots, with the possible exception of Lagrangian slice knots. We also discuss the contact cosmetic surgeries on Legendrian unknots and make the surprising observation that there are some Legendrian unknots that have a contact surgery with no cosmetic pair, while all other contact surgeries are contactomorphic to infinitely many other contact surgeries on the knot.</description>

      <title>Corks, exotic 4-manifolds and genus functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every 4-dimensional oriented handlebody without 3- and 4-handles can be modified to admit infinitely many exotic smooth structures, and further that their genus functions are pairwise equivalent. We furthermore show that, for any 4-manifold admitting an embedding into a symplectic 4-manifold with weakly convex boundary, its genus function is algebraically realized as those of infinitely many pairwise exotic 4-manifolds. We also prove that, for any two 4-manifolds with non-degenerate intersection forms, algebraic inequivalences of genus functions are stable under connected sums and boundary sums with a certain type of 4-manifolds having arbitrarily large second Betti numbers. Furthermore, we show that similar results hold for any diffeomorphism invariant of ``genus function type''. As an application of our exotic 4-manifolds, we also prove that for any (possibly non-orientable) 4-manifold, every submanifold of codimension less than two satisfying a mild condition can be modified into infinitely many exotically knotted submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Genus one singularities in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for certain one-parameter families of initial conditions in $\mathbb R^3$, when we run mean curvature flow, a genus one singularity must appear in one of the flows. Moreover, such a singularity is robust under perturbation of the family of initial conditions. This contrasts sharply with the case of just a single flow. As an application, we construct an embedded, genus one self-shrinker with entropy lower than a shrinking doughnut.</description>

      <title>New recursion formula for the interior polynomial based on non-expanding sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interior polynomial was originally defined for hypergraphs and later shown to coincide with the Ehrhart polynomial of the root polytope of an associated bipartite graph. In previous work, we derived an alternating cycle recursion formula for the interior polynomial. Here, we introduce a new, more transparent recursion formula based on the structure of non-expanding sets. This formula offers a clearer combinatorial interpretation of the interior polynomial and its connection to polyhedral geometry.</description>
