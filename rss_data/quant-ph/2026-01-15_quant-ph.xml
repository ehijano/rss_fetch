      <title>Nonclassicality of multi-photon-added cat states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon-added cat states are constructed by repeatedly applying the creation operator to a cat state. We study in detail their photon-number distribution, $Q$ parameter, squeezing properties, and Wigner function. We show that photon addition induces a $\pi$ phase shift in the original parity configuration whenever an odd number of photons is added, reflected as swapped vanishing probabilities and phase space displacements at the origin. Remarkably, the same process drives these states into a sub-Poissonian regime regardless of the relative phase between their coherent state components, making them valuable resources for quantum imaging, at the cost of losing quadrature squeezing, but gaining amplitude-squared one. We also discuss how these states can be generated using existing hardware.</description>

      <title>A 10 Megahertz Spatial Light Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and programmable shaping of light fields is central to modern microscopy, display technologies, optical communications and sensing, quantum engineering, and quantum information processing. Current wavefront shaping technologies face a fundamental dichotomy: spatial light modulators (SLMs) offer high pixel count but suffer from low refresh rates, while acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) provide moderate speed with restricted optical beam geometries. Though recent advances in photonic integrated circuits achieve fast switching, there is currently no tool that provides MHz-rate, continuous motion, and arbitrarily reconfigurable control over a set of diffraction-limited spots. Here we introduce a new class of spatial light modulator that provides both 2D pixel geometry and high speed. The device operates by encoding spatial information in frequency bins via a broadband optical phase modulator, and decoding them via a first-of-its-kind, high-resolution 2D spectrometer. The spectrometer, based on the architecture which we call the Re-Imaging Phased Array (RIPA), achieves its sensitivity through long path-lengths, enabled by intra-spectrometer re-imaging lens-guides. We demonstrate site-resolved optical pulsing with a 44(1)~ns rise time, corresponding to frame rates exceeding 10 million frames per second, as well as arbitrary, reconfigurable 2D addressing and multi-site operations, including asynchronous, independent beam motion, splitting, and recombination. Leveraging these tools opens new horizons in rapid optical manipulation of matter across science, from fast, scalable control that approaches the inertial and radiation limits of atoms in quantum processors, to dynamically programmable, microsecond-resolved illumination in microscopy and neuro-biological imaging.</description>

      <title>Superadditivity of Zero-Error Capacity in Noisy Classical and Perfect Quantum Channel Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate superadditivity of one-shot zero-error classical capacity in an asymmetric communication setting where a noisy classical channel is used in parallel with a perfect quantum channel. Each channel individually supports only a fixed number of perfectly distinguishable messages. Their joint use enables transmission of strictly more messages than permitted by the product of the individual capacities. We present explicit constructions achieving this enhancement and establish that replacing the perfect quantum channel with a perfect classical channel eliminates the effect. Finally, we identify a structural criterion on the noisy channel governing this effect and show that the quantum advantage is rooted in Kochen-Specker contextuality.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous nondestructive measurement of many polar molecules using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tweezer arrays of polar molecules present new opportunities for quantum science and quantum information. However, a major challenge, especially in bialkali molecule platforms, is the fact that current measurement schemes for the internal states are destructive. In this work, we present a method to use Rydberg atoms to nondestructively measure the internal state of a molecular qubit. We achieve this via microwave dressing of both molecules and Rydberg atoms, allowing us to tune the interactions so that there are minimal Rydberg-Rydberg interactions and many measurements can take place simultaneously. We consider two experimentally-motivated examples of detecting $^{23}$Na$^{133}$Cs and $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs with $^{133}$Cs atoms. Finally, we discuss several strategies for mitigating various sources of crosstalk.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bell Nonlocality with Extremal Non-Signaling Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal non-signaling (ENS) boxes are correlations that correspond to vertices of the non-signaling polytope of a Bell scenario. Neither quantum theory nor any theory for ideal measurements allows for ENS boxes. That is, according to quantum theory, ENS boxes are nonphysical. Still, ENS boxes are crucial for addressing a number of problems in Bell nonlocality. Here, we obtain ENS boxes in arbitrary bipartite Bell scenarios and present the complete list of ENS boxes for several unexplored scenarios. Equipped with the boxes, we revisit several foundational questions. We find that already two copies of any ENS box violate the exclusivity (or local orthogonality) and Specker's principles. We provide the minimal decomposition of the magic square correlation - the simplest known perfect correlation in nature - in terms of ENS boxes. We identify the minimal scenario in which a dit of communication (with d &lt; 6) is insufficient to simulate ENS boxes. Our results show that the ENS boxes approach leads to new results and opens new avenues for research.</description>

      <title>Plutarch: Toward Scalable Operational Parallelism on Racetrack-Shaped Trapped-Ion Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent advancement in quantum computing shows a quantum advantage of certified randomness on the racetrack processor. This work investigates the execution efficiency of this architecture for general-purpose programs. We first explore the impact of increasing zones on runtime efficiency. Counterintuitively, our evaluations using variational programs reveal that expanding zones may degrade runtime performance under the existing scheduling policy. This degradation may be attributed to the increase in track length, which increases ion circulation overhead, offsetting the benefits of enhanced parallelism. To mitigate this, the proposed \textit{Plutarch} exploits 3 strategies: (i) unitary decomposition and translation to maximize zone utilization, (ii) prioritizing the execution of nearby gates over ion circulation, and (iii) implementing shortcuts to provide the alternative path.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Of A Quantum Magnetometer Chip Based On Proprietary And Scalable 4H-Silicon Carbide Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an industrially scalable, power-efficient and high-performance quantum magnetometer chip based on proprietary 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) technology, leveraging wafer-scale fabrication techniques to optimize V2 silicon vacancy color centers for highly reproducible, industry-grade fabrication with precise control of depth and density. The integration of these color center ensembles into a planar silicon carbide waveguide enables efficient excitation of a large ensemble and simplifies fluorescence extraction compared to standard confocal methods. We report continuous-wave (CW) optically detected magnetic resonance measurements, complemented by Rabi, Ramsey, and Hahn-echo sequences, which demonstrate coherent capabilities of the large embedded ensemble of V2 centers. Based on the data, our device exhibits sensor shot-noise limited sensitivities 2-3 orders of magnitude lower compared to more complex confocal techniques. Collectively, these advancements simplify the quantum sensor architecture, enhance sensitivity, and streamline optical excitation and collection, thereby paving the way for the development of next-generation SiC-quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation of Arbitrary Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to conceal a program's internal structure while preserving its functionality. A central open problem is whether an obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits exists. Despite several efforts having been made toward this goal, prior works have succeeded only in obfuscating quantum circuits that implement either pseudo-deterministic functions or unitary transformations. Although unitary transformations already include a broad class of quantum computation, many important quantum tasks, such as state preparation and quantum error-correction, go beyond unitaries and fall within general completely positive trace-preserving maps.
  In this work, we construct the first quantum ideal obfuscation scheme for arbitrary quantum circuits that support quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model assuming post-quantum one-way functions, thereby resolving an open problem posed in Bartusek et al. (STOC 2023), Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024), and Huang and Tang (FOCS 2025). At the core of our construction lies a novel primitive that we introduce, called the subspace-preserving strong pseudorandom unitary (spsPRU). An spsPRU is a family of efficient unitaries that fix every vector in a given linear subspace $S$, while acting as a Haar random unitary on the orthogonal complement $S^\perp$ under both forward and inverse oracle queries. Furthermore, by instantiating the classical oracle model with the ideal obfuscation scheme for classical circuits proposed by Jain et al. (CRYPTO 2023) and later enhanced by Bartusek et al. (arxiv:2510.05316), our obfuscation scheme can also be realized in the quantumly accessible pseudorandom oracle model.</description>

      <title>Collective inhibition of light scattering from atoms into an optical cavity at a magic frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of a new magic frequency within the hyperfine structure of the D2 line of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms at which the scattering of light into a high-finesse cavity is suppressed by an interplay between quantum interference and the strong collective coupling of atoms to the cavity. Scattering from a cloud of laser-driven cold atoms into the cavity was measured in a polarization sensitive way. We have found that both the Rayleigh and Raman scattering processes into the near-resonant cavity modes are extinguished at 185 MHz below the F=2$\leftrightarrow$F'=3 transition frequency. This coincidence together with the shape of the observed spectral dip imply that the effect relies on a quantum interference in the polariton excitations of the strongly coupled combined atom-photon system. We have also demonstrated the existence of a magic frequency around -506 MHz, where only the Raman scattering is suppressed due to a quantum interference effect at the single-atom level.</description>

      <title>Impact of control signal phase noise on qubit fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As qubit decoherence times are increased and readout technologies are improved, nonidealities in the drive signals, such as phase noise, are going to represent a growing limitation to the fidelity achievable at the end of complex control pulse sequencies. Here we study the impact on fidelity of phase noise affecting reference oscillators with the help of numerical simulations, which allow us to directly take into account the interaction between the phase fluctuations in the control signals and the evolution of the qubit state. Our method is based on the generation of phase noise realizations consistent with a given power spectral density, that are then applied to the pulse carrier in simulations, with Qiskit-Dynamics, of the qubit temporal evolution. By comparing the final state obtained at the end of a noisy pulse sequence with that in the ideal case and averaging over multiple noise realizations, we estimate the resulting degradation in fidelity, and exploiting an approximate analytical representation of a carrier affected by phase fluctuations, we discuss the contributions of the different spectral components of phase noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir interaction in salted water contains a universal contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that makes it of a longer range than previously thought. The universal contribution dominates non universal ones at the distances relevant for actin fibers inside the cell. We discuss universal and non-universal contributions with a model mimicking biological matter. We also show that the universal Casimir effect should have important implications at the cell scale.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic principles of exciton-polariton relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons are light-matter hybrid quasi-particles that have emerged as a flexible platform for developing quantum technologies and engineering material properties. However, the fundamental mechanistic principles that govern their dynamics and relaxation remain elusive. In this work, we provide the microscopic mechanistic understanding of the exciton-polariton relaxation process that follows from an excitation in the upper polariton. Using both mixed quantum-classical simulations and analytical analysis, we reveal that phonon-induced upper-to-lower polariton relaxation proceeds via two steps: the first step is a vertical inter-band transition from the upper to the lower polariton, which is followed by a second step that is a phonon-induced Fr\"ohlich scattering within the lower polariton. We find that in materials of finite thickness (which include filled cavities), phonon-induced polaritonic intraband Fr\"ohlich scattering is significantly suppressed. We show that the microscopic origin of this suppression is phonon-fluctuations synchronization (or self-averaging) due to the polaritonic spatial delocalization in the quantization direction. Finally, we show that the same phonon fluctuation-synchronization effect plays a central role across polaritonic relaxation pathways, and we derive simple analytical expressions that relate a material's finite thickness to the corresponding relaxation rate constants.</description>

      <title>Displacement-Squeeze receiver for BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states surpassing the coherent-states Helstrom bound under imperfect conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a displacement-squeeze receiver (DSR) for discriminating BPSK displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK). The receiver applies a displacement followed by a squeezing operation with the squeezing axis rotated by $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and performs photon-number-resolving detection with a MAP threshold decision. This processing effectively increases the distinguishability of the input states by elongating their distance in phase space and reducing their population overlap in Fock basis. We show that for all signal energy N, $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} \in \left[P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}, 2P_\text{HB}^\text{DSS}\right]$, under equal priors and ideal condition. In the low-energy regime, DSR beats the S-BPSK SQL at $N \approx 0.3$ and drops below the coherent-state BPSK (C-BPSK) Helstrom bound at $N \approx 0.4$, reaching $P_\text{err}^\text{DSR} &lt; 1\%$ near $N \approx 0.6$. Finally, we quantify performance under non-unit efficiency and dark counts, phase diffusion, and receiver thermal noise, with MAP threshold adaptation providing robustness across these nonidealities.</description>

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for identifying non-Markovian dynamical equations of motion for open quantum systems. Starting from the Nakajima--Zwanzig formalism, we vectorize the reduced density matrix into a four-dimensional state vector and cast the dynamics as a Volterra integro-differential equation with an operator-valued memory kernel. The learning task is then formulated as a constrained optimization problem over the admissible operator space, where correlation functions are approximated by rational functions using Pad\'e approximants.

      <title>A saturation-absorption rubidium magnetometer with multilevel optical Bloch-equation modeling for intermediate-to-high fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SASHMAG (Saturated Absorption Spectroscopy High-field MAGnetometer), an atomic sensor designed for precision magnetic-field measurements in the intermediate-to-high field regime ($&gt;0.2\,\text{T}$) using Rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$). The sensor operates in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions decouple, and utilizes counter-propagating pump-probe configuration in Faraday geometry to resolve isolated, Doppler-free Zeeman transitions. To interpret the resulting spectra in this strongly field-dependent regime, we developed a comprehensive multilevel optical Bloch-equation model solved explicitly in the uncoupled $\ket{m_I, m_J}$ basis, capturing state mixing and nonlinear saturation dynamics. This model reproduces measured spectra at sub-Doppler resolution and is consistent with analytical expectations for power broadening and thermal Doppler scaling. Magnetic field estimation is performed using a physics-constrained optimization routine that infers the magnetic field by minimizing the residual between experimentally extracted line centers and calculated transition frequencies from the field-dependent Hamiltonian. We demonstrate magnetic field retrieval from $0.2\,\text{T}$ to $0.4\,\text{T}$ with a precision of $\pm 0.0017 \,\text{T}$). Furthermore, the validated simulation establishes a foundation for generating synthetic training datasets, paving the way for autonomous, Machine Learning-enhanced magnetometry in applications ranging from MRI to fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm for Arbitrary Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, distributed quantum computation has garnered considerable interest, as it overcomes the physical limitations of single-device architectures and enables scalable quantum information processing. In this study, we focus on the challenge of achieving exact amplitude amplification for quantum states with arbitrary amplitude distributions and subsequently propose a Distributed Exact Quantum Amplitude Amplification Algorithm (DEQAAA). Specifically, (1) it supports partitioning across any number of nodes $t$ within the range $2 \leq t \leq n$; (2) the maximum qubit count required for any single node is expressed as $\max \left(n_0,n_1,\dots,n_{t-1} \right) $, where $n_j$ represents the number of qubits at the $j$-th node, with $\sum_{j=0}^{t-1} n_j =n$; (3) it can realize exact amplitude amplification for multiple targets of a quantum state with arbitrary amplitude distributions; (4) we verify the effectiveness of DEQAAA by resolving a specific exact amplitude amplification task involving two targets (8 and 14 in decimal) via MindSpore Quantum, a quantum simulation software, with tests conducted on 4-qubit, 6-qubit, 8-qubit and 10-qubit systems. Notably, through the decomposition of $C^{n-1}PS$ gates, DEQAAA demonstrates remarkable advantages in both quantum gate count and circuit depth as the qubit number scales, thereby boosting its noise resilience. In the 10-qubit scenario, for instance, it achieves a reduction of over $97\%$ in both indicators compared to QAAA and EQAAA, underscoring its outstanding resource-saving performance.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Decoding for Concatenated Quantum Hamming Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate concatenated quantum codes offer a promising pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet designing efficient decoders that fully exploit their error-correction capability remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a hard-decision decoder for concatenated quantum Hamming codes with time complexity polynomial in the block length. This decoder overcomes the limitations of conventional local decoding by leveraging higher-level syndrome information to revise lower-level recovery decisions -- a strategy we refer to as bidirectional decoding. For the concatenated $[[15,7,3]]$ quantum Hamming code under independent bit-flip noise, the bidirectional decoder improves the threshold from approximately $1.56\%$ to $4.35\%$ compared with standard local decoding. Moreover, the decoder empirically preserves the full $3^{L}$ code-distance scaling for at least three levels of concatenation, resulting in substantially faster logical-error suppression than the $2^{L+1}$ scaling offered by local decoders. Our results can enhance the competitiveness of concatenated-code architectures for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Latin squares of order $6m$ with all possible cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$ array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as identical if there exists a real number $\theta$ such that $|u\rangle=e^{i\theta}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array. In this note,we use sub-QLS$(6)$ to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and any $c\in [6m,36m^2]\setminus \{6m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(6m)$ with cardinality $c$.</description>

      <title>Transient fields in oblique scattering from an infinite planar dielectric interface -- a qubit lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An initial value algorithm is utilized to examine the time dependent evolution of the electromagnetic fields arising from oblique scattering of bounded pulses from an infinite planar dielectric interface. Since the qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) is almost fully unitary, one finds excellent conservation of electromagnetic energy. Various Gaussian envelope pulses are considered in regimes where the incident angle is below that needed for total internal reflection. While the reflected pulse retains its overall Gaussian shape, the transmitted pulse exhibits a combination of a Gaussian envelope along with Huygen-like emitted wave fronts from the collision point of the initial pulse with the infinite dielectric interface. The strength of these Huygen wavefronts depends on the width of the incident pulse.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects in Dark-State Laser Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified many-body theory of two-photon dark-state laser cooling, the workhorse for preparing trapped ions close to their motional quantum ground state. For ions with a $\Lambda$ level structure, driven by Raman lasers, we identify an ion-number-dependent crossover between weak and strong coupling where both the cooling rate and final temperature are simultaneously optimized. We obtain simple analytic results in both extremes: In the weak coupling limit, we show a Lorentzian spin-absorption spectrum determines the cooling rate and final occupation of the motional state, which are both independent of the number of ions. We also highlight the benefit of including an additional spin dependent force in this case. In the strong coupling regime, our theory reveals the role of collective dynamics arising from phonon exchange between dark and bright states, allowing us to explain the enhancement of the cooling rate with increasing ion number. Our analytic results agree closely with exact numerical simulations and provide experimentally accessible guidelines for optimizing cooling in large ion crystals, a key step toward scalable, high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ascertaining higher-order quantum correlations in high energy physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality is a peculiar nature of quanta and it stands as an important quantum resource in application. Yet mere linear property of it, viz. the first order in moment, has been explored through various inequalities. Noticing the vast higher-order regime unexplored, in this study we investigate the higher-order quantum correlations in entangled hyperon-antihyperon system, which may be generated massively in charmonium decays. A new type of Clauser-Horne inequality for statistical cumulants and central moments is formulated. We find that a significant violation of the third-order constraint, indicating the existence of higher-order correlation, exists in hyperon-antihyperon system and can be observed in high energy physics experiments, like BESIII and Belle II. Notably, the violation manifests more in higher energy systems of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pair against the kinematic contamination of timelike events.</description>

      <title>Scale Invariance Breaking and Discrete Phase Invariance in Few-Body Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale invariance in quantum mechanics can be broken in several ways. A well-known example is the breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance, whose typical realization is the Efimov effect of three-body problems. Here we discuss yet another discrete symmetry to which continuous scale invariance can be broken: discrete phase invariance. We first revisit the one-body problem on the half line in the presence of an inverse-square potential -- the simplest example of nontrivial scale-invariant quantum mechanics -- and show that continuous scale invariance can be broken to discrete phase invariance in a small window of coupling constant. We also show that discrete phase invariance manifests itself as circularly distributed simple poles on Riemann sheets of the S-matrix. We then present three examples of few-body problems that exhibit discrete phase invariance. These examples are the one-body Aharonov-Bohm problem, a two-body problem of nonidentical particles in two dimensions, and a three-body problem of nonidentical particles in one dimension, all of which contain a codimension-two ``magnetic'' flux in configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Geometric Hybrid Poincar\'e Sphere with Variable Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric hybrid Poincar\'e sphere (GHPS) as a unified geometrical framework for describing structured photon states with independently controllable spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). Unlike the conventional higher-order Poincar\'e sphere, in which the SAM and OAM are intrinsically coupled through fixed basis states, the GHPS is constructed by defining its poles as direct products of arbitrary orthogonal bases on the Poincar\'e sphere (PS) and orbital Poincar\'e sphere (OPS) and by superposing these pole states. Using numerical simulations, we analyze representative GHPS states and show that the GHPS spherical coordinates govern the amplitude ratio and relative phase between the pole bases. This framework enables spatially inhomogeneous polarization distributions and intensity patterns, including nonseparable structures in which polarization and intensity are intrinsically intertwined, and provides a systematic state-space description for the coherent geometrical control of advanced structured light fields.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Certification Framework for Generalized Quantum Arimoto-Blahut Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized quantum Arimoto--Blahut (QAB) algorithm is a powerful derivative-free iterative method in quantum information theory. A key obstacle to its broader use is that existing convergence guarantees typically rely on analytical conditions that are either overly restrictive or difficult to verify for concrete problems. We address this issue by introducing an a posteriori certification viewpoint: instead of requiring fully a priori verifiable assumptions, we provide convergence and error guarantees that can be validated directly from the iterates produced by the algorithm. Specifically, we prove a generalized global convergence theorem showing that, under convexity and a substantially weaker numerically verifiable condition, the QAB iteration converges to the global minimizer. This theorem yields a practical certification procedure: by checking explicit inequalities along the computed trajectory, one can certify global optimality and bound the suboptimality of the obtained value. As an application, we develop a certified iterative scheme for computing the quantum relative entropy of channels, a fundamental measure of distinguishability in quantum dynamics. This quantity is notoriously challenging to evaluate numerically: gradient-based methods are impeded by the complexity of matrix functions such as square roots and logarithms, while recent semidefinite programming approaches can become computationally and memory intensive at high precision. Our method avoids these bottlenecks by combining the QAB iteration with a posteriori certification, yielding an efficient and scalable algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate rapid convergence and improved scalability and adaptivity compared with SDP-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic probability approach to loopholes in CHSH experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the CHSH inequality from an informational, timing-sensitive viewpoint using game-theoretic probability, which avoids assuming an underlying probability space. The locality loophole and the measurement-dependence (``freedom-of-choice'') loophole are reformulated as structural constraints in a sequential hidden-variable game between Scientists and Nature. We construct a loopholes-closed game with capital processes that test (i) convergence of empirical conditional frequencies to the CHSH correlations and (ii) the absence of systematic correlations between measurement settings and Nature's hidden-variable assignments, and prove that Nature cannot satisfy both simultaneously: at least one capital process must diverge. This yields an operational winning strategy for Scientists and a game-theoretic probabilistic interpretation of experimentally observed CHSH violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis explains thermalization in isolated quantum systems through the statistical properties of observables in the energy eigenbasis. We investigate the crossover from integrability to chaos in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, establishing a direct correspondence between the spectral correlations of the Hamiltonian and local observables expressed in the energy eigenbasis as a signature of ergodicity breaking. By introducing a local perturbation that drives the system from integrability to chaos, we track the standard ETH indicators and the eigenstate entanglement entropy. We introduce a submatrix-based framework for analyzing local observables in the energy eigenbasis. By extracting real-symmetric blocks along the diagonal of the local observables represented in eigenbasis, we show that these submatrices exhibit both the short-range and long-range spectral features of the Hamiltonian. Remarkably, this correspondence persists even in a partially ergodic regime, indicating that the emergence of chaos is already encoded locally within the observables' matrix structure and that small blocks are sufficient to capture the underlying spectral correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy enables detailed investigations of vibronic effects in molecular and solid-state systems. We present explicit analytical expressions for multidimensional nonlinear response functions in the presence of Herzberg-Teller (non-Condon) coupling, within the displaced harmonic oscillator model. The formulation applies to electronic systems with an arbitrary number N of electronic states and to response functions of arbitrary order M in the light-matter interaction. We show that Herzberg-Teller coupling introduces additional oscillatory factors in the time-domain response functions, leading, upon Fourier transformation, to replicas of the Franck-Condon multidimensional spectra shifted by integer multiples of the vibrational frequencies. The present results provide a general analytical framework for the interpretation of non-Condon effects in coherent multidimensional spectroscopies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key considerations in the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) protocols is the encoding of classical data onto a quantum device. In this chapter we introduce the Matrix Product State representation of quantum systems and show how it may be used to construct circuits which encode a desired state. Putting this in the context of QML we show how this process may be modified to give a low depth approximate encoding and crucially that this encoding does not hinder classification accuracy and is indeed exhibits an increased robustness against classical adversarial attacks. This is illustrated by demonstrations of adversarially robust variational quantum classifiers for the MNIST and FMNIST dataset, as well as a small-scale experimental demonstration on a superconducting quantum device.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Quantum Computing: an efficient design framework for many-small-node distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, a large number of physical qubits are required to construct a single logical qubit, and a single quantum node may be able to hold only a small number of logical qubits. In such a case, the idea of distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (DFTQC) is important to demonstrate large-scale quantum computation using small-scale nodes. However, the design of distributed systems on small-scale nodes, where each node can store only one or a few logical qubits for computation, has not been explored well yet. In this paper, we propose network-based quantum computation (NBQC) to efficiently realize distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation using many small-scale nodes. A key idea of NBQC is to let computational data continuously move throughout the network while maintaining the connectivity to other nodes. We numerically show that, for practical benchmark tasks, our method achieves shorter execution times than circuit-based strategies and more node-efficient constructions than measurement-based quantum computing. Also, if we are allowed to specialize the network to the structure of quantum programs, such as peak access frequencies, the number of nodes can be significantly reduced. Thus, our methods provide a foundation in designing DFTQC architecture exploiting the redundancy of many small fault-tolerant nodes.</description>

      <title>Sparse quantum state preparation with improved Toffoli cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum states is one of the most fundamental tasks in quantum computing, and a key primitive in many quantum algorithms. Of particular interest to areas such as quantum simulation and linear-system solvers are sparse quantum states, which contain only a small number $s$ of non-zero computational basis states compared to a generic state. In this work, we present an approach that prepares $s$-sparse states on $n$ qubits, reducing the number of Toffoli gates required compared to prior art. We work in the established framework of first preparing a dense state on a $\lceil{\log(s)}\rceil$-qubit sub-register, and then mapping this state to the target state via an isometry, with the latter step dominating the cost of the full algorithm. The speed-up is achieved by designing an efficient algorithm for finding and implementing the isometry. The worst-case Toffoli cost of our isometry circuit, which may be viewed as a batched version of an approach by Malvetti et al., is essentially $2s$ for sufficiently large values of $n$, yielding roughly a $\log(s)/2$ improvement factor over the state-of-the-art. In numerical benchmarks on randomly chosen states, the cost is closer to $s$. With the improved isometry circuit, we examine the dense-state preparation step and present ways to optimize the joint cost of both steps, particularly in the case of target states with purely real coefficients, by outsourcing some sub-tasks from the dense-state preparation to the isometry.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the No-Go Theorem Yields a Rich Dissipative Phase Diagram in the Open Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model is studied in this work, with the explicit $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term incorporated as required by the Thomas-Reich-Kuhn sum rule. It is shown that anisotropy provides a generic and robust mechanism for overcoming the no-go theorem in dissipative quantum systems, thereby establishing a genuine platform for observing dissipative phase transitions. The inclusion of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term yields a significantly richer and asymmetric steady-state phase diagram, consisting of normal, superradiant, and bistable phases that intersect at tricritical points, while isolated bistable phases also emerge and the number of tricritical points is reduced. Notably, it is near the intersection of the two critical-line branches enclosing the superradiant phases, rather than at the tricritical points, that the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term fundamentally alters the scaling of photon-number fluctuations. Given the inherent role of the $\mathbf{A}^{2}$ term in light-matter interactions, our findings open a realistic route toward the experimental investigation and dynamical control of nonequilibrium critical phenomena in practical open quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>A measurement-based protocol for the generation of delocalised quantum states of a mechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian mechanical states are a key resource for quantum-enhanced sensing and tests of macroscopic quantum physics. We propose a measurement-based protocol to herald delocalized, nonclassical states of a mechanical oscillator in cavity optomechanics by conditioning on Geiger photodetection of the optical output. We analyse under which conditions Stokes-induced optomechanical entanglement give rise to mechanical Wigner Function negativity upon detection. We develop and compare a blue-detuned pulsed scheme and a continuous-wave steady-state scheme employing temporal-mode filtering, and we quantify heralding rates and robustness to finite temperature under realistic detection efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Toward Spectral Engineering of Squeezed Light in High-Gain PDC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the spectral properties of squeezed light generated via parametric down-conversion in the high-gain regime, considering both unapodized and apodized dispersion-engineered waveguides. The gain-dependent evolution of these states is examined starting from the low-gain regime, which includes both highly correlated and nearly uncorrelated cases. For the unapodized configuration, we observe a monotonic increase in spectral purity with gain, whereas the apodized configuration exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, initially decreasing and then recovering at higher gain. By combining Schmidt-mode analysis with a group-velocity-based interpretation, we explain why different dispersion conditions exhibit distinct gain-dependent behavior, specifically that rapid purification occurs when the pump group velocity lies between those of the signal and idler. Our study shows that the evolution of spectral purity is governed primarily by the underlying dispersion of the waveguide. These results demonstrate that dispersion engineering and parametric gain can be jointly exploited to tailor the spectral-mode structure of squeezed-light sources, enabling their optimization for a broad range of quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-Engineered Refrigeration of a Superconducting Cavity with Double-Quantum-Dot Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytically tractable theory of reservoir-engineered refrigeration of a superconducting microwave cavity and map it onto a realistic solid-state implementation based on gate-defined double-quantum-dot (DQD) spin qubits. Treating the DQD not as a spectroscopic element but as a tunable engineered reservoir, we show how gate control of populations, coherences, linewidths, and detuning defines an effective photon birth-death process with predictable detailed balance. This framework yields closed-form expressions for the cavity steady state, identifies cooling bounds and detuning-dependent refrigeration valleys, and clarifies when refrigeration can drive the cavity below both the bath temperature and the DQD setpoint. By distinguishing refreshed (collision-like) and persistent reservoir regimes, we show how memory effects, saturation, and dark-state formation constrain cooling in realistic devices, while collective bright-mode coupling in a two-dot configuration can enhance refrigeration subject to mismatch and dephasing, as confirmed by numerical Lindblad simulations demonstrating targeted millikelvin cavity cooling relevant for cryogenic circuit-QED architectures.</description>

      <title>Geometry- and Topology-Informed Quantum Computing: From States to Real-Time Control with FPGA Prototypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book gives a geometry-first, hardware-aware route through quantum-information workflows, with one goal: connect states, circuits, and measurement to deterministic classical pipelines that make hybrid quantum systems run. Part 1 develops the backbone (essential linear algebra, the Bloch-sphere viewpoint, differential-geometric intuition, and quantum Fisher information geometry) so evolution can be read as motion on curved spaces and measurement as statistics. Part 2 reframes circuits as dataflow graphs: measurement outcomes are parsed, aggregated, and reduced to small linear-algebra updates that schedule the next pulses, highlighting why low-latency, low-jitter streaming matters. Part 3 treats multi-qubit structure and entanglement as geometry and computation, including teleportation, superdense coding, entanglement detection, and Shor's algorithm via quantum phase estimation. Part 4 focuses on topological error correction and real-time decoding (Track A): stabilizer codes, surface-code decoding as "topology -&gt; graph -&gt; algorithm", and Union-Find decoders down to microarchitectural/RTL constraints, with verification, fault injection, and host/control-stack integration under product metrics (bounded latency, p99 tails, fail-closed policies, observability). Optional Track C covers quantum cryptography and streaming post-processing (BB84/E91, QBER/abort rules, privacy amplification, and zero-knowledge/post-quantum themes), emphasizing FSMs, counters, and hash pipelines. Appendices provide visualization-driven iCEstick labs (switch-to-bit conditioning, fixed-point phase arithmetic, FSM sequencing, minimal control ISAs), bridging principles to implementable systems.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite Rains entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the genuine multipartite Rains entanglement (GMRE) as a measure of genuine multipartite entanglement that can be computed using semi-definite programming. Similar to the Rains relative entropy (its bipartite counterpart), the GMRE is monotone under selective quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of the partial transpose, implying that it is a multipartite entanglement monotone. As a consequence, we show that the GMRE bounds both the one-shot standard and probabilistic approximate GHZ-distillable entanglement from above. We also develop a generalization of this quantity that incorporates other entropies, including quantum Renyi relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Dissipative State Engineering of Complex Entanglement with Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward a unique pure steady state corresponding to the desired cluster state. This is done by removing the contribution of the orthogonal states. By explicitly constructing the Liouvillian superoperator in the full $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, we compute the steady-state density matrix, the Liouvillian spectral gap, entanglement witness and the fidelity with respect to the ideal cluster state. The results demonstrate that the cluster state emerges as the steady state when the engineered Liouvillian dissipation dominates over the local Ising interaction between spins. Moreover, we find that the fidelity and Liouvillian spectral gap is relatively insensitive to the system size once the saturation dissipation has been achieved that scales linearly with the qubit number. This analysis illustrates a physically realizable path towards steady-state entanglement generation in the spin systems using engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>A perturbative non-Markovian treatment to low-temperature spin decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular spins are promising candidates for quantum information science, leveraging coherent electronic spin states for quantum sensing and computation. However, the practical application of these systems is hindered by electronic spin decoherence, driven by interactions with nuclear spins in the molecule and the surrounding environment at low temperatures. Predicting dephasing dynamics remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the spin bath. In this work, we develop a non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation to treat an electronic spin coupled to a nuclear-spin bath. By relating ab initio electronic structure parameters directly to the decoherence dynamics, we provide a framework that accounts for pure dephasing in the low-temperature limit. We apply this method to a series of molecular qubit candidates and demonstrate good agreement with experimental relaxation trends. This approach offers a computationally efficient path for the prediction of low-temperature decoherence trends in molecular spin systems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Large Coherent-State Superpositions in Free-Space Optical Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of non-Gaussian quantum states is a key requirement for universal continuous-variable quantum information processing. We report the experimental generation of large-amplitude squeezed coherent-state superpositions (squeezed cat states) on free-space optical pulses, reaching an amplitude of $\alpha = 2.47$, which, to our knowledge, exceeds all previously reported values. Our protocol relies on the controlled mixing of the Fock states $|1\rangle$ and $|2\rangle$ through a tunable beam splitter, followed by heralding via homodyne detection. The resulting state displays three well-resolved negative regions in its Wigner function and achieves a fidelity of $0.53$ with the target state $\propto \hat{S}(z)(|\alpha\rangle - |-\alpha\rangle)$, with $\alpha = 2.47$ and squeezing parameter $z = 0.56$. These results constitute a significant milestone for temporal breeding protocols and for the iterative generation of optical GKP states, opening new perspectives for scalable and fault-tolerant photonic quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We show that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also show that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel, answering a question of Daws.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot and Few-Shot Decoding via Stabilizer Redundancy in Bivariate Bicycle Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle (BB) codes are a prominent class of quantum LDPC codes constructed from group algebras. While the logical dimension and quantum distance of \emph{coprime} BB codes are known to be determined by a greatest common divisor polynomial $g(z)$, the properties governing their fault tolerance under noisy measurement have remained implicit. In this work, we prove that this same polynomial $g(z)$ dictates the code's stabilizer redundancy and the structure of the classical \emph{syndrome codes} required for single-shot decoding. We derive a strict equality between the quantum rate and the stabilizer redundancy density, and we provide BCH-like bounds on the achievable single-shot measurement error tolerance. Guided by this framework, we construct small coprime BB codes with significantly improved syndrome distance ($d_S$) and evaluate them using BP+OSD. Our analysis reveals a structural bottleneck: within the coprime BB ansatz, high quantum rate imposes an upper bound on syndrome distance, limiting single-shot performance. These results provide concrete algebraic design rules for next-generation 2BGA codes in measurement-limited architectures.</description>

      <title>Bias-Aware BP Decoding of Quantum Codes via Directional Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study directionally informed belief propagation (BP) decoding for quantum CSS codes, where anisotropic Tanner-graph structure and biased noise concentrate degeneracy along preferred directions. We formalize this by placing orientation weights on Tanner-graph edges, aggregating them into per-qubit directional weights, and defining a \emph{directional degeneracy enumerator} that summarizes how degeneracy concentrates along those directions. A single bias parameter~$\beta$ maps these weights into site-dependent log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), yielding anisotropic priors that plug directly into standard BP$\rightarrow$OSD decoders without changing the code construction. We derive bounds relating directional and Hamming distances, upper bound the number of degenerate error classes per syndrome as a function of distance, rate, and directional bias, and give a MacWilliams-type expression for the directional enumerator. Finite-length simulations under code-capacity noise show significant logical error-rate reductions -- often an order of magnitude at moderate physical error rates -- confirming that modest anisotropy is a simple and effective route to hardware-aware decoding gains.</description>

      <title>Observation of Unidirectional s-p Orbital Topological Edge States in Driven Photonic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-periodic modulation of a static system is a powerful method for realizing robust unidirectional topological states. So far, all such realizations have been based on interactions among $s$ orbitals, without incorporating inter-orbital couplings. Here, we demonstrate higher-orbital Floquet topological insulators by introducing periodically modulated couplings between the optical $s$ and $p$ orbitals in a square lattice. The staggered phase of the $s$-$p$ couplings gives rise to a synthetic uniform $\pi$ magnetic flux per plaquette of the lattice, and periodic driving of the couplings opens a topological bandgap, characterized by the Floquet winding number. We image topological edge modes of $s$-$p$ orbitals traveling unidirectionally around a corner. Here, the topological phases are realized by a combined effect of the periodic driving and synthetic magnetic flux. Consequently, when the synthetic flux is turned off, the system becomes trivial over a range of driving parameters. Our results open a promising pathway for exploring topological phenomena by introducing the orbital degree of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators provide a powerful platform for realizing strongly correlated phases, enabling access to dynamical signatures of quasiparticles and symmetry breaking processes. Motivated by recent observations of quantum phases in flux-frustrated ladders with non-vanishing ground state currents, we investigate interacting bosons on the dimerized BBH lattice in two dimensions-originally introduced in the context of higher-order topology. After mapping out the phase diagram, which includes vortex superfluid (V-SF), vortex Mott insulator (V-MI), and featureless Mott insulator (MI) phases, we focus on the integer filling case. There, the MI/V-SF transition simultaneously breaks the $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ and U(1) symmetries, where $\mathbb Z_2^{T}$ corresponds to time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Using a slave-boson description, we resolve the excitation spectrum across the transition and uncover a chiral Higgs mode whose mass softens at criticality, providing a dynamical hallmark of emergent chirality that we numerically probe via quench dynamics. Our results establish an experimentally realistic setting for probing unconventional TRS-broken phases and quasiparticles with intrinsic chirality in strongly interacting quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Relationship Between Strain and Bandgap in Thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous analysis that combines theory, simulation, and experimental measurements to quantify the relationship between strain and bandgap in two dimensional gallium selenide (Ga$_2$Se$_2$). Experimentally, we transfer thin Ga$_2$Se$_2$ flakes onto patterned substrates to deterministically induce multiaxial localized strain. We quantify the local strain using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements and COMSOL Multiphysics simulation. We then experimentally map the strain-induced bandgap shifts using high-resolution hyperspectral PL imaging to generate a robust and statistically significant dataset. We systematically fit this data to extract gauge factors that relate the bandgap shift to the local uniaxial and biaxial strain. We then compute the uniaxial and biaxial strain gauge factors via density functional theory (DFT) and find excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined values. Finally, we show that a simple model that computes bandgap shifts from the local uniaxial and biaxial strain predicts the observed multiaxial bandgap shift with less than 10\% error. The combined results provide a framework for deterministic realization of tailored bandgap profiles induced by controlled strain applied to Ga$_2$Se$_2$, with implications for the future realization of localized quantum emitters for quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Process During Complex Time Evolution In Two-Dimensional Integrable and Chaotic CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the complex time evolution of a vacuum state with the insertion of a local primary operator in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs). This complex time evolution can be considered as a composite process constructed from Lorentzian time evolution and a Euclidean evolution induced by a post-selected measurement. Our main finding is that in the spatially-compact system, this complex time evolution drives the state of the subsystems to those of the primary state with the same conformal dimensions of the inserted operator. Contrary to the compact system, the subsystems of the spatially non-compact system evolve to states that depend on the non-unitary process during a certain time regime. In holographic systems with a compact spatial direction, this process induced by a heavy local operator can correspond to the relaxation from a black hole with an inhomogeneous horizon to that with a uniform one, while in the ones with a non-compact spatial direction, it can correspond to the relaxation to that with a horizon depending on the non-unitary process.</description>

      <title>Stationary perturbation theory without sums over intermediate states: Supersymmetric Expansion Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we show that results of Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory can be easily obtained using the recently proposed supersymmetric expansion algorithm. Our formalism avoids the sums over intermediate states and yield directly corrections to the energy and eigenstates in terms of integrals weighted by the probability densities for the edge states of the involved supersymmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible circuit complexity from fusion operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern understanding of symmetry in quantum field theory includes both invertible and non-invertible operations. Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive, trace-preserving quantum channels. Including such gates makes the sector-changing optimisation problem discrete: it reduces to a weighted shortest-path problem on the fusion graph. Circuit complexity therefore combines continuous geometry within sectors with discrete sector jumps. We illustrate the framework in rational conformal field theories and briefly comment on an AdS$_3$ interpretation in which fusion-induced transitions correspond to geometry-changing boundary operations. A companion paper provides full derivations and extended examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs at a lepton collider with polarised beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of heavy-fermion pairs, such as $t\bar t$ or $\tau^+\tau^-$, produced in lepton-lepton collisions with polarised beams. Focusing on spin correlations, entanglement, Bell-inequality violation, and quantum-information--theoretic measures such as purity and magic, we analyse how beam polarisation shapes the structure of the spin-density matrix. We derive analytic expressions for a wide range of helicity configurations, including both Standard Model contributions and generic new-physics effects parametrised by scalar, vector, and tensor four-fermion operators within an effective field theory framework. We show that beam polarisation unlocks a substantially richer set of spin configurations and significantly enhances sensitivity to non-standard interactions. As a phenomenological application, we study $t\bar t$ production at a future linear collider and demonstrate that quantum observables provide a comprehensive and complementary probe of top-quark interactions and stronger constraints on the scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to determine unambiguously the Berry phase solely from quantum oscillations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry phase, a fundamental geometric phase in quantum systems, has become a crucial tool for probing the topological properties of materials. Quantum oscillations, such as Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, are widely used to extract this phase, but its unambiguous determination remains challenging. This work highlights the inherent ambiguities in interpreting the oscillation phase solely from SdH data, primarily due to the influence of the spin factor $R_S$, which depends on the Land\'e $g$-factor and effective mass. While the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) theory provides a framework for analyzing oscillations, the unknown g-factor introduces significant uncertainty. For instance, a zero oscillation phase could arise either from a nontrivial Berry phase or a negative $R_S$. We demonstrate that neglecting $R_S$ in modern studies, especially for topological materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, can lead to doubtful conclusions. Through theoretical analysis and numerical examples, we show how the interplay between the Berry phase and Zeeman effect complicates phase determination. Additionally, we also discuss another underappreciated mechanism - the magnetic field dependence of the Fermi level. Our discussion underscores the need for complementary experimental techniques to resolve these ambiguities and calls for further research to refine the interpretation of quantum oscillations in topological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a recently developed "tangent fermion" method to discretize the Hamiltonian of a helical Luttinger liquid on a one-dimensional lattice, including two-particle backscattering processes that may open a gap in the spectrum. The fermion-doubling obstruction of the sine dispersion is avoided by working with a tangent dispersion, preserving the time-reversal symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The numerical results from a tensor network calculation on a finite lattice confirm the expectation from infinite-system analytics, that a gapped phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry emerges when the Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point and the Luttinger parameter crosses a critical value.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spectroscopy of $^{173}$Yb$^{+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to other stable isotopes of $\rm{Yb}^+$, $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ has a richer hyperfine structure, which leads to more favorable clock transitions, spectroscopic techniques for probing new physics, and more sophisticated quantum computing architectures. However, to date, its electronic spectrum remains poorly characterized. Here, we report on efficient laser cooling, state preparation, and detection of a single trapped $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ ion. The previously unobserved $^2\!S_{1/2} \rightarrow {}^2\!D_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 436 nm is coherently excited, and the isotope shift between $^{171}\rm{Yb}^+$ and $^{173}\rm{Yb}^+$ on this transition is determined with an uncertainty of 1.4 Hz. Using microwave spectroscopy, we resolve the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ state with a relative uncertainty below $10^{-8}$. From the HFS measurement data, we infer for ${}^{173}$Yb a nuclear magnetic octupole moment $\Omega = -0.062(8)\,({\rm b} \times \mu_N)$ with uncertainty reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to previous studies. The data also allow us to determine hyperfine anomalies for the ${}^2\!S_{1/2}$ and ${}^2\!D_{3/2}$ states.</description>

Abstract: We explore the existence and stability of exceptional points (EPs) in finite waveguide arrays subject to single-site dissipation. We show that the EP landscape is dictated by a geometry-dependent parity effect, leading to strictly distinct spectral behaviors for arrays with even versus odd numbers of waveguides. Through analytical derivation and numerical analysis, we define the conditions under which these singularities emerge and evolve. Our findings clarify the mechanisms of symmetry breaking in finite non-Hermitian lattices, offering new guidelines for the design of robust optical structures that exploit or avoid exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon-Membrane TES Microcalorimeters for Large-Format X-ray Spectrometers with Integrated Microwave SQUID Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.
  This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the inverse Faraday and the inverse Cotton--Mouton effects arising from quantum geometry, characterized by the quantum metric quadrupole and the weighted quantum metric. Within a semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we establish a general formalism describing light-induced magnetization in electronic systems as a second-order response to the electric field of light. Using continuum and tight-binding models, we discuss the symmetry constraints on these effects and estimate the magnitudes of the resulting magnetizations. Our results highlight a direct manifestation of quantum-geometric quantities in nonlinear magneto-optical responses and suggest a viable pathway for experimental detection.</description>

Abstract: There is a tremendous interest in fabricating superconducting flux circuits that are nonstoquastic -- i.e., have positive off-diagonal matrix elements -- in their qubit representation, as these circuits are thought to be unsimulable by classical approaches due to the presence of a sign problem and thus could play a key role in the demonstration of speedups in quantum annealing protocols. We show, however, that the elimination of the sign problem in these systems is possible by the direct simulation of the flux circuits. Our approach not only obviates the reduction of flux circuits to their qubit representation but also produces results that are more in the spirit of the experimental setup. We discuss the implications of our work, arguing that our findings cast doubt on the conception that superconducting flux circuits represent the correct avenue for universal adiabatic quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformations of transformations, also called higher-order transformations, is a natural concept in information processing, which has recently attracted significant interest in the study of quantum causal relations. In this work, a framework for characterizing higher-order quantum transformations which relies on the use of superoperator projectors is presented. More precisely, working with projectors in the Choi-Jamiolkowski picture is shown to provide a handy way of defining the characterization constraints on any class of higher-order transformations. The algebraic properties of these projectors are furthermore shown to obey rules similar to multiplicative additive linear logic (MALL), providing an intuitive way of comparing any two classes through their projectors. The main novelty of this work is the introduction to the algebra of the 'prec' connector. It is used for the characterization of maps that are no signaling from input to output or the other way around. This allows to assess the possible signaling structure of any transformation characterized within the projective framework. The properties of the prec are moreover shown to yield a normal form for projective expressions. This hints towards a general way to compare different classes of higher-order transformations.</description>

      <title>Classical combinations of quantum states for solving banded circulant linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving linear systems is of great importance in numerous fields. Proposed quantum algorithms for preparing solutions for linear systems include the HHL algorithm with subsequent refinements and variational methods. Circulant linear systems appear in many physics-related differential equations. An interesting case is banded circulant linear systems whose non-zero terms are within distance K of the main diagonal. For these systems, we propose an approach based on the classical combination of quantum states (CQS) method relying on convex optimization against the available analytical solution. From decompositions into cyclic permutations, the solution can be approximately represented by a classical combination of a polynomial number of quantum states. We validate our methods using classical simulations as well as execution on an IBM quantum computer. While in the setting of this paper, efficient classical algorithms are available, our results demonstrate the potential applicability of the CQS method for solving physics problems such as heat transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms typically demand prohibitively complicated circuits to solve practical problems. Previous studies have shown that classical randomness can accelerate some specific quantum algorithms. In this work, we introduce the Randomized Truncated Series (RTS) which extends this acceleration to all quantum algorithms that rely on truncated series approximations. RTS offers two key advantages: it quadratically suppresses truncation errors and allows for continuous adjustment of the effective truncation order. By leveraging random mixing between two quantum circuits, RTS ensures that their probabilistic combination accurately realizes the desired algorithm, while significantly reducing the average circuit size. We demonstrate the versatility of RTS through concrete applications. Our results shed light on the path toward practical quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

      <title>Q-CHOP: Quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems that arise in science and industry typically have constraints. Yet the presence of constraints makes them challenging to tackle using both classical and quantum optimization algorithms. We propose a new quantum algorithm for constrained optimization, which we call quantum constrained Hamiltonian optimization (Q-CHOP). Our algorithm leverages the observation that for many problems, while the best solution is difficult to find, the worst feasible (constraint-satisfying) solution is known. The basic idea of Q-CHOP is to enforce a Hamiltonian constraint at all times, thereby restricting evolution to the subspace of feasible states, and slowly ``rotate'' an objective Hamiltonian to trace an adiabatic path from the worst feasible state to the best feasible state. Q-CHOP thereby assigns qualitatively distinct roles to the constraint and objective functions of a constrained optimization problem. We additionally propose a version of Q-CHOP that can start in any feasible state. Finally, we benchmark Q-CHOP against the commonly-used adiabatic algorithm of quantum annealing with an objective function that penalizes constraint violation, and find that Q-CHOP consistently performs significantly better on a wide range of problems, including textbook graph problems, knapsack problems, combinatorial auctions, and a real-world financial use case of bond exchange-traded fund basket optimization.</description>

      <title>Solving Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems in the Wool Textile Industry with Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many modern manufacturing companies have evolved from a single production facility to a multi-factory production environment that must manage both regionally dispersed production orders and their multi-site production steps. The availability of a range of machines in different locations capable of performing the same operation and shipping times between factories have transformed planning systems from the classic Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) to the Distributed Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP). Consequently, the complexity of production planning has increased significantly. We employ Quantum Annealing (QA) to solve the DFJSP in our research. In addition to assigning production orders to production sites, production steps are also assigned to these sites. This requirement is based on a real use case of a wool textile manufacturing company. To investigate the applicability of this method to large problem instances, problems ranging from 50 variables up to 250 variables, the largest problem that could be embedded into a D-Wave quantum annealer Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), are formulated and solved. Special Attention is dedicated to determining the Lagrange parameters of the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and the QPU configuration parameters, as these factors can significantly impact solution quality. The obtained solutions are compared to solutions obtained by Simulated Annealing (SA), both in terms of solution quality and calculation time. The results demonstrate that QA has the potential to solve large problem instances specific to the industry.</description>

      <title>The Qudit ZH Calculus for Arbitrary Finite Fields: Universality and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the graphical ZH calculus to qudits of prime-power dimensions $q = p^t$, implementing field arithmetic in arbitrary finite fields. This is an extension of a previous result by Roy which implemented arithmetic of prime-sized fields; and an alternative to a result by de Beaudrap which extended the ZH to implement cyclic ring arithmetic in $\mathbb Z / q\mathbb Z$ rather than field arithmetic in $\mathbb F_q$. We show this generalized ZH calculus to be universal over matrices $\mathbb C^{q^n} \to \mathbb C^{q^m}$ with entries in the ring $\mathbb Z[\omega]$ where $\omega$ is a $p$th root of unity. As an illustration of the necessity of such an extension of ZH for field rather than cyclic ring arithmetic, we offer a graphical description and proof for a quantum algorithm for polynomial interpolation. This algorithm relies on the invertibility of multiplication, and therefore can only be described in a graphical language that implements field, rather than ring, multiplication.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting and photonic technologies are envisioned to play a key role in the Quantum Internet. However the hybridization of these technologies requires functional quantum transducers for converting superconducting qubits, exploited in quantum computation, into ``flying'' qubits, able to propagate through the network (and vice-versa). In this paper, quantum transduction is theoretically investigated for a key functionality of the Quantum Internet, namely, multipartite entanglement distribution. Different communication models for quantum transduction are provided, in order to make the entanglement distribution possible. The proposed models departs from the large heterogeneity of hardware solutions available in literature, abstracting from the particulars of the specific solutions with a communication engineering perspective. Then, a performance analysis of the proposed models is conducted through key communication metrics, such as quantum capacity and entanglement generation probability. The analysis reveals that -- although the considered communication metrics depend on transduction hardware parameters for all the proposed models -- the particulars of the considered transduction paradigm play a relevant role in the overall entanglement distribution performance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum error correction protocols with erasure qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Erasure qubits offer a promising avenue toward reducing the overhead of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. However, they require additional operations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase runtime of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we focus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In particular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable regions in the phase space of error parameters and probe the subthreshold scaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure qubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We use the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the performance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure qubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the absence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light can be squeezed by reducing the quantum uncertainty of the electric field for some phases. We show how to use this purely quantum effect to extract net mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine. Along the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum systems does not capture the extractable mechanical work, as it does not reflect the energy leaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an Otto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the absence of a thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from squeezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial squeezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal, demonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.</description>

      <title>How Are Quantum Eigenfunctions of Hydrogen Atom Related To Its Classical Elliptic Orbits?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a highly-excited energy eigenfunction $\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})$ of hydrogen atom can be approximated as an equal-weight superposition of classical elliptic orbits with energy $E_n$ and angular momentum $L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar$, and $z$ component of angular momentum $L_z=m\hbar$. This correspondence is established by comparing the quantum probability distribution $|\psi_{nlm}(\vec{r})|^2$ and the classical probability distribution $p_c(\vec{r})$ of an ensemble of such orbits. This finding illustrates a general principle: in the semi-classical limit, an energy eigenstate of a quantum system is in general reduced to a collection of classical orbits, rather than a single classical orbit.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Quantum Machine Learning Architectures for Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As financial fraud becomes increasingly complex, effective detection methods are essential. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) introduces certain capabilities that may enhance both accuracy and efficiency in this area. This study examines how different quantum feature maps and ansatz configurations affect the performance of three QML-based classifiers, the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), the Sampler Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), and the Estimator Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), when applied to two non-normalized financial fraud datasets. Different quantum feature map and ansatz configurations are evaluated, revealing distinct performance patterns. The VQC consistently demonstrates strong classification results, achieving an F1-score of 0.88, while the SQNN also delivers promising outcomes. In contrast, the EQNN struggles to produce robust results, emphasizing the challenges presented by non-standardized data. Statistical validation using ANOVA confirms the significance of observed performance differences. Additionally, robustness tests on the best-performing models under five quantum noise types show that they maintain competitive performance, supporting their practical applicability. These findings highlight the importance of careful model configuration in QML-based financial fraud detection. By showing how specific feature maps and ansatz choices influence predictive success, this work guides researchers and practitioners in refining QML approaches for complex financial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interplay between quantum interference and classical randomness can enhance performance of various quantum information tasks. In the present paper we analyze recurrence phenomena in the discrete-time quantum stochastic walk on a line, which is a quantum stochastic process that interpolates between quantum and classical walk dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that introducing classical randomness can reduce the recurrence probability -- despite the fact that the classical random walk returns with certainty -- and we identify the conditions under which this intriguing phenomenon occurs. Numerical evaluation of the first-return generating function allows us to investigate the asymptotics of the return probability as the step number approaches infinity. This provides strong evidence that the suppression of recurrence probability is not a transient effect but a robust feature of the underlying quantum-classical interplay in the asymptotic limit. Our results show that for certain tasks discrete-time quantum stochastic walks outperform both classical random walks and unitary quantum walks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Upper Limit of Backflash Attack in Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information-theoretic security grounded in the fundamental laws of physics. Nevertheless, practical imperfections can introduce side channels that expose QKD systems to quantum hacking, especially passive attacks that are inherently difficult to detect. In this study, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the upper limit of the backflash attack-a representative passive side-channel threat. Using a fully equipped fiber-based QKD receiver, we demonstrate the feasibility of the attack and reveal its limited capability in distinguishing quantum states. We further develop a theoretical framework to quantify the maximum distinguishability achievable by an eavesdropper, taking into account the broadband spectral nature of backflash photons. The analysis shows that Eve can extract effective key information from at most 95.7% of the backflash photons. Based on these findings, we evaluate the secure key rate of a decoy-state BB84 QKD system under backflash attack. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of QKD systems to backflash emissions and offer a general methodology to evaluate the practical security of QKD systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Quantum Feature Extraction (QuFeX), a novel quantum machine learning module. The proposed module enables feature extraction in a reduced-dimensional space, significantly decreasing the number of parallel evaluations required in typical quantum convolutional neural network architectures. Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system's evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Magic State Distillation under Imperfect Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic state distillation (MSD) is the leading approach to generate the non-Clifford resources required for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation. While most analyses assume ideal measurements in the distillation process, this assumption breaks down on near-term hardware where measurement fidelity remains limited and large quantum error-correcting codes are unavailable. Here we establish a general framework to analyze MSD under imperfect measurements, and reveal a sharp threshold phenomenon that differs from previous known threshold on input state error: Below a critical measurement strength, MSD loses its distillation power entirely, whereas above the threshold, the \textit{target states} are at most first-order biased and the \textit{distillation efficiency} is reduced to linear, leading to exponentially higher distillation overheads. To mitigate this fragility, we present a universal method to maximize MSD robustness against imperfect measurements by choosing stabilizer generators in standard form, which applies to all known protocols without incurring additional costs. Our work reveal fundamental constraints on MSD protocols with measurement noise and provide insights for designing practically robust distillation protocols in the near-term era of quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Offset Charge Dependence of Measurement-Induced Transitions in Transmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in achieving scalable fault tolerance in superconducting quantum processors is readout fidelity, which lags behind one- and two-qubit gate fidelity. A major limitation in improving qubit readout is measurement-induced transitions, also referred to as qubit ionization, caused by multiphoton qubit-resonator excitation occurring at specific photon numbers. Since ionization can involve highly excited states, it has been predicted that in transmons -- the most widely used superconducting qubit -- the photon number at which measurement-induced transitions occur is gate charge dependent. This dependence is expected to persist deep in the transmon regime where the qubit frequency is gate charge insensitive. We experimentally confirm this prediction by characterizing measurement-induced transitions with increasing resonator photon population while actively stabilizing the transmon's gate charge. Furthermore, because highly excited states are involved, achieving quantitative agreement between theory and experiment requires accounting for higher-order harmonics in the transmon Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithms for permutation-based combinatorial problems: Optimal ansatz generation with applications to quadratic assignment problems and beyond</title>

Abstract: We present a quantum variational algorithm based on a novel circuit that generates all permutations that can be spanned by one- and two-qubits permutation gates. The construction of the circuits follows from group-theoretical results, most importantly the Bruhat decomposition of the group generated by the \(\mathtt{cx}\) gates. These circuits require a number of qubits that scale logarithmically with the permutation dimension, and are therefore employable in near-term applications. We further augment the circuits with ancilla qubits to enlarge their span, and with these we build ansatze to tackle permutation-based optimization problems such as quadratic assignment problems, and graph isomorphisms. The resulting quantum algorithm, \textsc{QuPer}, is competitive with respect to classical heuristics and we could simulate its behavior up to a problem with $256$ variables, requiring $20$ qubits.</description>

      <title>High resolution quantum enhanced phase imaging of cells</title>

Abstract: Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a fundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to operate at low photon doses to avoid altering the sample, particularly in biological applications. Quantum imaging provides a powerful route to extract more information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately limited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction and spatial resolution has long been regarded as a major obstacle to the application of quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they could offer the greatest benefits. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells based on the transport-of-intensity equation, enabling high-fidelity, label-free imaging of key cellular and sub-cellular features. We achieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture, while simultaneously obtaining a resolution-independent quantum advantage. Unlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a quasi-single-shot, wide-field configuration, retrieves both phase and amplitude information, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it intrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate application of sub-shot-noise imaging in biological microscopy.</description>

      <title>An exact Markovian decoherence dynamics of two interacting harmonic oscillators coupled to a bosonic heat bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics, quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators, which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.</description>

      <title>On the commutator scaling in Hamiltonian simulation with multi-product formulas</title>

Abstract: A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian simulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable error $1/\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\varepsilon$ like LCU [G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency in $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and this appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested commutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large $q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the locality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the cost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping the $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will provide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using interpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.</description>

      <title>Effective reflection mode measurement for hanger-coupled microwave resonators</title>

Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are used in many low-power applications, such as the study of two-level system loss in superconducting quantum devices. Fano asymmetry, characterized by a nonzero asymmetry angle $\phi$ in the diameter correction method, results from the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly used hanger method. $\phi$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no physically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of interest. The T-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which has no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as interference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the ERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission measurements. We utilize a three-dimensional aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the validity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this symmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a multiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate quantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM measurements. We observe a fivefold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM compared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, $-160$ dBm delivered to the device. This method could facilitate an increase in throughput of low-power superconducting resonator measurements by up to a factor of 25, as well as allow the extraction of critical parameters from otherwise unfittable device data.</description>

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI and QPIE perform a higher compression of image information than TNR and NEQR. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.</description>

      <title>Exact Relation Between Wehrl-R\'enyi Entropy and Many-Body Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is key to understanding correlations and emergent phenomena in quantum many-body systems. For $N$ qubits (distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles) in a pure quantum state, many-body entanglement can be characterized by the purity of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem, defined as the trace of the square of this reduced density matrix. Nevertheless, this approach depends on the choice of subsystem. In this letter, we establish an exact relation between the Wehrl-R\'enyi entropy (WRE) $S_W^{(2)}$, which is the 2nd R\'enyi entropy of the Husimi function of the entire system, and the purities of all possible subsystems. Specifically, we prove the relation $e^{-S_W^{(2)}} = (6\pi)^{-N} \sum_A \mathrm{Tr}({{\hat \rho}_A}^2)$, where $A$ denotes a subsystem with reduced density matrix ${\hat \rho}_A$, and the summation runs over all $2^N$ possible subsystems. Furthermore, we show that the WRE can be experimentally measured via a concrete scheme. Therefore, the WRE is a subsystem-independent and experimentally measurable characterization of the overall entanglement in pure states of $N$ qubits. It can be applied to the study of strongly correlated spin systems, particularly those with all-to-all couplings that do not have a natural subsystem division, such as systems realized with natural atoms in optical tweezer arrays or superconducting quantum circuits. We also analytically derive the WRE for several representative many-body states, including Haar-random states, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the W state.</description>

Abstract: Engineering coherent spatial superpositions of levitated large masses is an ongoing challenge. Borrowing from recent experimental work, we consider a charged mass of hundreds of nanometers size (``nanoparticle'') co-trapped with an ion in a Paul trap, and propose a scheme to manipulate its spatial state through the Coulomb interaction with the ion. We focus on the achievable delocalisation, only sketching the other challenges of the protocol (initial cooling, preservation of coherence for long-enough times, and detection). We prove that our scheme can displace coherently the nanoparticle by a few nanometers, with state-of-the-art parameters. Though smaller than the nanoparticle's size, this is much larger than the wavefunction of the trap's ground state. Thus the co-trapping scheme is in principle able to demonstrate macroscopic delocalisation of a charged nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic field approach for the control of dipole emission in integrated structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework to model spontaneous emission in integrated photonic structures by exploiting quantization of the electromagnetic field in terms of asymptotic in/out modes. This approach allows for an efficient and physically meaningful calculation of the emission rate into each radiative channel of an arbitrary structure, without relying on approximations such as Lorentzian lineshapes or point-like system-bath coupling. We show that with this approach one can recover well-known results for dipole emission in waveguides or ring resonators, and that such results can be easily extended to include the effect of backscattering. Finally, as an application, we design a tunable integrated single-photon source that enables full control over both the emission rate and output mode. This flexibility makes our method particularly well-suited for the design and analysis of integrated single-photon sources in various material platforms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preparation of Quantum States via Randomized Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the preparation of a general quantum state is challenging, realistic problem instances, such as those encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning-typically exhibit hierarchical amplitude structures, consisting of a small number of large components alongside a vast number of small but non-negligible ones. Standard approaches deterministically truncate the small amplitude would incur an approximation error that scales linearly with the discarded amplitude mass, enforcing a rigid trade-off between precision and circuit depth. Here, we circumvent the challenge by introducing a randomized state-preparation protocol with probabilistic amplification of small amplitudes using ensembles of low-complexity circuits. Analytically, we prove that this approach significantly reduces the number of encoded amplitudes, halving the requirement for exponentially decaying states and offering asymptotically larger gains for heavy-tailed power-law decays. Numerical simulations on LiH molecular wavefunctions and deep-learning-derived states demonstrate reductions of up to 99 percent in CNOT and T-gate counts compared with deterministic methods. These results establish a resource-efficient paradigm for initializing complex states, relaxing gate-synthesis precision requirements for both near-term and fault-tolerant hardware, and improving the end-to-end feasibility of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Modelling and experimental verification of photoelectrical response of NV diamond spin centres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.</description>

Abstract: Continuous-variables (CV) quantum optics is a natural formalism for neural networks (NNs) due to its ability to reproduce the information processing of such trainable interconnected systems. In quantum optics, Gaussian operators induce affine mappings on the quadratures of optical modes while non-Gaussian resources (the challenging piece for physical implementation) originate the nonlinear effects, unlocking quantum analogs of an artificial neuron. This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick-Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Experiments on supervised learning and state-preparation tasks show balanced-resource efficiency with strong expressivity and generalization capabilities, illustrating the potential of the architecture for scalable photonic quantum machine learning and for quantum applications such as complex non-Gaussian gate synthesis.</description>

Abstract: We study distributed similarity estimation of quantum channels (DSEC), a primitive for cross-platform verification where two remote quantum devices are compared by estimating the inner product of their Choi states. We show that the optimal channel query complexity of DSEC for two $d$-dimensional quantum channels is $\Theta(\max\{\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon, 1/\varepsilon^2\})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the additive error. We first prove an information-theoretic lower bound with this scaling, which holds even in the strongest setting, allowing adaptive strategies, multiple rounds of classical communication, and coherent access with arbitrary ancillas. We then give a matching upper bound in the weakest setting, namely non-adaptive and ancilla-free incoherent access, via a randomized measurement protocol achieving this bound. Finally, we show that our protocol achieves a quadratic improvement over classical shadow baselines. Our results provide theoretically optimal and practical methods for cross-platform verification, quantum device benchmarking, and distributed quantum learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments in which fault-tolerant devices access uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Introducing the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP''), we model noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot generally error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we prove that while noise can eliminate the exponential quantum learning advantages of unphysical, noiseless learners, a superpolynomial gap remains between $\textsf{NISQ}$ and fault-tolerant devices. Turning to canonical learning tasks in noisy settings, we find that the exponential two-copy advantage for purity testing collapses under local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient physical structure restores this quantum learning advantage. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds characterizing how instance size, quantum memory and noise jointly control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically matching scalings. We study similar tradeoffs in quantum metrology, and show that the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity of existing error-correction-based protocols persists only up to a timescale inverse-polynomial in the error rate per probe qubit. Together, our results demonstrate that the primitives underlying quantum-enhanced experiments are fundamentally fragile to noise, and that realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require interfacing noise-robust physical properties with available algorithmic techniques.</description>

      <title>Classical Second-Order Moments and Tensor Squeezing in Spin-1 Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a compact, frame-independent characterization of the set of classical second-order moments for a single spin-1 particle. Defining the moment matrix M = 2Q + (1/3) I, we show that a moment pair (s, Q) arises from a positive mixture of spin-coherent states if and only if M is positive semidefinite, M minus ss^T is positive semidefinite, and the trace of M equals one. These necessary and sufficient matrix conditions delimit the classical moment region and yield simple, basis-free witnesses of higher-order tensor nonclassicality, such as bounds on Tr(Q^2). A constructive proof of sufficiency is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

Abstract: Duality, not monism, constitutes the hermeneutic lens that characterizes the original Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, evoking the principles of correspondence and complementarity, in this work we re-assert a dual-aspect reading of quantum theory, structured through a multi-perspective schema encompassing its ontological, analytical, epistemological, causal, and information dimensions. We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called 'measurement problem', along with the associated 'knowledge-information' and 'macro-micro' dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit.</description>

      <title>Achieving the Heisenberg limit using fault-tolerant quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum effect enables enhanced estimation precision in metrology, with the Heisenberg limit (HL) representing the ultimate limit allowed by quantum mechanics. Although the HL is generally unattainable in the presence of noise, quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL in various scenarios. A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</description>

      <title>The PRODSAT phase of random quantum satisfiability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $k$-QSAT problem is a quantum analog of the famous $k$-SAT constraint satisfaction problem. We must determine the zero energy ground states of a Hamiltonian of $N$ qubits consisting of a sum of $M$ random $k$-local rank-one projectors. It is known that product states of zero energy exist with high probability if and only if the underlying factor graph has a clause-covering dimer configuration. This means that the threshold of the PRODSAT phase is a purely geometric quantity equal to the dimer covering threshold. We revisit and fully prove this result through a combination of complex analysis and algebraic methods based on Buchberger's algorithm for complex polynomial equations with random coefficients. We also discuss numerical experiments investigating the presence of entanglement in the PRODSAT phase in the sense that product states do not span the whole zero energy ground state space.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Unidirectional Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of quantum string are observed across various quantum simulation platforms. However, the complex interplay between the quantum strings cannot be well analyzed due to the limited system size in real quantum simulators. Here, with the help of a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a larger-scale Kagome Rydberg atom array, providing an ideal playground for studying quantum strings. By introducing a novel edge pinning method, the ends of a quantum string can be attached to edges so that the flexible manipulation of the quantum string becomes possible. Due to the geometric constraint, the quantum strings are unidirectional, which strongly complicates their interplay. To quantitatively describe the quantum string, we built a one-dimensional effective model. With both analytic and numerical methods, rich physics can be found, including ``geometric breaking", heart-like superposition state of quantum strings, and the attractive inter-string interactions. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and may also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>A Classifying Space for Phases of Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a topological space $\mathcal{B}$ consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions and show that it has the weak homotopy type $K(\mathbb{Z}, 2) \times K(\mathbb{Z}, 3)$. The implication is that the phase of a family of such states parametrized by a space $X$ is completely determined by two invariants: a class in $H^2(X; \mathbb{Z})$ corresponding to the Chern number per unit cell and a class in $H^3(X; \mathbb{Z})$, the so-called Kapustin-Spodyneiko (KS) number. The space $\mathcal{B}$ is defined as the quotient of a contractible space $\mathcal{E}$ of MPS tensors by an equivalence relation describing gauge transformations of the tensors. We prove that the projection map $p:\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ is a quasifibration, and this allows us to determine the weak homotopy type of $\mathcal{B}$. As an example, we review the Chern number pump-a family of MPS parametrized by $S^3$-and prove that it generates $\pi_3(\mathcal{B})$.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing and understanding the physical properties of quantum many-body non-Hermitian systems is a challenging task. In this work, we generalize the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices and find many novel phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian many-body systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), as well as in the standard quantum limit (SQL) and photon shot limit (PSL) regimes, respectively. Furthermore, we unveil that the EAR scales logarithmically without bound with the product of effective number $N_{\text{atom}}$ and coherence time $T_2$ of the atomic ensemble in the SQL regime, but exhibits non-monotonic trade-off between the collective atomic enhancement and optical-depth-dependent attenuation in the PSL regime. More particularly, the transmit power of users can be scaled down quadratically with $N_{\text{atom}} \tau$, $\tau \in \{ T_2, \frac{ {\cal C} (\Omega_{\ell}) }{A_p} \}$, but the EAR per user retains fixed, by increasing $N_{\text{atom}}$ while retaining the sensor number $M \propto N_{\text{atom}} \tau$ in the SQL regime or $M \propto \exp \big( \frac{N_{\text{atom}} {\bar \chi}}{A_p} \big)$ in the PSL regime....</description>

Abstract: Diamond and diamond color centers have become prime hardware candidates for solid state-based technologies in quantum information and computing, optics, photonics and (bio)sensing. The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here, we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.</description>

      <title>Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. Specifically, we observe that voltage pulses on nearby gates tend to increase TLF switching rates and occupation biases. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.</description>

      <title>Collective resonance displacement in strongly driven cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms are promising platforms for metrology and quantum computation, yet their many-body dynamics remains largely unexplored. We here investigate Rabi oscillations from optically-thick cold clouds, driven by high-intensity coherent light. A dynamical displacement from the atomic resonance is predicted, which can be detected through the collective Rabi oscillations of the atomic ensemble. Different from linear-optics shifts, this dynamical displacement grows quadratically with the optical depth, yet it reduces with increasing pump power as dipole-dipole interactions are less effective.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the 1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this transition, finding the exact location of the spin-spiral instability.</description>
