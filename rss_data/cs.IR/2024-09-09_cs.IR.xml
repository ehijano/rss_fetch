      <title>VERA: Validation and Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in various applications necessitates stringent protocols to ensure RAG systems accuracy, safety, and alignment with user intentions. In this paper, we introduce VERA (Validation and Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Systems), a framework designed to enhance the transparency and reliability of outputs from large language models (LLMs) that utilize retrieved information. VERA improves the way we evaluate RAG systems in two important ways: (1) it introduces a cross-encoder based mechanism that encompasses a set of multidimensional metrics into a single comprehensive ranking score, addressing the challenge of prioritizing individual metrics, and (2) it employs Bootstrap statistics on LLM-based metrics across the document repository to establish confidence bounds, ensuring the repositorys topical coverage and improving the overall reliability of retrieval systems. Through several use cases, we demonstrate how VERA can strengthen decision-making processes and trust in AI applications. Our findings not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of LLM-based RAG evaluation metric but also promote the practical implementation of responsible AI systems, marking a significant advancement in the development of reliable and transparent generative AI technologies.</description>

      <title>It's Not You, It's Me: The Impact of Choice Models and Ranking Strategies on Gender Imbalance in Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As recommender systems are prone to various biases, mitigation approaches are needed to ensure that recommendations are fair to various stakeholders. One particular concern in music recommendation is artist gender fairness. Recent work has shown that the gender imbalance in the sector translates to the output of music recommender systems, creating a feedback loop that can reinforce gender biases over time. In this work, we examine that feedback loop to study whether algorithmic strategies or user behavior are a greater contributor to ongoing improvement (or loss) in fairness as models are repeatedly re-trained on new user feedback data. We simulate user interaction and re-training to investigate the effects of ranking strategies and user choice models on gender fairness metrics. We find re-ranking strategies have a greater effect than user choice models on recommendation fairness over time.</description>

      <title>RETAIN: Interactive Tool for Regression Testing Guided LLM Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse applications. The rapid evolution of LLMs presents opportunities for developers to enhance applications continuously. However, this constant adaptation can also lead to performance regressions during model migrations. While several interactive tools have been proposed to streamline the complexity of prompt engineering, few address the specific requirements of regression testing for LLM Migrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce RETAIN (REgression Testing guided LLM migrAtIoN), a tool designed explicitly for regression testing in LLM Migrations. RETAIN comprises two key components: an interactive interface tailored to regression testing needs during LLM migrations, and an error discovery module that facilitates understanding of differences in model behaviors. The error discovery module generates textual descriptions of various errors or differences between model outputs, providing actionable insights for prompt refinement. Our automatic evaluation and empirical user studies demonstrate that RETAIN, when compared to manual evaluation, enabled participants to identify twice as many errors, facilitated experimentation with 75% more prompts, and achieves 12% higher metric scores in a given time frame.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sequential Music Recommendation with Personalized Popularity Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommender systems have shown promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. Nevertheless, traditional Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, while effective, encounter challenges due to the unique characteristics of music listening habits. In fact, existing models struggle to create a coherent listening experience due to rapidly evolving preferences. Moreover, music consumption is characterized by a prevalence of repeated listening, i.e., users frequently return to their favourite tracks, an important signal that could be framed as individual or personalized popularity.
  This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach that incorporates personalized popularity information into sequential recommendation. By combining user-item popularity scores with model-generated scores, our method effectively balances the exploration of new music with the satisfaction of user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that a Personalized Most Popular recommender, a method solely based on user-specific popularity, outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, augmenting Transformer-based models with personalized popularity awareness yields superior performance, showing improvements ranging from 25.2% to 69.8%.

      <title>How Fair is Your Diffusion Recommender Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based recommender systems have recently proven to outperform traditional generative recommendation approaches, such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Nevertheless, the machine learning literature has raised several concerns regarding the possibility that diffusion models, while learning the distribution of data samples, may inadvertently carry information bias and lead to unfair outcomes. In light of this aspect, and considering the relevance that fairness has held in recommendations over the last few decades, we conduct one of the first fairness investigations in the literature on DiffRec, a pioneer approach in diffusion-based recommendation. First, we propose an experimental setting involving DiffRec (and its variant L-DiffRec) along with nine state-of-the-art recommendation models, two popular recommendation datasets from the fairness-aware literature, and six metrics accounting for accuracy and consumer/provider fairness. Then, we perform a twofold analysis, one assessing models' performance under accuracy and recommendation fairness separately, and the other identifying if and to what extent such metrics can strike a performance trade-off. Experimental results from both studies confirm the initial unfairness warnings but pave the way for how to address them in future research directions.</description>

      <title>Understanding Fairness in Recommender Systems: A Healthcare Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03893v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness in AI-driven decision-making systems has become a critical concern, especially when these systems directly affect human lives. This paper explores the public's comprehension of fairness in healthcare recommendations. We conducted a survey where participants selected from four fairness metrics -- Demographic Parity, Equal Accuracy, Equalized Odds, and Positive Predictive Value -- across different healthcare scenarios to assess their understanding of these concepts. Our findings reveal that fairness is a complex and often misunderstood concept, with a generally low level of public understanding regarding fairness metrics in recommender systems. This study highlights the need for enhanced information and education on algorithmic fairness to support informed decision-making in using these systems. Furthermore, the results suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to fairness may be insufficient, pointing to the importance of context-sensitive designs in developing equitable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Refining Wikidata Taxonomy using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its collaborative nature, Wikidata is known to have a complex taxonomy, with recurrent issues like the ambiguity between instances and classes, the inaccuracy of some taxonomic paths, the presence of cycles, and the high level of redundancy across classes. Manual efforts to clean up this taxonomy are time-consuming and prone to errors or subjective decisions. We present WiKC, a new version of Wikidata taxonomy cleaned automatically using a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph mining techniques. Operations on the taxonomy, such as cutting links or merging classes, are performed with the help of zero-shot prompting on an open-source LLM. The quality of the refined taxonomy is evaluated from both intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives, on a task of entity typing for the latter, showing the practical interest of WiKC.</description>

      <title>WarpAdam: A new Adam optimizer based on Meta-Learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal selection of optimization algorithms is crucial for training deep learning models. The Adam optimizer has gained significant attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability. However, to enhance the adaptability of optimizers across diverse datasets, we propose an innovative optimization strategy by integrating the 'warped gradient descend'concept from Meta Learning into the Adam optimizer. In the conventional Adam optimizer, gradients are utilized to compute estimates of gradient mean and variance, subsequently updating model parameters. Our approach introduces a learnable distortion matrix, denoted as P, which is employed for linearly transforming gradients. This transformation slightly adjusts gradients during each iteration, enabling the optimizer to better adapt to distinct dataset characteristics. By learning an appropriate distortion matrix P, our method aims to adaptively adjust gradient information across different data distributions, thereby enhancing optimization performance. Our research showcases the potential of this novel approach through theoretical insights and empirical evaluations. Experimental results across various tasks and datasets validate the superiority of our optimizer that integrates the 'warped gradient descend' concept in terms of adaptability. Furthermore, we explore effective strategies for training the adaptation matrix P and identify scenarios where this method can yield optimal results. In summary, this study introduces an innovative approach that merges the 'warped gradient descend' concept from Meta Learning with the Adam optimizer. By introducing a learnable distortion matrix P within the optimizer, we aim to enhance the model's generalization capability across diverse data distributions, thus opening up new possibilities in the field of deep learning optimization.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Knowledge Organization Systems of Research Fields: Resources and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.</description>

      <title>Hi-Gen: Generative Retrieval For Large-Scale Personalized E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging generative retrieval (GR) techniques to enhance search systems is an emerging methodology that has shown promising results in recent years. In GR, a text-to-text model maps string queries directly to relevant document identifiers (docIDs), dramatically simplifying the retrieval process. However, when applying most GR models in large-scale E-commerce for personalized item search, we must face two key problems in encoding and decoding. (1) Existing docID generation methods ignore the encoding of efficiency information, which is critical in E-commerce. (2) The positional information is important in decoding docIDs, while prior studies have not adequately discriminated the significance of positional information or well exploited the inherent interrelation among these positions. To overcome these problems, we introduce an efficient Hierarchical encoding-decoding Generative retrieval method (Hi-Gen) for large-scale personalized E-commerce search systems. Specifically, we first design a representation learning model using metric learning to learn discriminative feature representations of items to capture semantic relevance and efficiency information. Then, we propose a category-guided hierarchical clustering scheme that makes full use of the semantic and efficiency information of items to facilitate docID generation. Finally, we design a position-aware loss to discriminate the importance of positions and mine the inherent interrelation between different tokens at the same position. This loss boosts the performance of the language model used in the decoding stage. Besides, we propose two variants of Hi-Gen (Hi-Gen-I2I and Hi-Gen-Cluster) to support online real-time large-scale recall in the online serving process. Hi-Gen gets 3.30% and 4.62% improvements over SOTA for Recall@1 on the public and industry datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Behavior-Dependent Linear Recurrent Units for Efficient Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems aims to predict the users' next interaction through user behavior modeling with various operators like RNNs and attentions. However, existing models generally fail to achieve the three golden principles for sequential recommendation simultaneously, i.e., training efficiency, low-cost inference, and strong performance. To this end, we propose RecBLR, an Efficient Sequential Recommendation Model based on Behavior-Dependent Linear Recurrent Units to accomplish the impossible triangle of the three principles. By incorporating gating mechanisms and behavior-dependent designs into linear recurrent units, our model significantly enhances user behavior modeling and recommendation performance. Furthermore, we unlock the parallelizable training as well as inference efficiency for our model by designing a hardware-aware scanning acceleration algorithm with a customized CUDA kernel. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with varying lengths of user behavior sequences demonstrate RecBLR's remarkable effectiveness in simultaneously achieving all three golden principles - strong recommendation performance, training efficiency, and low-cost inference, while exhibiting excellent scalability to datasets with long user interaction histories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional keyword-based search in understanding user intent and introduces a novel hybrid search approach that leverages the strengths of non-semantic search engines, Large Language Models (LLMs), and embedding models. The proposed system integrates keyword matching, semantic vector embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to deliver highly relevant and contextually appropriate search results. By combining these complementary methods, the hybrid approach effectively captures both explicit and implicit user intent.The paper further explores techniques to optimize query execution for faster response times and demonstrates the effectiveness of this hybrid search model in producing comprehensive and accurate search outcomes.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Topic Classification of Column Headers: Leveraging LLMs for Metadata Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional dataset retrieval systems rely on metadata for indexing, rather than on the underlying data values. However, high-quality metadata creation and enrichment often require manual annotations, which is a labour-intensive and challenging process to automate. In this study, we propose a method to support metadata enrichment using topic annotations generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard, and GoogleGemini. Our analysis focuses on classifying column headers based on domain-specific topics from the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), a Linked Data controlled vocabulary. Our approach operates in a zero-shot setting, integrating the controlled topic vocabulary directly within the input prompt. This integration serves as a Large Context Windows approach, with the aim of improving the results of the topic classification task.
  We evaluated the performance of the LLMs in terms of internal consistency, inter-machine alignment, and agreement with human classification. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e., dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard in terms of internal consistency as well as LLM-human-agreement. Interestingly, we found that contextual information had no significant impact on LLM performance.
  This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for topic classification of column headers using a controlled vocabulary, presenting a practical application of LLMs and Large Context Windows within the Semantic Web domain. This approach has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.</description>

      <title>MedPromptExtract (Medical Data Extraction Tool): Anonymization and Hi-fidelity Automated data extraction using NLP and prompt engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: The labour-intensive nature of data extraction from sources like discharge summaries (DS) poses significant obstacles to the digitisation of medical records particularly for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this paper we present a completely automated method MedPromptExtract to efficiently extract data from DS while maintaining confidentiality. Methods: The source of data was Discharge Summaries (DS) from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) of patients having Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). A pre-existing tool EIGEN which leverages semi-supervised learning techniques for high-fidelity information extraction was used to anonymize the DS, Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to extract data from regular fields. We used Prompt Engineering and Large Language Model(LLM) to extract custom clinical information from free flowing text describing the patients stay in the hospital. Twelve features associated with occurrence of AKI were extracted. The LLM responses were validated against clinicians annotations. Results: The MedPromptExtracttool first subjected DS to the anonymization pipeline which took three seconds per summary. Successful anonymization was verified by clinicians, thereafter NLP pipeline extracted structured text from the anonymized pdfs at the rate of 0.2 seconds per summary with 100% accuracy.Finally DS were analysed by the LLM pipeline using Gemini Pro for the twelve features. Accuracy metrics were calculated by comparing model responses to clinicians annotations with seven features achieving AUCs above 0.9, indicating high fidelity of the extraction process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown versatility in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including their potential as effective question-answering systems. However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance. Our findings suggest that RAG-based LLMs can be an excellent support to human customer service representatives by lightening their workload.</description>
