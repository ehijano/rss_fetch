      <title>Geometric and Thermodynamic Properties of Frolov Black Holes with Topological Defects</title>

Abstract: We investigated a modified Frolov black hole (BH) model that incorporates both a global monopole (GM) and a cosmic string (CS) to explore the interplay between non-singular BH regularization and topological defect effects. In our study, we derived a spacetime metric characterized by a regulated core through a length scale parameter $\alpha$ and introduced additional modifications via the GM parameter $\eta$ and the CS parameter $a$, which collectively alter the horizon structure and causal geometry of the BH. We analyzed the thermodynamic properties by deriving expressions for the mass function, Hawking temperature, and entropy, and found that the inclusion of GM and CS significantly deviates the BH entropy from the conventional Bekenstein-Hawking area law, while numerical investigations showed that the shadow radius exhibits contrasting behaviors: the Frolov parameters tend to reduce the shadow size whereas the topological defects enhance it. Furthermore, we examined the dynamics of scalar and electromagnetic perturbations by solving the massless Klein-Gordon equation in the BH background and computed the quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the WKB approximation, which confirmed the BH's stability and revealed that the oscillation frequencies and damping rates are strongly dependent on the parameters $\alpha$, $q$, $\eta$, and $a$. Our results suggest that the distinct observational signatures arising from this composite BH model may provide a promising avenue for testing modified gravity theories in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Formation of Magnetic Switchbacks via expanding Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Large-amplitude inversions of the solar wind's interplanetary magnetic field have long been documented; however, observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission have renewed interest in this phenomenon as such features, often termed switchbacks, may constrain both the sources of the solar wind as well as in-situ nonlinear dynamics and turbulent heating. Aims. We aim to show that magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are consistent with Alfv\'enic fluctuations that naturally form switchback inversions in the magnetic field through expansion effects. Methods. We examine PSP observations of the evolution of a single stream of solar wind in a radial scan from PSP's tenth perihelion encounter from approximately 15-50 solar radii. We study the growth and radial scaling of normalized fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, within the framework of spherical polarization. We compare heating rates computed via outer-scale decay from consideration of wave-action to proton heating rates empirically observed through considering adiabatic expansion. Results. We find that the magnetic field fluctuations are largely spherically polarized and that the normalized amplitudes of the magnetic field, $\delta B/B$, increases with amplitude. The growth of the magnetic field amplitude leads to switchback inversions in the magnetic field. While the amplitudes do not grow as fast as predicted by the conservation of wave action, the deviation from the expected scaling yields an effective heating rate, which is close to the empirically observed proton heating rate. Conclusions. The observed scaling of fluctuation amplitudes is largely consistent with a picture of expanding Alfv\'en waves that seed turbulence leading to dissipation. The expansion of the waves leads to the growth of wave-amplitudes, resulting in the formation of switchbacks.</description>
