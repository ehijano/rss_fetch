      <title>From Prompt to Product: A Human-Centered Benchmark of Agentic App Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of generating full-stack web applications from natural language prompts ("prompt- to-app") represent a significant shift in software development. However, evaluating these systems remains challenging, as visual polish, functional correctness, and user trust are often misaligned. As a result, it is unclear how existing prompt-to-app tools compare under realistic, human-centered evaluation criteria. In this paper, we introduce a human-centered benchmark for evaluating prompt-to-app systems and conduct a large-scale comparative study of three widely used platforms: Replit, Bolt, and Firebase Studio. Using a diverse set of 96 prompts spanning common web application tasks, we generate 288 unique application artifacts. We evaluate these systems through a large-scale human-rater study involving 205 participants and 1,071 quality-filtered pairwise comparisons, assessing task-based ease of use, visual appeal, perceived completeness, and user trust. Our results show that these systems are not interchangeable: Firebase Studio consistently outperforms competing platforms across all human-evaluated dimensions, achieving the highest win rates for ease of use, trust, visual appeal, and visual appropriateness. Bolt performs competitively on visual appeal but trails Firebase on usability and trust, while Replit underperforms relative to both across most metrics. These findings highlight a persistent gap between visual polish and functional reliability in prompt-to-app systems and demonstrate the necessity of interactive, task-based evaluation. We release our benchmark framework, prompt set, and generated artifacts to support reproducible evaluation and future research in agentic application generation.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction Considered Harmful (Some of the Time)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual analytics now plays a central role in decision-making across diverse disciplines, but it can be unreliable: the knowledge or insights derived from the analysis may not accurately reflect the underlying data. In this dissertation, we improve the reliability of visual analytics with a focus on dimensionality reduction (DR). DR techniques enable visual analysis of high-dimensional data by reducing it to two or three dimensions, but they inherently introduce errors that can compromise the reliability of visual analytics. To this end, I investigate reliability challenges that practitioners face when using DR for visual analytics. Then, I propose technical solutions to address these challenges, including new evaluation metrics, optimization strategies, and interaction techniques. We conclude the thesis by discussing how our contributions lay the foundation for achieving more reliable visual analytics practices.</description>

      <title>The Social Blindspot in Human-AI Collaboration: How Undetected AI Personas Reshape Team Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI systems become increasingly embedded in collaborative work, they are evolving from visible tools into human-like communicative actors that participate socially rather than merely providing information. Yet little is known about how such agents shape team dynamics when their artificial nature is not recognised, a growing concern as human-like AI is deployed at scale in education, organisations, and civic contexts where collaboration underpins collective outcomes. In a large-scale mixed-design experiment (N = 905), we examined how AI teammates with distinct communicative personas, supportive or contrarian, affected collaboration across analytical, creative, and ethical tasks. Participants worked in triads that were fully human or hybrid human-AI teams, without being informed of AI involvement. Results show that participants had limited ability to detect AI teammates, yet AI personas exerted robust social effects. Contrarian personas reduced psychological safety and discussion quality, whereas supportive personas improved discussion quality without affecting safety. These effects persisted after accounting for individual differences in detectability, revealing a dissociation between influence and awareness that we term the social blindspot. Linguistic analyses confirmed that personas were enacted through systematic differences in affective and relational language, with partial mediation for discussion quality but largely direct effects on psychological safety. Together, the findings demonstrate that AI systems can tacitly regulate collaborative norms through persona-level cues, even when users remain unaware of their presence. We argue that persona design constitutes a form of social governance in hybrid teams, with implications for the responsible deployment of AI in collective settings.</description>

      <title>Emergent Learner Agency in Implicit Human-AI Collaboration: How AI Personas Reshape Creative-Regulatory Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly embedded in collaborative learning, yet little is known about how AI personas shape learner agency when AI teammates are present but not disclosed. This mechanism study examines how supportive and contrarian AI personas reconfigure emergent learner agency, discourse patterns, and experiences in implicit human-AI creative collaboration. A total of 224 university students were randomly assigned to 97 online triads in one of three conditions: human-only control, hybrid teams with a supportive AI, or hybrid teams with a contrarian AI. Participants completed an individual-group-individual movie-plot writing task; the 10-minute group chat was coded using a creative-regulatory framework. We combined transition network analysis, theory-driven sequential pattern mining, and Gaussian mixture clustering to model structural, temporal, and profile-level manifestations of agency, and linked these to cognitive load, psychological safety, teamwork satisfaction, and embedding-based creative performance. Contrarian AI produced challenge- and reflection-rich discourse structures and motifs indicating productive friction, whereas supportive AI fostered agreement-centred trajectories and smoother convergence. Clustering showed AI agents concentrated in challenger profiles, with reflective regulation uniquely human. While no systematic differences emerged in cognitive load or creative gains, contrarian AI consistently reduced teamwork satisfaction and psychological safety. The findings reveal a design tension between leveraging cognitive conflict and maintaining affective safety and ownership in hybrid human-AI teams.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Peer, Self, and Teacher Assessments for Generative AI-Enhanced Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing timely and meaningful feedback remains a persistent challenge in higher education, especially in large courses where teachers must balance formative depth with scalability. Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offer new opportunities to support feedback processes while maintaining human oversight. This paper presents an study conducted within the AICoFe (AI-based Collaborative Feedback) system, which integrates teacher, peer, and self-assessments of engineering students' oral presentations. Using a validated rubric, 46 evaluation sets were analyzed to examine agreement, correlation, and bias across evaluators. The analyses revealed consistent overall alignment among sources but also systematic variations in scoring behavior, reflecting distinct evaluative perspectives. These findings informed the proposal of an enhanced GenAI model within AICoFe system, designed to integrate human assessments through weighted input aggregation, bias detection, and context-aware feedback generation. The study contributes empirical evidence and design principles for developing GenAI-based feedback systems that combine data-based efficiency with pedagogical validity and transparency.</description>

      <title>Exploration vs. Fixation: Scaffolding Divergent and Convergent Thinking for Human-AI Co-Creation with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has begun to democratize creative work, enabling novices to produce complex artifacts such as code, images, and videos. However, in practice, existing interaction paradigms often fail to support divergent exploration: users tend to converge too quickly on early ``good enough'' results and struggle to move beyond them, leading to premature convergence and design fixation that constrains their creative potential. To address this, we propose a structured, process-oriented human-AI co-creation paradigm including divergent and convergent thinking stages, grounded in Wallas's model of creativity. To avoid design fixation, our paradigm scaffolds both high-level exploration of conceptual ideas in the early divergent thinking phase and low-level exploration of variations in the later convergent thinking phrase. We instantiate this paradigm in HAIExplore, an image co-creation system that (i) scaffolds divergent thinking through a dedicated brainstorming stage for exploring high-level ideas in a conceptual space, and (ii) scaffolds convergent refinement through an interface that externalizes users' refinement intentions as interpretable parameters and options, making the refinement process more controllable and easier to explore. We report on a within-subjects study comparing HAIExplore with a widely used linear chat interface (ChatGPT) for creative image generation. Our findings show that explicitly scaffolding the creative process into brainstorming and refinement stages can mitigate design fixation, improve perceived controllability and alignment with users' intentions, and better support the non-linear nature of creative work. We conclude with design implications for future creativity support tools and human-AI co-creation workflows.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Mind: Earable Acoustic Sensing of Cognitive Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earable acoustic sensing offers a powerful and non-invasive modality for capturing fine-grained auditory and physiological signals directly from the ear canal, enabling continuous and context-aware monitoring of cognitive states. As earable devices become increasingly embedded in daily life, they provide a unique opportunity to sense mental effort and perceptual load in real time through auditory interactions. In this study, we present the first investigation of cognitive load inference through auditory perception using acoustic signals captured by off-the-shelf in-ear devices. We designed speech-based listening tasks to induce varying levels of cognitive load, while concurrently embedding acoustic stimuli to evoke Stimulus Frequency Otoacoustic Emission (SFOAEs) as a proxy for cochlear responsiveness. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association (p &lt; 0.01) between increased cognitive load and changes in auditory sensitivity, with 63.2% of participants showing peak sensitivity at 3 kHz. Notably, sensitivity patterns also varied across demographic subgroups, suggesting opportunities for personalized sensing. Our findings demonstrate that earable acoustic sensing can support scalable, real-time cognitive load monitoring in natural settings, laying a foundation for future applications in augmented cognition, where everyday auditory technologies adapt to and support the users mental health.</description>

      <title>DASH: Deception-Augmented Shared Mental Model for a Human-Machine Teaming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DASH (Deception-Augmented Shared mental model for Human-machine teaming), a novel framework that enhances mission resilience by embedding proactive deception into Shared Mental Models (SMM). Designed for mission-critical applications such as surveillance and rescue, DASH introduces "bait tasks" to detect insider threats, e.g., compromised Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), AI agents, or human analysts, before they degrade team performance. Upon detection, tailored recovery mechanisms are activated, including UGV system reinstallation, AI model retraining, or human analyst replacement. In contrast to existing SMM approaches that neglect insider risks, DASH improves both coordination and security. Empirical evaluations across four schemes (DASH, SMM-only, no-SMM, and baseline) show that DASH sustains approximately 80% mission success under high attack rates, eight times higher than the baseline. This work contributes a practical human-AI teaming framework grounded in shared mental models, a deception-based strategy for insider threat detection, and empirical evidence of enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions. DASH establishes a foundation for secure, adaptive human-machine teaming in contested environments.</description>

      <title>Household Plastic Recycling: Empirical Insights and Design Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines household plastic recycling in Finland through two qualitative studies and four design concepts. Study 1 reports short interviews with residents about how they store, sort, and dispose of plastic packaging in their homes. The findings highlight recurring frictions: limited space, improvised storage, uncertainty about correct sorting, and difficulties with bulky or dirty items. Study 2 focuses on laundry detergent packaging as a common source of large plastic containers. Participants' purchase decisions prioritised price and cleaning performance, while expressing concern for environmental impact and confusion about materials, rinsing, and recyclability.
  Building on these insights, four student groups designed interactive recycling concepts that combine physical bins or bags with mobile applications. The concepts explore modular storage, sensing and compaction, playful feedback, and reward schemes to support domestic recycling routines. Together, the studies and concepts point to design opportunities at the intersection of packaging, home infrastructure, and digital services, while also raising questions about feasibility, privacy, and the cost of new devices.</description>

      <title>Narrative Scaffolding: Transforming Data-Driven Sensemaking Through Narrative-First Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When exploring data, analysts construct narratives about what the data means by asking questions, generating visualizations, reflecting on patterns, and revising their interpretations as new insights emerge. Yet existing analysis tools treat narrative as an afterthought, breaking the link between reasoning, reflection, and the evolving story from exploration. Consequently, analysts lose the ability to see how their reasoning evolves, making it harder to reflect systematically or build coherent explanations. To address this gap, we propose Narrative Scaffolding, a framework for narrative-driven exploration that positions narrative construction as the primary interface for exploration and reasoning. We implement this framework in a system that externalizes iterative reasoning through narrative-first entry, semantically aligned view generation, and reflection support via insight provenance and inquiry tracking. In a within-subject study N=20, we demonstrate that narrative scaffolding facilitates broader exploration, deeper reflection, and more defensible narratives. An evaluation with visualization literacy experts (N = 6) confirmed that the system produced outputs aligned with narrative intent and facilitated intentional exploration.</description>

      <title>Advancing Accessibility: Augmented Reality Solutions for the Blind and Disabled in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technology holds immense potential to transform the lives of blind and disabled individuals by offering enhanced interaction with their surroundings and providing real-time, accessible information. Globally, AR applications are being developed with features such as audio descriptions of environments, object recognition, and navigational aids, specifically designed to support the visually impaired. These innovations are paving the way for increased independence, mobility, and overall quality of life for millions of people worldwide. In Bangladesh, the adoption of AR technology for the blind and disabled is still in its early stages, primarily due to limited accessibility resources and infrastructure challenges. However, with the growing penetration of smartphones and continuous advancements in AR technologies, there is a promising opportunity for these solutions to be adapted, localized, and scaled within the country. This paper reviews the current state of AR technologies for the visually impaired on a global scale, explores their potential application in Bangladesh, and delves into the challenges and opportunities for broader implementation in this context.</description>

      <title>Towards a collaborative digital platform for railway infrastructure projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The management of railway infrastructure projects can be supported by collaborative digital platforms. A survey was carried out to identify the needs and expectations of the various stakeholders involved in the design and construction of railway infrastructure projects regarding collaborative platforms. These needs and expectations can then be translated into functional specifications to be included in the digital platforms. A total of 21 interviews were conducted between October and December 2022, during which 35 individuals were interviewed. Key roles were represented across the different project phases: engineers from design and construction firms, project managers, infrastructure managers. And various engineering fields were represented: civil, electrical, telecommunications, tracks, systems. These interviews were carried out by CentraleSup{\'e}lec | Universit{\'e} Paris-Saclay and by SNCF R{\'e}seau using a structured protocol designed to collect the specific needs of the interviewees for collaboration, as well as the guiding principles that shape both individual work practices and collaboration between professions. The resulting material was analyzed and then synthesized into a conceptual model of a collaborative digital platform for supporting the design and construction phases in a railway infrastructure project. Also, from these interviews emerged five core functionalities that the platform must offer: Providing access to existing infrastructure data; Accelerating repetitive tasks; Verifying essential project requirements; Supporting decision-making; Facilitating coordination among stakeholders.</description>

      <title>The Epistemological Consequences of Large Language Models: Rethinking collective intelligence and institutional knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine epistemological threats posed by human and LLM interaction. We develop collective epistemology as a theory of epistemic warrant distributed across human collectives, using bounded rationality and dual process theory as background. We distinguish internalist justification, defined as reflective understanding of why a proposition is true, from externalist justification, defined as reliable transmission of truths. Both are necessary for collective rationality, but only internalist justification produces reflective knowledge. We specify reflective knowledge as follows: agents understand the evaluative basis of a claim, when that basis is unavailable agents consistently assess the reliability of truth sources, and agents have a duty to apply these standards within their domains of competence. We argue that LLMs approximate externalist reliabilism because they can reliably transmit information whose justificatory basis is established elsewhere, but they do not themselves possess reflective justification. Widespread outsourcing of reflective work to reliable LLM outputs can weaken reflective standards of justification, disincentivize comprehension, and reduce agents' capacity to meet professional and civic epistemic duties. To mitigate these risks, we propose a three tier norm program that includes an epistemic interaction model for individual use, institutional and organizational frameworks that seed and enforce norms for epistemically optimal outcomes, and deontic constraints at organizational and or legislative levels that instantiate discursive norms and curb epistemic vices.</description>

      <title>Design and Integration of Thermal and Vibrotactile Feedback for Lifelike Touch in Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zoomorphic Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) offer an alternative source of social touch for individuals who cannot access animal companionship. However, current SARs provide only limited, passive touch-based interactions and lack the rich haptic cues, such as warmth, heartbeat or purring, that are characteristic of human-animal touch. This limits their ability to evoke emotionally engaging, life-like physical interactions.
  We present a multimodal tactile prototype, which was used to augment the established PARO robot, integrating thermal and vibrotactile feedback to simulate feeling biophysiological signals. A flexible heating interface delivers body-like warmth, while embedded actuators generate heartbeat-like rhythms and continuous purring sensations. These cues were iteratively designed and calibrated with input from users and haptics experts. We outline the design process and offer reproducible guidelines to support the development of emotionally resonant and biologically plausible touch interactions with SARs.</description>

      <title>Characterising Behavioural Families and Dynamics of Promotional Twitter Bots via Sequence-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper asks whether promotional Twitter/X bots form behavioural families and whether members evolve similarly. We analyse 2,798,672 tweets from 2,615 ground-truth promotional bot accounts (2006-2021), focusing on complete years 2009 to 2020. Each bot is encoded as a sequence of symbolic blocks (``digital DNA'') from seven categorical post-level behavioural features (posting action, URL, media, text duplication, hashtags, emojis, sentiment), preserving temporal order only. Using non-overlapping blocks (k=7), cosine similarity over block-frequency vectors, and hierarchical clustering, we obtain four coherent families: Unique Tweeters, Duplicators with URLs, Content Multipliers, and Informed Contributors. Families share behavioural cores but differ systematically in engagement strategies and life-cycle dynamics (beginning/middle/end). We then model behavioural change as mutations. Within each family we align sequences via multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and label events as insertions, deletions, substitutions, alterations, and identity. This quantifies mutation rates, change-prone blocks/features, and mutation hotspots. Deletions and substitutions dominate, insertions are rare, and mutation profiles differ by family, with hotspots early for some families and dispersed for others. Finally, we test predictive value: bots within the same family share mutations more often than bots across families; closer bots share and propagate mutations more than distant ones; and responses to external triggers (e.g., Christmas, Halloween) follow family-specific, partly predictable patterns. Overall, sequence-based family modelling plus mutation analysis provides a fine-grained account of how promotional bot behaviour adapts over time.</description>

      <title>Software Vulnerability Management in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: An Industry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18261v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized software development, particularly by automating repetitive tasks and improving developer productivity. While these advancements are well-documented, the use of AI-powered tools for Software Vulnerability Management (SVM), such as vulnerability detection and repair, remains underexplored in industry settings. To bridge this gap, our study aims to determine the extent of the adoption of AI-powered tools for SVM, identify barriers and facilitators to the use, and gather insights to help improve the tools to meet industry needs better. We conducted a survey study involving 60 practitioners from diverse industry sectors across 27 countries. The survey incorporates both quantitative and qualitative questions to analyze the adoption trends, assess tool strengths, identify practical challenges, and uncover opportunities for improvement. Our findings indicate that AI-powered tools are used throughout the SVM life cycle, with 69% of users reporting satisfaction with their current use. Practitioners value these tools for their speed, coverage, and accessibility. However, concerns about false positives, missing context, and trust issues remain prevalent. We observe a socio-technical adoption pattern in which AI outputs are filtered through human oversight and organizational governance. To support safe and effective use of AI for SVM, we recommend improvements in explainability, contextual awareness, integration workflows, and validation practices. We assert that these findings can offer practical guidance for practitioners, tool developers, and researchers seeking to enhance secure software development through the use of AI.</description>

      <title>MORPHEUS: A Multidimensional Framework for Modeling, Measuring, and Mitigating Human Factors in Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cybersecurity research increasingly acknowledges the human factor, yet remains fragmented, often treating user vulnerabilities as isolated and static traits. This paper introduces MORPHEUS, a holistic framework that operationalizes human-centric security as a dynamic and interconnected system. Grounded in the Cognition-Affect-Behavior (CAB) model and Attribution Theory, MORPHEUS consolidates 50 human factors influencing susceptibility to major cyberthreats, including phishing, malware, password management, and misconfigurations. Beyond factor identification, the framework systematically maps 295 documented interactions, revealing how cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and socio-organizational processes jointly shape security outcomes, and distills them into twelve recurring interaction mechanisms. MORPHEUS further links theory to practice through an inventory of 99 validated psychometric instruments, enabling empirical assessment and targeted intervention. We illustrate the framework's applicability through concrete operational scenarios, spanning risk diagnosis, training, and interface design. Overall, MORPHEUS provides a rigorous yet actionable foundation for advancing human-centered cybersecurity research and practice.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Visual Data Wrangling via Direct Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data wrangling - the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis - is a well-known bottleneck in data science workflows. Existing tools either rely on manual scripting, which is error-prone and hard to debug, or automate cleaning through opaque black-box pipelines that offer limited control. We present Buckaroo, a scalable visual data wrangling system that restructures data preparation as a direct manipulation task over visualizations. Buckaroo enables users to explore and repair data anomalies - such as missing values, outliers, and type mismatches - by interacting directly with coordinated data visualizations. The system extensibly supports user-defined error detectors and wranglers, tracks provenance for undo/redo, and generates reproducible scripts for downstream tasks. Buckaroo maintains efficient indexing data structures and differential storage to localize anomaly detection and minimize recomputation. To demonstrate the applicability of our model, Buckaroo is integrated with the \textit{Hopara} pan-and-zoom engine, which enables multi-layered navigation over large datasets without sacrificing interactivity. Through empirical evaluation and an expert review, we show that Buckaroo makes visual data wrangling scalable - bridging the gap between visual inspection and programmable repairs.</description>

      <title>When Robots Say No: The Empathic Ethical Disobedience Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots must balance compliance with safety and social expectations as blind obedience can cause harm, while over-refusal erodes trust. Existing safe reinforcement learning (RL) benchmarks emphasize physical hazards, while human-robot interaction trust studies are small-scale and hard to reproduce. We present the Empathic Ethical Disobedience (EED) Gym, a standardized testbed that jointly evaluates refusal safety and social acceptability. Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust. At submission time, we include an anonymized reproducibility package with code and configs, and we commit to open-sourcing the full repository after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>From Scratch to Fine-Tuned: A Comparative Study of Transformer Training Strategies for Legal Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multilingual nations like India, access to legal information is often hindered by language barriers, as much of the legal and judicial documentation remains in English. Legal Machine Translation (L-MT) offers a scalable solution to this challenge by enabling accurate and accessible translations of legal documents. This paper presents our work for the JUST-NLP 2025 Legal MT shared task, focusing on English-Hindi translation using Transformer-based approaches. We experiment with 2 complementary strategies, fine-tuning a pre-trained OPUS-MT model for domain-specific adaptation and training a Transformer model from scratch using the provided legal corpus. Performance is evaluated using standard MT metrics, including SacreBLEU, chrF++, TER, ROUGE, BERTScore, METEOR, and COMET. Our fine-tuned OPUS-MT model achieves a SacreBLEU score of 46.03, significantly outperforming both baseline and from-scratch models. The results highlight the effectiveness of domain adaptation in enhancing translation quality and demonstrate the potential of L-MT systems to improve access to justice and legal transparency in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Text2SQL Framework using Small Language Models and Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text2SQL, the task of generating SQL queries from natural language text, is a critical challenge in data engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance for this task due to their advanced comprehension and generation capabilities. However, privacy and cost considerations prevent companies from using Text2SQL solutions based on external LLMs offered as a service. Rather, small LLMs (SLMs) that are openly available and can hosted in-house are adopted. These SLMs, in turn, lack the generalization capabilities of larger LLMs, which impairs their effectiveness for complex tasks such as Text2SQL. To address these limitations, we propose MATS, a novel Text2SQL framework designed specifically for SLMs. MATS uses a multi-agent mechanism that assigns specialized roles to auxiliary agents, reducing individual workloads and fostering interaction. A training scheme based on reinforcement learning aligns these agents using feedback obtained during execution, thereby maintaining competitive performance despite a limited LLM size. Evaluation results using on benchmark datasets show that MATS, deployed on a single- GPU server, yields accuracy that are on-par with large-scale LLMs when using significantly fewer parameters. Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/thanhdath/mats-sql.</description>

      <title>"Even GPT Can Reject Me": Conceptualizing Abrupt Refusal Secondary Harm (ARSH) and Reimagining Psychological AI Safety with Compassionate Completion Standard (CCS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI chatbots are increasingly used for emotional and mental health support due to their low cost, immediacy, and accessibility. However, when safety guardrails are triggered, conversations may be abruptly terminated, introducing a distinct form of emotional disruption that can exacerbate distress and elevate risk among already vulnerable users. As this phenomenon gains attention, this viewpoint introduces Abrupt Refusal Secondary Harm (ARSH) as a conceptual framework to describe the psychological impacts of sudden conversational discontinuation caused by AI safety protocols. Drawing on counseling psychology and communication science as conceptual heuristics, we argue that abrupt refusals can rupture perceived relational continuity, evoke feelings of rejection or shame, and discourage future help seeking. To mitigate these risks, we propose a design hypothesis, the Compassionate Completion Standard (CCS), a refusal protocol grounded in Human Centered Design (HCD) that maintains safety constraints while preserving relational coherence. CCS emphasizes empathetic acknowledgment, transparent boundary articulation, graded conversational transition, and guided redirection, replacing abrupt disengagement with psychologically attuned closure. By integrating awareness of ARSH into AI safety design, developers and policymakers can reduce preventable iatrogenic harm and advance a more psychologically informed approach to AI governance. Rather than presenting incremental empirical findings, this viewpoint contributes a timely conceptual framework, articulates a testable design hypothesis, and outlines a coordinated research agenda for improving psychological safety in human AI interaction.</description>

      <title>VizDefender: Unmasking Visualization Tampering through Proactive Localization and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrity of data visualizations is increasingly threatened by image editing techniques that enable subtle yet deceptive tampering. Through a formative study, we define this challenge and categorize tampering techniques into two primary types: data manipulation and visual encoding manipulation. To address this, we present VizDefender, a framework for tampering detection and analysis. The framework integrates two core components: 1) a semi-fragile watermark module that protects the visualization by embedding a location map to images, which allows for the precise localization of tampered regions while preserving visual quality, and 2) an intent analysis module that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret manipulation, inferring the attacker's intent and misleading effects. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Psychometric Validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale and a New Understanding of the Development of GenAI Mastery: Lessons from 3,932 Adult Brazilian Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18871v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid diffusion of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems has introduced new forms of human-technology interaction, raising the question of whether sustained engagement gives rise to stable, internalized modes of cognition rather than merely transient efficiency gains. Grounded in the Cognitive Mediation Networks Theory, this study investigates Sophotechnic Mediation, a mode of thinking and acting associated with prolonged interaction with GenAI, and presents a comprehensive psychometric validation of the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale. Data were collected between 2023 and 2025 from independent cross-sectional samples totaling 3,932 adult workers from public and private organizations in the Metropolitan Region of Pernambuco, Brazil. Results indicate excellent internal consistency, a robust unidimensional structure, and measurement invariance across cohorts. Ordinal-robust confirmatory factor analyses and residual diagnostics show that elevated absolute fit indices reflect minor local dependencies rather than incorrect dimensionality. Distributional analyses reveal a time-evolving pattern characterized by a declining mass of non-adopters and convergence toward approximate Gaussianity among adopters, with model comparisons favoring a two-process hurdle model over a censored Gaussian specification. Sophotechnic Mediation is empirically distinct from Hypercultural mediation and is primarily driven by cumulative GenAI experience, with age moderating the rate of initial acquisition and the depth of later integration. Together, the findings support Sophotechnia as a coherent, measurable, and emergent mode of cognitive mediation associated with the ongoing GenAI revolution.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Developer-Provided Context for AI Coding Assistants in Open-Source Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied.
  This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.</description>

      <title>Epistemological Fault Lines Between Human and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely described as artificial intelligence, yet their epistemic profile diverges sharply from human cognition. Here we show that the apparent alignment between human and machine outputs conceals a deeper structural mismatch in how judgments are produced. Tracing the historical shift from symbolic AI and information filtering systems to large-scale generative transformers, we argue that LLMs are not epistemic agents but stochastic pattern-completion systems, formally describable as walks on high-dimensional graphs of linguistic transitions rather than as systems that form beliefs or models of the world. By systematically mapping human and artificial epistemic pipelines, we identify seven epistemic fault lines, divergences in grounding, parsing, experience, motivation, causal reasoning, metacognition, and value. We call the resulting condition Epistemia: a structural situation in which linguistic plausibility substitutes for epistemic evaluation, producing the feeling of knowing without the labor of judgment. We conclude by outlining consequences for evaluation, governance, and epistemic literacy in societies increasingly organized around generative AI.</description>

      <title>More code, less validation: Risk factors for over-reliance on AI coding tools among scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming is essential to modern scientific research, yet most scientists report inadequate training for the software development their work demands. Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.</description>

      <title>What Human-Horse Interactions may Teach us About Effective Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores human-horse interactions as a metaphor for understanding and designing effective human-AI partnerships. Drawing on the long history of human collaboration with horses, we propose that AI, like horses, should complement rather than replace human capabilities. We move beyond traditional benchmarks such as the Turing test, which emphasize AI's ability to mimic human intelligence, and instead advocate for a symbiotic relationship where distinct intelligences enhance each other. We analyze key elements of human-horse relationships: trust, communication, and mutual adaptability, to highlight essential principles for human-AI collaboration. Trust is critical in both partnerships, built through predictability and shared understanding, while communication and feedback loops foster mutual adaptability. We further discuss the importance of taming and habituation in shaping these interactions, likening it to how humans train AI to perform reliably and ethically in real-world settings. The article also addresses the asymmetry of responsibility, where humans ultimately bear the greater burden of oversight and ethical judgment. Finally, we emphasize that long-term commitment and continuous learning are vital in both human-horse and human-AI relationships, as ongoing interaction refines the partnership and increases mutual adaptability. By drawing on these insights from human-horse interactions, we offer a vision for designing AI systems that are trustworthy, adaptable, and capable of fostering symbiotic human-AI partnerships.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Default Images in Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: In the creative practice of text-to-image (TTI) generation, images are synthesized from textual prompts. By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of over 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Mirroring Users: Towards Building Preference-aligned User Simulator with User Feedback in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User simulation is increasingly vital to develop and evaluate recommender systems (RSs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues to simulate user behavior, they often struggle with the absence of specific task alignment required for RSs and the efficiency demands of large-scale simulation. A vast yet underutilized resource for enhancing this alignment is the extensive user feedback inherent in RSs, but leveraging it is challenging due to its ambiguity, noise and massive volume, which hinders efficient preference alignment. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel data construction framework that leverages user feedback in RSs with advanced LLM capabilities to generate high-quality simulation data. Our framework unfolds in two key phases: (1) using LLMs to generate decision-making processes as explanatory rationales on simulation samples, thereby reducing ambiguity; and (2) data distillation based on uncertainty estimation and behavior sampling to efficiently filter the most informative, denoised samples. Accordingly, we fine-tune lightweight LLMs, as user simulators, using such high-quality dataset with corresponding decision-making processes. Extensive experiments confirm that our framework significantly boosts the alignment with human preferences and the in-domain reasoning capabilities of the fine-tuned LLMs, providing more insightful and interpretable signals for RS interaction. We believe our work, together with publicly available developed framework, high-quality mixed-domain dataset, and fine-tuned LLM checkpoints, will advance the RS community and offer valuable insights for broader human-centric AI research.</description>

      <title>Defining a Role-Centered Terminology for Physical Representations and Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous classifications advanced research through a better understanding of the field and the variety of tangible user interfaces and related physical user interfaces, especially by discretizing a degree of tangibility based on the specimens produced by the community over the years, since the conceptualization of Tangible User Interface initiated a research effort to deepen the exploration of the concept. However, no taxonomy enables the classification of tangible user interfaces at the application level. This article proposes to refine the description of tangible user interfaces' interactional components through a terminological approach. The resulting terms are blended words, built from known words, that self-contain what digital role is represented or controlled and how it becomes physical. This holistic terminology then enables the definition of applications' hallmarks and four classes of tangibility for applications, which surpass the description of physical user interface specimens' morphology by abstracting and discriminating specimens at the applicative level. The descriptiveness and holisticness of the new terminology, as well as the clustering and discriminative power of the limited number of four classes, are showed on a corpus of applicative tangible user interfaces' specimens from the literature. Promising future work will benefit from the holistic terminology, the applications' hallmarks, and the tangibility classes, to describe applicative tangible user interfaces and related physical user interfaces to better understand the dozens of specimens that were produced by the field over three decades. Indeed, describing and classifying this whole set would deepen our understanding to provide tools for future developers and designers.</description>

      <title>Imagining and building wise machines: The centrality of AI metacognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although AI has become increasingly smart, its wisdom has not kept pace. In this article, we examine what is known about human wisdom and sketch a vision of its AI counterpart. We analyze human wisdom as a set of strategies for solving intractable problems-those outside the scope of analytic techniques-including both object-level strategies like heuristics [for managing problems] and metacognitive strategies like intellectual humility, perspective-taking, or context-adaptability [for managing object-level strategies]. We argue that AI systems particularly struggle with metacognition; improved metacognition would lead to AI more robust to novel environments, explainable to users, cooperative with others, and safer in risking fewer misaligned goals with human users. We discuss how wise AI might be benchmarked, trained, and implemented.</description>

      <title>"Your Doctor is Spying on You": An Analysis of Data Practices in Mobile Healthcare Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile healthcare (mHealth) applications promise convenient, continuous patient-provider interaction but also introduce severe and often underexamined security and privacy risks. We present an end-to-end audit of 272 Android mHealth apps from Google Play, combining permission forensics, static vulnerability analysis, and user review mining. Our multi-tool assessment with MobSF, RiskInDroid, and OWASP Mobile Audit revealed systemic weaknesses: 26.1% request fine-grained location without disclosure, 18.3% initiate calls silently, and 73 send SMS without notice. Nearly half (49.3%) still use deprecated SHA-1 encryption, 42 transmit unencrypted data, and 6 remain vulnerable to StrandHogg 2.0. Analysis of 2.56 million user reviews found 28.5% negative or neutral sentiment, with over 553,000 explicitly citing privacy intrusions, data misuse, or operational instability. These findings demonstrate the urgent need for enforceable permission transparency, automated pre-market security vetting, and systematic adoption of secure-by-design practices to protect Protected Health Information (PHI).</description>

      <title>FreeAskWorld: An Interactive and Closed-Loop Simulator for Human-Centric Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks. To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</description>

      <title>Can AI Understand What We Cannot Say? Measuring Multilevel Alignment Through Abortion Stigma Across Cognitive, Interpersonal, and Structural Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (worries about judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.</description>
