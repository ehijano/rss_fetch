      <title>Influence of Photoemission Geometry on Timing and Efficiency in 4D Ultrafast Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broader adoption of 4D ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) for the study of chemical, materials, and quantum systems is being driven by development of new instruments as well as continuous improvement and characterization of existing technologies. Perhaps owing to the still-high barrier to entry, the full range of capabilities of laser-driven 4D UEM instruments has yet to be established, particularly when operated at extremely low beam currents (~fA). Accordingly, with an eye on beam stability, we have conducted particle tracing simulations of unconventional off-axis photoemission geometries in a UEM equipped with a thermionic-emission gun. Specifically, we have explored the impact of experimentally adjustable parameters on the time-of-flight (TOF), the collection efficiency (CE), and the temporal width of ultrashort photoelectron packets. The adjustable parameters include the Wehnelt aperture diameter (DW), the cathode set-back position (Ztip), and the position of the femtosecond laser on the Wehnelt aperture surface relative to the optic axis (Rphoto). Notable findings include significant sensitivity of TOF to DW and Ztip, as well as non-intuitive responses of CE and temporal width to varying Rphoto. As a means to improve accessibility, practical implications and recommendations are emphasized wherever possible.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Acoustic Metalens with Tailored Structural Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to concentrate sound energy with a tunable focal point is essential for a wide range of acoustic applications, offering precise control over the location and intensity of sound pressure maxima. However, conventional acoustic metalenses are typically passive, with fixed focal positions, limiting their versatility. A significant obstacle in achieving tunable sound wave focusing lies in the complexity of precise and programmable adjustments, which often require intricate mechanical or electronic systems. In this study, we present a theoretical and experimental investigation of a reconfigurable acoustic metalens based on a bistable origami design. The metalens comprises eight flexible origami units, each capable of switching between two stable equilibrium states, enabling local modulation of sound waves through two distinct reflection phases. The metalens can be locked into specific symmetric or asymmetric configurations by manually tailoring the origami units to settle either of the two states. Each configuration generates a unique phase profile, focusing sound energy at a specific point. This concept allows the focal spot to be dynamically reconfigured both on and off-axis. Furthermore, the approach introduces a simple yet effective mechanism for tuning sound energy concentration, offering a solution for flexible acoustic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral-Gain in a Berry Dipole Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that non-equilibrium optical systems under static electric fields offer a pathway to realize chiral gain, where the non-Hermitian response of a material is controlled by the spin angular momentum of the wave. In this work, we uncover the topological nature of chiral gain and demonstrate how a static electric bias induces topological bandgaps that support unidirectional edge states at the material boundaries. Curiously, in our system, these topological edge states consistently exhibit dissipative properties. We further show that, by operating outside the topological gap, the chiral gain can be leveraged to engineer boundary-confined lasing modes with orbital angular momentum, locked to the orientation of the applied electric field. Our results open new possibilities for loss-compensated photonic waveguides, enabling advanced functionalities such as unidirectional, lossless edge-wave propagation and the generation of structured light with intrinsic orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Competing mechanisms of dominant radiative and Auger recombination in hot carrier generation in III-V semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional structures such as nanowires (NWs) show great promise in tailoring the rates of hot carrier thermalization in semiconductors with important implications for the design of efficient hot carrier absorbers. However, fabrication of high-quality, phase-pure crystal structures and control of their intrinsic electronic properties can be challenging, raising concerns about the role of competing radiative and non-radiative recombination mechanisms that govern hot carrier effects. Here, we elucidate the impact of crystal purity and altered electronic properties on the hot carrier properties by comparing two classes of III-V semiconductor NW arrays with similar band-gap energies and geometries, yet different crystal quality: one composed of GaAsSb NWs, free of planar stacking defects, and the other InGaAs NWs with a high density of stacking defects. Photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrates distinct hot carrier effects in both NW arrays; however, the InGaAs NWs with lower crystal quality exhibit stronger hot carrier effects, as evidenced by increased carrier temperature under identical photoabsorptivity. This difference arises from higher rates of Auger recombination in the InGaAs NWs due to their increased n-type conductivity, as confirmed by excitation power-dependent measurements. Our findings suggest that while enhancing material properties is crucial for improving the performance of hot carrier absorbers, optimizing conditions to increase the rates of Auger recombination will further boost the efficiency of these devices.</description>

      <title>A Composite Hydrogel of Porous Gold Nanorods and Gelatin: Nanoscale Structure and Rheo-Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating nanomaterials into hydrogels allows for the creation of versatile materials with properties that can be precisely tailored by manipulating their nanoscale structures, leading to a wide range of bulk properties. Investigating the structural and property characteristics of composite hydrogels is crucial in tailoring their performance for specific applications. This study focuses on investigating the correlation between the structural arrangement and properties of a composite hydrogel of thermoresponsive polymer, gelatin, and light-responsive antimicrobial porous gold nanorods, $PAuNR$. The rheo-mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are correlated with their nanoscale structural characteristics, investigated using small-angle neutron scattering ($SANS$). Analysis of $SANS$ data reveals a decrease in the fractal dimension of $PAuNRs$ incorporated hydrogel matrix, as compared to pure gelatin. Incorporating $PAuNRs$ results in formation of softer composite hydrogel as evident from decrease in viscoelastic moduli, critical yield strain, denaturation temperature and swelling ratio. Our results demonstrates that the structural modulation at the nanoscale can be precisely controlled through adjusting $PAuNRs$ concentration and temperature providing an fabrication mechanism for hydrogels with desired elastic properties. The reduced elasticity of the composite hydrogel and light sensitive/antimicrobial property of the $PAuNRs$ makes this system suitable for specific biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, device fabrication and stimuli based controlled drug delivery devices respectively.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase diagrams in micromagnetics with an eigenvalue solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to compute periodic phase diagram of micromagnetic systems by solving a periodic linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation using an eigenvalue solver with the Finite Element Method formalism. The linear operator in the eigenvalue problem is defined as a function of the periodic phase shift wave vector. The dispersion diagrams are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for complex eigen frequencies and corresponding eigen states for a range of prescribed wave vectors. The presented approach incorporates a calculation of the periodic effective field, including the exchange and magnetostatic field components. The approach is general in that it allows handling 3D problems with any 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities. The ability to calculated periodic diagrams provides insights into the spin wave propagation and localized resonances in complex micromagnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Transparent and Electrically Switchable Thin Film Tactile Actuators Based on Molecular Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most tactile actuators create tactile sensations through vibrations or the mechanical and electrochemical formation of bumps. However, tactile sensations of real objects arise from friction which is derived not only from physical topography, but also surface chemistry. Here, we show that molecular rearrangement can be leveraged to create new classes of tactile actuators based on the phases of liquid crystals embedded in a solid and transparent polymer film. We found that humans can feel differences by touch, especially between planar alignment and its disrupted phase, as actuated by a DC electrical field. In subjective terms, the sensation was described as a tacky to polished-like feeling. We attribute the mechanism of tactile contrast to microscale phase separation and changes in molecular orientation, as the nanoscale differences in topography are too small to be detected on their own by humans. This molecular rearrangement occurs quicker (&lt;17 ms) than actuation through ionic or fluid movement. This enables a new class of tactile actuators based on molecular orientation (TAMO) for haptic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Design of A Single Antenna With Tunable In-Band RCS Null Through Load Impedance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing the in-band and co-polarization radar cross section (RCS) of antennas has been a widely concerned problem. However, most of works focus on RCS reduction of antenna arrays, and there are few studies for a single antenna. Therefore, this letter presents a method to control the null of the in-band RCS by changing the load impedance of the antenna, so as to effectively reduce the RCS at particular directions. First, the relationship between the null position and the load impedance is calculated by analyzing the in-band scattering field of the antenna. Second, the load impedance of the traditional patch antenna is controlled by cascading an open-circuit stub of different lengths on the feeding line. Then, the null tunning of the in-band RCS is realized. Simulated and measured results show that the designed patch antenna can tune the null of in-band RCS from 0{\deg} to 60{\deg}. Thus, the in-band RCS is effectively reduced under the premise that the radiation performance is basically unchanged.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications, which are receiving increasing attention. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and in establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of the 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the total atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, becomes small enough to lead to band inversion with a re-opened gap, exhibiting nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Most importantly, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric nontrivial topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps, facilitating tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>
