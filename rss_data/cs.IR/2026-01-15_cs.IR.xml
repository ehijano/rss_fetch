      <title>Navigating Ideation Space: Decomposed Conceptual Representations for Positioning Scientific Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discovery is a cumulative process and requires new ideas to be situated within an ever-expanding landscape of existing knowledge. An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements, where our approach achieves Recall@30 of 0.329 (16.7% over baselines), our ideation transition retrieval reaches Hit Rate@30 of 0.643, and novelty assessment attains 0.37 correlation with expert judgments. In summary, our work provides a promising paradigm for future research on accelerating and evaluating scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Fine Grained Evaluation of LLMs-as-Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good deal of recent research has focused on how Large Language Models
  (LLMs) may be used as `judges' in place of humans to evaluate the quality
  of the output produced by various text / image processing systems. Within
  this broader context, a number of studies have investigated the specific
  question of how effectively LLMs can be used as relevance assessors for
  the standard ad hoc task in Information Retrieval (IR). We extend these
  studies by looking at additional questions. Most importantly, we use a
  Wikipedia based test collection created by the INEX initiative, and
  prompt LLMs to not only judge whether documents are relevant /
  non-relevant, but to highlight relevant passages in documents that it
  regards as useful. The human relevance assessors involved in creating
  this collection were given analogous instructions, i.e., they were asked
  to highlight all passages within a document that respond to the
  information need expressed in a query. This enables us to evaluate the
  quality of LLMs as judges not only at the document level, but to also
  quantify how often these `judges' are right for the right reasons.
  Our findings suggest that LLMs-as-judges work best under human
  supervision.</description>

      <title>LLMs Meet Isolation Kernel: Lightweight, Learning-free Binary Embeddings for Fast Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled remarkable progress in text representation. However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Why not Collaborative Filtering in Dual View? Bridging Sparse and Dense Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/harris26-G/SaD.</description>

      <title>On-Device Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device recommendation is critical for a number of real-world applications, especially in scenarios that have agreements on execution latency, user privacy, and robust functionality when internet connectivity is unstable or even impossible. While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.</description>

      <title>LISP -- A Rich Interaction Dataset and Loggable Interactive Search Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reusable dataset and accompanying infrastructure for studying human search behavior in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR). The dataset combines detailed interaction logs from 61 participants (122 sessions) with user characteristics, including perceptual speed, topic-specific interest, search expertise, and demographic information. To facilitate reproducibility and reuse, we provide a fully documented study setup, a web-based perceptual speed test, and a framework for conducting similar user studies. Our work allows researchers to investigate individual and contextual factors affecting search behavior, and to develop or validate user simulators that account for such variability. We illustrate the datasets potential through an illustrative analysis and release all resources as open-access, supporting reproducible research and resource sharing in the IIR community.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Judicial Reasoning in U.S. Copyright Damage Awards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judicial reasoning in copyright damage awards poses a core challenge for computational legal analysis. Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.</description>

      <title>Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09478v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.</description>

      <title>Unifying Search and Recommendation in LLMs via Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search and recommendation (S&amp;R) are core to online platforms, addressing explicit intent through queries and modeling implicit intent from behaviors, respectively. Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&amp;R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&amp;R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&amp;R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&amp;R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness.</description>

      <title>TEMPO: A Realistic Multi-Domain Benchmark for Temporal Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing temporal QA benchmarks focus on simple fact-seeking queries from news corpora, while reasoning-intensive retrieval benchmarks lack temporal grounding. However, real-world information needs often require reasoning about temporal evolution and synthesizing evidence across time periods. We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence. We believe TEMPO provides a challenging benchmark for improving temporal reasoning in retrieval and RAG systems. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tempo-bench/Tempo.

      <title>SpatCode: Rotary-based Unified Encoding Framework for Efficient Spatiotemporal Vector Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal vector retrieval has emerged as a critical paradigm in modern information retrieval, enabling efficient access to massive, heterogeneous data that evolve over both time and space. However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution. These results highlight the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach for scalable spatiotemporal information retrieval in intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Examining DOM Coordinate Effectiveness For Page Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web pages form a cornerstone of available data for daily human consumption and with the rise of LLM-based search and learning systems a treasure trove of valuable data. The scale of this data and its unstructured format still continue to grow requiring ever more robust automated extraction and retrieval mechanisms. Existing work, leveraging the web pages Document Object Model (DOM), often derives clustering vectors from coordinates informed by the DOM such as visual placement or tree structure. The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined. Finally, we find that if a vector, clustering algorithm, and page are properly matched, one can achieve overall high segmentation accuracy at 74%. This constitutes a 20% improvement over a naive application of vectors. Conclusively, our results challenge the current orthodoxy for segmentation vector creation, opens up the possibility to optimize page segmentation via clustering on DOM coordinates, and highlights the importance of finding mechanisms to match the best approach for web page segmentation.</description>

      <title>MM-BRIGHT: A Multi-Task Multimodal Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09562v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of text-based queries where keyword or semantic matching is usually sufficient. Many real-world queries contain multimodal elements, particularly, images such as diagrams, charts, and screenshots that require intensive reasoning to identify relevant documents. To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning.

      <title>OpenDecoder: Open Large Language Model Decoding to Incorporate Document Quality in RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved superior performance in a range of downstream tasks, including LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The quality of generated content heavily relies on the usefulness of the retrieved information and the capacity of LLMs' internal information processing mechanism to incorporate it in answer generation. It is generally assumed that the retrieved information is relevant to the question. However, the retrieved information may have a variable degree of relevance and usefulness, depending on the question and the document collection. It is important to take into account the relevance of the retrieved information in answer generation. In this paper, we propose OpenDecoder, a new approach that leverages explicit evaluation of the retrieved information as quality indicator features for generation. We aim to build a RAG model that is more robust to varying levels of noisy context. Three types of explicit evaluation information are considered: relevance score, ranking score, and QPP (query performance prediction) score. The experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and better robustness of OpenDecoder by outperforming various baseline methods. Importantly, this paradigm is flexible to be integrated with the post-training of LLMs for any purposes and incorporated with any type of external indicators.</description>

      <title>SpectraQuery: A Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Assistant for Battery Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific reasoning increasingly requires linking structured experimental data with the unstructured literature that explains it, yet most large language model (LLM) assistants cannot reason jointly across these modalities. We introduce SpectraQuery, a hybrid natural-language query framework that integrates a relational Raman spectroscopy database with a vector-indexed scientific literature corpus using a Structured and Unstructured Query Language (SUQL)-inspired design. By combining semantic parsing with retrieval-augmented generation, SpectraQuery translates open-ended questions into coordinated SQL and literature retrieval operations, producing cited answers that unify numerical evidence with mechanistic explanation. Across SQL correctness, answer groundedness, retrieval effectiveness, and expert evaluation, SpectraQuery demonstrates strong performance: approximately 80 percent of generated SQL queries are fully correct, synthesized answers reach 93-97 percent groundedness with 10-15 retrieved passages, and battery scientists rate responses highly across accuracy, relevance, grounding, and clarity (4.1-4.6/5). These results show that hybrid retrieval architectures can meaningfully support scientific workflows by bridging data and discourse for high-volume experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>StegoStylo: Squelching Stylometric Scrutiny through Steganographic Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.</description>

      <title>MMR-GRPO: Accelerating GRPO-Style Training through Diversity-Aware Reward Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has become a standard approach for training mathematical reasoning models; however, its reliance on multiple completions per prompt makes training computationally expensive. Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time. These gains are consistent across models, methods, and benchmarks. We will release our code, trained models, and experimental protocols.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into OpenStreetMap Research Since its Inception (2008-2024): Contributors, Topics, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) has transitioned from a pioneering volunteered geographic information (VGI) project into a global, multi-disciplinary research nexus. This study presents a bibliometric and systematic analysis of the OSM research landscape, examining its development trajectory and key driving forces. By evaluating 1,926 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection and 782 State of the Map (SotM) presentations up to June 2024, we quantify publication growth, collaboration patterns, and thematic evolution. Results demonstrate simultaneous consolidation and diversification within the field. While a stable core of contributors continues to anchor OSM research, themes have shifted from initial concerns over data production and quality toward advanced analytical and applied uses. Comparative analysis of OSM-related research in WoS and SotM reveals distinct but complementary agendas between scholars and the OSM community. Building on these findings, we identify six emerging research directions and discuss how evolving partnerships among academia, the OSM community, and industry are poised to shape the future of OSM research. This study establishes a structured reference for understanding the state of OSM studies and offers strategic pathways for navigating its future trajectory.The data and code are available at https://github.com/ya0-sun/OSMbib.</description>

      <title>Information Access of the Oppressed: A Problem-Posing Framework for Envisioning Emancipatory Information Access Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online information access (IA) platforms are targets of authoritarian capture. These concerns are particularly serious and urgent today in light of the rising levels of democratic erosion worldwide, the emerging capabilities of generative AI technologies such as AI persuasion, and the increasing concentration of economic and political power in the hands of Big Tech. This raises the question of what alternative IA infrastructure we must reimagine and build to mitigate the risks of authoritarian capture of our information ecosystems. We explore this question through the lens of Paulo Freire's theories of emancipatory pedagogy. Freire's theories provide a radically different lens for exploring IA's sociotechnical concerns relative to the current dominating frames of fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. We make explicit, with the intention to challenge, the dichotomy of how we relate to technology as either technologists (who envision and build technology) and its users. We posit that this mirrors the teacher-student relationship in Freire's analysis. By extending Freire's analysis to IA, we challenge the notion that it is the burden of the (altruistic) technologists to come up with interventions to mitigate the risks that emerging technologies pose to marginalized communities. Instead, we advocate that the first task for the technologists is to pose these as problems to the marginalized communities, to encourage them to make and unmake the technology as part of their material struggle against oppression. Their second task is to redesign our online technology stacks to structurally expose spaces for community members to co-opt and co-construct the technology in aid of their emancipatory struggles. We operationalize Freire's theories to develop a problem-posing framework for envisioning emancipatory IA platforms of the future.</description>

      <title>MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Memory-Efficient Distributed Algorithm for Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search with Arbitrary Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) search has become a central task in modern data-intensive applications, particularly when operating on large, heterogeneous, or high-dimensional datasets. However, many existing ANN methods struggle in such scenarios, either because they rely on metric assumptions or because their indexing strategies are not well suited to distributed environments or to settings with constrained memory resources.
  This work introduces PDASC (Parametrizable Distributed Approximate Similarity Search with Clustering), a distributed ANN search algorithm whose index design simultaneously supports arbitrary dissimilarity functions and efficient deployment in distributed, storage-aware environments. PDASC builds a distributed hierarchical index based on clustering mechanisms that are agnostic to distance properties, thereby accommodating non-metric and domain-specific similarities while naturally partitioning indexing and search across multiple computing nodes, with a compact per-node memory footprint. By preserving locally informative neighbourhood structure, the proposed index mitigates practical manifestations of the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. We analyse how the index structural parameters govern the trade-offs among recall, computational cost, and memory usage.
  Experimental evaluation across multiple benchmark datasets and distance functions shows that PDASC achieves competitive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs while consistently requiring lower per-node memory compared to state-of-the-art ANN methods. By avoiding reliance on specialised hardware acceleration, PDASC enables scalable and energy-efficient similarity search in heterogeneous and distributed settings where memory efficiency and distance-function flexibility are first-class constraints.</description>

      <title>Autofocus Retrieval: An Effective Pipeline for Multi-Hop Question Answering With Semi-Structured Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. Yet, most rely on either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking unstructured content to nodes within structured data. In this work, we present Autofocus-Retriever (AF-Retriever), a modular framework for SKB-based, multi-hop question answering. It combines structural and textual retrieval through novel integration steps and optimizations, achieving the best zero- and one-shot results across all three STaRK QA benchmarks, which span diverse domains and evaluation metrics.
  AF-Retriever's average first-hit rate surpasses the second-best method by 32.1%. Its performance is driven by (1) leveraging exchangeable large language models (LLMs) to extract entity attributes and relational constraints for both parsing and reranking the top-k answers, (2) vector similarity search for ranking both extracted entities and final answers, (3) a novel incremental scope expansion procedure that prepares for the reranking on a configurable amount of suitable candidates that fulfill the given constraints the most, and (4) a hybrid retrieval strategy that reduces error susceptibility.
  In summary, while constantly adjusting the focus like an optical autofocus, AF-Retriever delivers a configurable amount of answer candidates in four constraint-driven retrieval steps, which are then supplemented and ranked through four additional processing steps. An ablation study and a detailed error analysis, including a comparison of three different LLM reranking strategies, provide component-level insights.

      <title>Beyond Chunking: Discourse-Aware Hierarchical Retrieval for Long Document Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing long-document question answering systems typically process texts as flat sequences or use heuristic chunking, which overlook the discourse structures that naturally guide human comprehension. We present a discourse-aware hierarchical framework that leverages rhetorical structure theory (RST) for long document question answering. Our approach converts discourse trees into sentence-level representations and employs LLM-enhanced node representations to bridge structural and semantic information. The framework involves three key innovations: language-universal discourse parsing for lengthy documents, LLM-based enhancement of discourse relation nodes, and structure-guided hierarchical retrieval. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over existing approaches through the incorporation of discourse structure, across multiple genres and languages. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse document types and linguistic settings.</description>

      <title>KLAN: Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints. Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1) KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN, obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Human-vs-LLM judgments using the TREC Podcast Track</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to annotate relevance is an increasingly important technique in the information retrieval community. While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Late-interaction retrieval models like ColBERT achieve superior accuracy by enabling token-level interactions, but their computational cost hinders scalability and integration with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS). We introduce FastLane, a novel retrieval framework that dynamically routes queries to their most informative representations, eliminating redundant token comparisons. FastLane employs a learnable routing mechanism optimized alongside the embedding model, leveraging self-attention and differentiable selection to maximize efficiency. Our approach reduces computational complexity by up to 30x while maintaining competitive retrieval performance. By bridging late-interaction models with ANNS, FastLane enables scalable, low-latency retrieval, making it feasible for large-scale applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question-answering platforms. This work opens pathways for multi-lingual, multi-modal, and long-context retrieval, pushing the frontier of efficient and adaptive information retrieval.</description>

      <title>GAP-Net: Calibrating User Intent via Gated Adaptive Progressive Learning for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential user behavior modeling is pivotal for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction yet is hindered by three intrinsic bottlenecks: (1) the "Attention Sink" phenomenon, where standard Softmax compels the model to allocate probability mass to noisy behaviors; (2) the Static Query Assumption, which overlooks dynamic shifts in user intent driven by real-time contexts; and (3) Rigid View Aggregation, which fails to adaptively weight heterogeneous temporal signals according to the decision context. To bridge these gaps, we propose GAP-Net (Gated Adaptive Progressive Network), a unified framework establishing a "Triple Gating" architecture to progressively refine information from micro-level features to macro-level views. GAP-Net operates through three integrated mechanisms: (1) Adaptive Sparse-Gated Attention (ASGA) employs micro-level gating to enforce sparsity, effectively suppressing massive noise activations; (2) Gated Cascading Query Calibration (GCQC) dynamically aligns user intent by bridging real-time triggers and long-term memories via a meso-level cascading channel; and (3) Context-Gated Denoising Fusion (CGDF) performs macro-level modulation to orchestrate the aggregation of multi-view sequences. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that GAP-Net achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior robustness against interaction noise and intent drift.</description>

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this, existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable, and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs), adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and drive development of more capable RAG systems.</description>

      <title>The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.</description>

      <title>DiSCo: Making Absence Visible in Intelligent Summarization Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent interfaces increasingly use large language models to summarize user-generated content, yet these summaries emphasize what is mentioned while overlooking what is missing. This presence bias can mislead users who rely on summaries to make decisions. We present Domain Informed Summarization through Contrast (DiSCo), an expectation-based computational approach that makes absences visible by comparing each entity's content with domain topical expectations captured in reference distributions of aspects typically discussed in comparable accommodations. This comparison identifies aspects that are either unusually emphasized or missing relative to domain norms and integrates them into the generated text. In a user study across three accommodation domains, namely ski, beach, and city center, DiSCo summaries were rated as more detailed and useful for decision making than baseline large language model summaries, although slightly harder to read. The findings show that modeling expectations reduces presence bias and improves both transparency and decision support in intelligent summarization interfaces.</description>

      <title>Making Absence Visible: The Roles of Reference and Prompting in Recognizing Missing Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive systems that explain data, or support decision making often emphasize what is present while overlooking what is expected but missing. This presence bias limits users' ability to form complete mental models of a dataset or situation. Detecting absence depends on expectations about what should be there, yet interfaces rarely help users form such expectations. We present an experimental study examining how reference framing and prompting influence people's ability to recognize expected but missing categories in datasets. Participants compared distributions across three domains (energy, wealth, and regime) under two reference conditions: Global, presenting a unified population baseline, and Partial, showing several concrete exemplars. Results indicate that absence detection was higher with Partial reference than with Global reference, suggesting that partial, samples-based framing can support expectation formation and absence detection. When participants were prompted to look for what was missing, absence detection rose sharply. We discuss implications for interactive user interfaces and expectation-based visualization design, while considering cognitive trade-offs of reference structures and guided attention.</description>
