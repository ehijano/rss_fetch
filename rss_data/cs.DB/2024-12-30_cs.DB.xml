      <title>DIPS: Optimal Dynamic Index for Poisson $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ps Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Poisson $\pi$ps sampling problem, a topic of significant academic interest in various domains and with practical data mining applications, such as influence maximization. The problem includes a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $n$ elements, where each element $v$ is assigned a weight $w(v)$ reflecting its importance. The goal is to generate a random subset $X$ of $\mathcal{S}$, where each element $v \in \mathcal{S}$ is included in $X$ independently with probability $\frac{c\cdot w(v)}{\sum_{v \in \mathcal{S}} w(v)}$, where $0&lt;c\leq 1$ is a constant. The subsets must be independent across different queries. While the Poisson $\pi$ps sampling problem can be reduced to the well-studied subset sampling problem, updates in Poisson $\pi$ps sampling, such as adding a new element or removing an element, would cause the probabilities of all $n$ elements to change in the corresponding subset sampling problem, making this approach impractical for dynamic scenarios. To address this, we propose a dynamic index specifically tailored for the Poisson $\pi$ps sampling problem, supporting optimal expected $\mathcal{O}(1)$ query time and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ index update time, with an optimal $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space cost. Our solution involves recursively partitioning the set by weights and ultimately using table lookup. The core of our solution lies in addressing the challenges posed by weight explosion and correlations between elements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves significant speedups in update time while maintaining consistently competitive query time compared to the subset-sampling-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Logic Approach to Efficient Frequent Itemset Discovery in Large Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequent itemset mining algorithm based on the Boolean matrix method, aiming to solve the storage and computational bottlenecks of traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms in high-dimensional and large-scale transaction databases. By representing the itemsets in the transaction database as Boolean matrices, the algorithm uses Boolean logic operations such as AND and OR to efficiently calculate the support of the itemsets, avoiding the generation and storage of a large number of candidates itemsets in traditional algorithms. The algorithm recursively mines frequent itemsets through matrix operations and can flexibly adapt to different data scales and support thresholds. In the experiment, the public Groceries dataset was selected, and the running efficiency test and frequent itemset mining effect test were designed to evaluate the algorithm's performance indicators such as running time, memory usage, and number of frequent itemsets under different transaction numbers and support thresholds. The experimental results show that the algorithm can efficiently mine a large number of frequent itemsets when the support threshold is low, and focus on strong association rules with high support when the threshold is high. In addition, the changing trends of running time and memory usage show that the Boolean matrix method can still maintain good running efficiency when the number of transactions increases significantly and has high scalability and robustness. Future research can improve memory optimization and matrix block operations, and combine distributed computing and deep learning models to further enhance the algorithm's applicability and real-time processing capabilities in ultra-large-scale data environments. The algorithm has broad application potential and development prospects in the fields of market analysis, recommendation systems, and network security.</description>

      <title>CypherBench: Towards Precise Retrieval over Full-scale Modern Knowledge Graphs in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>SketchFill: Sketch-Guided Code Generation for Imputing Derived Missing Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing value is a critical issue in data science, significantly impacting the reliability of analyses and predictions. Missing value imputation (MVI) is a longstanding problem because it highly relies on domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for data cleaning, including MVI for tabular data, offering advanced capabilities for understanding and generating content. However, despite their promise, existing LLM techniques such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often fall short in guiding LLMs to perform complex reasoning for MVI, particularly when imputing derived missing values, which require mathematical formulas and data relationships across rows and columns. This gap underscores the need for further advancements in LLM methodologies to enhance their reasoning capabilities for more reliable imputation outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose SketchFill, a novel sketch-based method to guide LLMs in generating accurate formulas to impute missing numerical values. Our experimental results demonstrate that SketchFill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 56.2% higher accuracy than CoT-based methods and 78.8% higher accuracy than MetaGPT. This sets a new standard for automated data cleaning and advances the field of MVI for numerical values.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.</description>

      <title>OmniPred: Language Models as Universal Regressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14547v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regression is a powerful tool to accurately predict the outcome metric of a system given a set of parameters, but has traditionally been restricted to methods which are only applicable to a specific task. In this paper, we propose OmniPred, a framework for training language models as universal end-to-end regressors over $(x,y)$ data from arbitrary formats. Using data sourced from Google Vizier, one of the largest proprietary blackbox optimization databases in the world, our extensive experiments demonstrate that language models are capable of very precise numerical regression using only textual representations of mathematical parameters and values, and if given the opportunity to train at scale over multiple tasks, can significantly outperform traditional regression models.</description>

      <title>From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</description>
