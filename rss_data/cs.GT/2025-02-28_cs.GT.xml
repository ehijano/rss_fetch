      <title>Stable Matching under Matroid Rank Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-sided matching model where one side of the market (hospitals) has combinatorial preferences over the other side (doctors). Specifically, we consider the setting where hospitals have matroid rank valuations over the doctors, and doctors have either ordinal or cardinal unit-demand valuations over the hospitals. While this setting has been extensively studied in the context of one-sided markets, it remains unexplored in the context of two-sided markets.
  When doctors have ordinal preferences over hospitals, we present simple sequential allocation algorithms that guarantee stability, strategyproofness for doctors, and approximate strategyproofness for hospitals. When doctors have cardinal utilities over hospitals, we present an algorithm that finds a stable allocation maximizing doctor welfare; subject to that, we show how one can maximize either the hospital utilitarian or hospital Nash welfare. Moreover, we show that it is NP-hard to compute stable allocations that approximately maximize hospital Nash welfare.</description>

      <title>Participation Incentives in Online Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies cooperative games where coalitions are formed online and the value generated by the grand coalition must be irrevocably distributed among the players at each timestep. We investigate the fundamental issue of strategic pariticipation incentives and address these concerns by formalizing natural participation incentive axioms. Our analysis reveals that existing value-sharing mechanisms fail to meet these criteria. Consequently, we propose several new mechanisms that not only fulfill these desirable participation incentive axioms but also satisfy the early arrival incentive for general valuation functions. Additionally, we refine our mechanisms under superadditive valuations to ensure individual rationality while preserving the previously established axioms.</description>

      <title>On the Welfare of EIP-1559 with Patient Bidders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``EIP-1599 algorithm'' is used by the Ethereum blockchain to assemble transactions into blocks. While prior work has studied it under the assumption that bidders are ``impatient'', we analyze it under the assumption that bidders are ``patient'', which better corresponds to the fact that unscheduled transactions remain in the mempool and can be scheduled at a later time. We show that with ``patient'' bidders, this algorithm produces schedules of near-optimal welfare, provided it is given a mild resource augmentation (that does not increase with the time horizon). We prove some generalizations of the basic theorem, establish lower bounds that rule out several candidate improvements and extensions, and propose several questions for future work.</description>

      <title>Hiring under Congestion and Algorithmic Monoculture: Value of Strategic Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of strategic behavior in a setting where firms compete to hire from a shared pool of applicants, and firms use a common algorithm to evaluate them. Each applicant is associated with a scalar score that is observed by all firms, provided by the algorithm. Firms simultaneously make interview decisions, where the number of interviews is capacity-constrained. Job offers are given to those who pass the interview, and an applicant who receives multiple offers accepts one of them uniformly at random. We fully characterize the set of Nash equilibria under this model. Defining social welfare as the total number of applicants who find a job, we then compare the social welfare at a Nash equilibrium to a naive baseline where all firms interview applicants with the highest scores. We show that the Nash equilibrium greatly improves upon social welfare compared to the naive baseline, especially when the interview capacity is small and the number of firms is large. We also show that the price of anarchy is small, providing further appeal for the equilibrium solution.
  We then study how the firms may converge to a Nash equilibrium. We show that when firms make interview decisions sequentially and each firm takes the best response action assuming they are the last to act, this process converges to an equilibrium when interview capacities are small. However, we show that the task of computing the best response is difficult if firms have to use its own historical samples to estimate it, while this task becomes trivial if firms have information on the degree of competition for each applicant. Therefore, converging to an equilibrium can be greatly facilitated if firms have information on the level of competition for each applicant.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating Open-ended Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation has traditionally focused on ranking candidates for a specific skill. Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</description>

      <title>Swap Regret and Correlated Equilibria Beyond Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swap regret is a notion that has proven itself to be central to the study of general-sum normal-form games, with swap-regret minimization leading to convergence to the set of correlated equilibria and guaranteeing non-manipulability against a self-interested opponent. However, the situation for more general classes of games -- such as Bayesian games and extensive-form games -- is less clear-cut, with multiple candidate definitions for swap-regret but no known efficiently minimizable variant of swap regret that implies analogous non-manipulability guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a new variant of swap regret for polytope games that we call ``profile swap regret'', with the property that obtaining sublinear profile swap regret is both necessary and sufficient for any learning algorithm to be non-manipulable by an opponent (resolving an open problem of Mansour et al., 2022). Although we show profile swap regret is NP-hard to compute given a transcript of play, we show it is nonetheless possible to design efficient learning algorithms that guarantee at most $O(\sqrt{T})$ profile swap regret. Finally, we explore the correlated equilibrium notion induced by low-profile-swap-regret play, and demonstrate a gap between the set of outcomes that can be implemented by this learning process and the set of outcomes that can be implemented by a third-party mediator (in contrast to the situation in normal-form games).</description>

      <title>Economic Censorship Games in Fraud Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimistic rollups rely on fraud proofs -- interactive protocols executed on Ethereum to resolve conflicting claims about the rollup's state -- to scale Ethereum securely.
  To mitigate against potential censorship of protocol moves, fraud proofs grant participants a significant time window, known as the challenge period, to ensure their moves are processed on chain. Major optimistic rollups today set this period at roughly one week, mainly to guard against strong censorship that undermines Ethereum's own crypto-economic security. However, other forms of censorship are possible, and their implication on optimistic rollup security is not well understood.
  This paper considers economic censorship attacks, where an attacker censors the defender's transactions by bribing block proposers. At each step, the attacker can either censor the defender -- depleting the defender's time allowance at the cost of the bribe -- or allow the current transaction through while conserving funds for future censorship.
  We analyze three game theoretic models of these dynamics and determine the challenge period length required to ensure the defender's success, as a function of the number of required protocol moves and the players' available budgets.</description>

      <title>Equilibria and Learning in Modular Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We envision a marketplace where diverse entities offer specialized "modules" through APIs, allowing users to compose the outputs of these modules for complex tasks within a given budget. This paper studies the market design problem in such an ecosystem, where module owners strategically set prices for their APIs (to maximize their profit) and a central platform orchestrates the aggregation of module outputs at query-time. One can also think about this as a first-price procurement auction with budgets. The first observation is that if the platform's algorithm is to find the optimal set of modules then this could result in a poor outcome, in the sense that there are price equilibria which provide arbitrarily low value for the user. We show that under a suitable version of the "bang-per-buck" algorithm for the knapsack problem, an $\varepsilon$-approximate equilibrium always exists, for any arbitrary $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Further, our first main result shows that with this algorithm any such equilibrium provides a constant approximation to the optimal value that the buyer could get under various constraints including (i) a budget constraint and (ii) a budget and a matroid constraint. Finally, we demonstrate that these efficient equilibria can be learned through decentralized price adjustments by module owners using no-regret learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Selfish mining under general stochastic rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selfish mining, a strategy where Proof-of-Work consensus participants selectively withhold blocks, allows miners to earn disproportionately high revenue. The vast majority of the selfish mining literature focuses exclusively on block rewards. Carlsten et al. [2016] is a notable exception, which observes that similar strategic behavior may be profitable in a zero-block-reward regime if miners are compensated with transaction fees alone. As of February 2025, neither model fully captures miner incentives. The block reward remains 3.125 BTC, yet some blocks yield significantly higher revenue. For example, congestion during the launch of the Babylon protocol in August 2024 caused transaction fees to spike from 0.14 BTC to 9.52 BTC, a $68\times$ increase in fee rewards within two blocks. We present a framework for considering strategic behavior under more general miner reward functions that could be stochastic, variable in time, and/or ephemeral. This model can capture many existing reward sources (sometimes called Miner/Maximal Extractable Value or MEV) in blockchains today. We use our framework to examine the profitability of cutoff selfish mining strategies for any reward function identically distributed across forks. Our analysis requires a novel reward calculation technique to capture non-linearity in general rewards. We instantiate these results in a combined reward function that much more accurately represents miner incentives as they exist in Bitcoin today. This reward function includes block rewards and linear-in-time transaction fees, which have been studied in isolation. It also introduces a third random reward motivated by the aforementioned transaction fee spike. This instantiation enables us to (i) make qualitative observations, (ii) make quantitative claims, and (iii) confirm the theoretical analysis using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Cued to Queue: Information in Waiting-Line Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. When agents have quasi-linear utility in time spent waiting, they choose entry times as they would bids in a descending auction. An information designer can influence their behavior by providing updates about the length of the queue. Many natural information policies release "sudden bad news," which occurs when agents learn that the queue is longer than previously believed. We show that sudden bad news can cause assortative inefficiency by prompting a mass of agents to simultaneously attempt to join the queue. As a result, if the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. When agents face entry costs to join the queue and the value distribution has a decreasing hazard rate, an information designer maximizes total surplus by announcing only when the queue is full.</description>

      <title>Constrained Serial Dictatorships can be Fair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When allocating indivisible items to agents, it is known that the only strategyproof mechanisms that satisfy a set of rather mild conditions are constrained serial dictatorships: given a fixed order over agents, at each step the designated agent chooses a given number of items (depending on her position in the sequence). Agents who come earlier in the sequence have a larger choice of items; however, this advantage can be compensated by a higher number of items received by those who come later. How to balance priority in the sequence and number of items received is a nontrivial question. We use a previous model, parameterized by a mapping from ranks to scores, a social welfare functional, and a distribution over preference profiles. For several meaningful choices of parameters, we show that the optimal sequence can be computed exactly in polynomial time or approximated using sampling. Our results hold for several probabilistic models on preference profiles, with an emphasis on the Plackett-Luce model. We conclude with experimental results showing how the optimal sequence is impacted by various parameters.</description>

      <title>Strategic Classification With Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new variant of the strategic classification problem: a principal reveals a classifier, and $n$ agents report their (possibly manipulated) features to be classified. Motivated by real-world applications, our model crucially allows the manipulation of one agent to affect another; that is, it explicitly captures inter-agent externalities. The principal-agent interactions are formally modeled as a Stackelberg game, with the resulting agent manipulation dynamics captured as a simultaneous game. We show that under certain assumptions, the pure Nash Equilibrium of this agent manipulation game is unique and can be efficiently computed. Leveraging this result, PAC learning guarantees are established for the learner: informally, we show that it is possible to learn classifiers that minimize loss on the distribution, even when a random number of agents are manipulating their way to a pure Nash Equilibrium. We also comment on the optimization of such classifiers through gradient-based approaches. This work sets the theoretical foundations for a more realistic analysis of classifiers that are robust against multiple strategic actors interacting in a common environment.</description>
