      <title>Entry-Wise Eigenvector Analysis and Improved Rates for Topic Modeling on Short Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic modeling is a widely utilized tool in text analysis. We investigate the optimal rate for estimating a topic model. Specifically, we consider a scenario with $n$ documents, a vocabulary of size $p$, and document lengths at the order $N$. When $N\geq c\cdot p$, referred to as the long-document case, the optimal rate is established in the literature at $\sqrt{p/(Nn)}$. However, when $N=o(p)$, referred to as the short-document case, the optimal rate remains unknown. In this paper, we first provide new entry-wise large-deviation bounds for the empirical singular vectors of a topic model. We then apply these bounds to improve the error rate of a spectral algorithm, Topic-SCORE. Finally, by comparing the improved error rate with the minimax lower bound, we conclude that the optimal rate is still $\sqrt{p/(Nn)}$ in the short-document case.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Step-Size Assumptions in Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many machine learning and optimization algorithms are built upon the framework of stochastic approximation (SA), for which the selection of step-size (or learning rate) is essential for success. For the sake of clarity, this paper focuses on the special case $\alpha_n = \alpha_0 n^{-\rho}$ at iteration $n$, with $\rho \in [0,1]$ and $\alpha_0&gt;0$ design parameters. It is most common in practice to take $\rho=0$ (constant step-size), while in more theoretically oriented papers a vanishing step-size is preferred. In particular, with $\rho \in (1/2, 1)$ it is known that on applying the averaging technique of Polyak and Ruppert, the mean-squared error (MSE) converges at the optimal rate of $O(1/n)$ and the covariance in the central limit theorem (CLT) is minimal in a precise sense.
  The paper revisits step-size selection in a general Markovian setting. Under readily verifiable assumptions, the following conclusions are obtained provided $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$:
  $\bullet$ Parameter estimates converge with probability one, and also in $L_p$ for any $p\ge 1$.
  $\bullet$ The MSE may converge very slowly for small $\rho$, of order $O(\alpha_n^2)$ even with averaging.
  $\bullet$ For linear stochastic approximation the source of slow convergence is identified: for any $\rho\in (0,1)$, averaging results in estimates for which the error $\textit{covariance}$ vanishes at the optimal rate, and moreover the
  CLT covariance is optimal in the sense of Polyak and Ruppert. However, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained under which the $\textit{bias}$ converges to zero at rate $O(\alpha_n)$.
  This is the first paper to obtain such strong conclusions while allowing for $\rho \le 1/2$. A major conclusion is that the choice of $\rho =0$ or even $\rho&lt;1/2$ is justified only in select settings -- In general, bias may preclude fast convergence.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation : Beyond Plug-in Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) used to summarize the topology underlying data. It can be conveniently represented through persistence diagrams. Observing a noisy signal, common strategies to infer its persistence diagram involve plug-in estimators, and convergence properties are then derived from sup-norm stability. This dependence on the sup-norm convergence of the preliminary estimator is restrictive, as it essentially imposes to consider regular classes of signals. Departing from these approaches, we design an estimator based on image persistence. In the context of the Gaussian white noise model, and for large classes of piecewise-H\"older signals, we prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and achieves minimax rates. Notably, these rates coincide with the well known minimax rates for H\"older continuous signals.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free uniform concentration bound for logistic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a novel dimension-free uniform concentration bound for the empirical risk function of constrained logistic regression. Our bound yields a milder sufficient condition for a uniform law of large numbers than conditions derived by the Rademacher complexity argument and McDiarmid's inequality. The derivation is based on the PAC-Bayes approach with second-order expansion and Rademacher-complexity-based bounds for the residual term of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>An adaptive transfer learning perspective on classification in non-stationary environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a semi-supervised classification problem with non-stationary label-shift in which we observe a labelled data set followed by a sequence of unlabelled covariate vectors in which the marginal probabilities of the class labels may change over time. Our objective is to predict the corresponding class-label for each covariate vector, without ever observing the ground-truth labels, beyond the initial labelled data set. Previous work has demonstrated the potential of sophisticated variants of online gradient descent to perform competitively with the optimal dynamic strategy (Bai et al. 2022). In this work we explore an alternative approach grounded in statistical methods for adaptive transfer learning. We demonstrate the merits of this alternative methodology by establishing a high-probability regret bound on the test error at any given individual test-time, which adapt automatically to the unknown dynamics of the marginal label probabilities. Further more, we give bounds on the average dynamic regret which match the average guarantees of the online learning perspective for any given time interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinear spiked random matrix model where a nonlinear function is applied element-wise to a noise matrix perturbed by a rank-one signal. We establish a signal-plus-noise decomposition for this model and identify precise phase transitions in the structure of the signal components at critical thresholds of signal strength. To demonstrate the applicability of this decomposition, we then utilize it to study new phenomena in the problems of signed signal recovery in nonlinear models and community detection in transformed stochastic block models. Finally, we validate our results through a series of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Tensor Methods in High Dimensional Data Analysis: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large amount of multidimensional data represented by multiway arrays or tensors are prevalent in modern applications across various fields such as chemometrics, genomics, physics, psychology, and signal processing. The structural complexity of such data provides vast new opportunities for modeling and analysis, but efficiently extracting information content from them, both statistically and computationally, presents unique and fundamental challenges. Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach that brings together tools and insights from statistics, optimization and numerical linear algebra among other fields. Despite these hurdles, significant progress has been made in the last decade. This review seeks to examine some of the key advancements and identify common threads among them, under eight different statistical settings.</description>

Abstract: An "element-free" probability distribution is what remains of a probability distribution after we forget the elements to which the probabilities were assigned. These objects naturally arise in Bayesian statistics, in situations where elements are used as labels and their specific identity is not important.
  This paper develops the structural theory of element-free distributions, using multisets and category theory. We give operations for moving between element-free and ordinary distributions, and we show that these operations commute with multinomial sampling. We then exploit this theory to prove two representation theorems. These theorems show that element-free distributions provide a natural representation for key random structures in Bayesian nonparametric clustering: exchangeable random partitions, and random distributions parametrized by a base measure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametrics for Principal Stratification with Continuous Post-Treatment Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework that allows adjustment for confounded post-treatment variables when comparing treatments. Although the literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables, there is a growing interest in principal stratification involving continuous post-treatment variables. However, characterizing the latent principal strata with a continuous post-treatment presents a significant challenge, which is further complicated in observational studies where the treatment is not randomized. In this paper, we introduce the Confounders-Aware SHared atoms BAyesian mixture (CASBAH), a novel approach for principal stratification with continuous post-treatment variables that can be directly applied to observational studies. CASBAH leverages a dependent Dirichlet process, utilizing shared atoms across treatment levels, to effectively control for measured confounders and facilitate information sharing between treatment groups in the identification of principal strata membership. CASBAH also offers a comprehensive quantification of uncertainty surrounding the membership of the principal strata. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology has excellent performance in characterizing the latent principal strata and estimating the effects of treatment on post-treatment variables and outcomes. Finally, CASBAH is applied to a case study in which we estimate the causal effects of US national air quality regulations on pollution levels and health outcomes.</description>

      <title>On the Sequence Evaluation based on Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and analyzing long sequences of text is an essential task for Natural Language Processing. Success in capturing long text dynamics using neural language models will facilitate many downstream tasks such as coherence evaluation, text generation, machine translation and so on. This paper presents a novel approach to model sequences through a stochastic process. We introduce a likelihood-based training objective for the text encoder and design a more thorough measurement (score) for long text evaluation compared to the previous approach. The proposed training objective effectively preserves the sequence coherence, while the new score comprehensively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Theoretical properties of our new score show its advantages in sequence evaluation. Experimental results show superior performance in various sequence evaluation tasks, including global and local discrimination within and between documents of different lengths. We also demonstrate the encoder achieves competitive results on discriminating human and AI written text.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</description>

      <title>Random measure priors in Bayesian recovery from sketches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric approach to frequency recovery from lossy-compressed discrete data, leveraging all information contained in a sketch obtained through random hashing. By modeling the data points as random samples from an unknown discrete distribution endowed with a Poisson-Kingman prior, we derive the posterior distribution of a symbol's empirical frequency given the sketch. This leads to principled frequency estimates through mean functionals, e.g., the posterior mean, median and mode. We highlight applications of this general result to Dirichlet process and Pitman-Yor process priors. Notably, we prove that the former prior uniquely satisfies a sufficiency property that simplifies the posterior distribution, while the latter enables a convenient large-sample asymptotic approximation. Additionally, we extend our approach to the problem of cardinality recovery, estimating the number of distinct symbols in the sketched dataset. Our approach to frequency recovery also adapts to a more general ``traits'' setting, where each data point has integer levels of association with multiple symbols, typically referred to as ``traits''. By employing a generalized Indian buffet process, we compute the posterior distribution of a trait's frequency using both the Poisson and Bernoulli distributions for the trait association levels, respectively yielding exact and approximate posterior frequency distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parametric inference for ergodic diffusion processes with a degenerate diffusion matrix. Existing research focuses on a particular class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, with components split into `rough'/`smooth' and noise from rough components propagating directly onto smooth ones, but some critical model classes arising in applications have yet to be explored. We aim to cover this gap, thus analyse the highly degenerate class of SDEs, where components split into further sub-groups. Such models include e.g. the notable case of generalised Langevin equations. We propose a tailored time-discretisation scheme and provide asymptotic results supporting our scheme in the context of high-frequency, full observations. The proposed discretisation scheme is applicable in much more general data regimes and is shown to overcome biases via simulation studies also in the practical case when only a smooth component is observed. Joint consideration of our study for highly degenerate SDEs and existing research provides a general `recipe' for the development of time-discretisation schemes to be used within statistical methods for general classes of hypo-elliptic SDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinal pattern dependence has been introduced in order to capture co-monotonic behavior between two time series. This concept has several features one would intuitively demand from a dependence measure. It was believed that ordinal pattern dependence satisfies the axioms which Grothe et al. (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 123, 2014) proclaimed for a multivariate measure of dependence. In the present article we show that this is not true and that there is a mistake in the article Betken et al. (Journal of Multivariate Analysis 186, 2021). Furthermore we show that ordinal pattern dependence satisfies a slightly modified set of axioms.</description>

      <title>Combining exchangeable p-values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of combining p-values is an old and fundamental one, and the classic assumption of independence is often violated or unverifiable in many applications. There are many well-known rules that can combine a set of arbitrarily dependent p-values (for the same hypothesis) into a single p-value. We show that essentially all these existing rules can be strictly improved when the p-values are exchangeable, or when external randomization is allowed (or both). For example, we derive randomized and/or exchangeable improvements of well known rules like "twice the median" and "twice the average", as well as geometric and harmonic means. Exchangeable p-values are often produced one at a time (for example, under repeated tests involving data splitting), and our rules can combine them sequentially as they are produced, stopping when the combined p-values stabilize. Our work also improves rules for combining arbitrarily dependent p-values, since the latter becomes exchangeable if they are presented to the analyst in a random order. The main technical advance is to show that all existing combination rules can be obtained by calibrating the p-values to e-values (using an $\alpha$-dependent calibrator), averaging those e-values, converting to a level-$\alpha$ test using Markov's inequality, and finally obtaining p-values by combining this family of tests; the improvements are delivered via recent randomized and exchangeable variants of Markov's inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study submodels of Gaussian DAG models defined by partial homogeneity constraints imposed on the model error variances and structural coefficients. We represent these models with colored DAGs and investigate their properties for use in statistical and causal inference. Local and global Markov properties are provided and shown to characterize the colored DAG model. Additional properties relevant to causal discovery are studied, including the existence and non-existence of faithful distributions and structural identifiability. Extending prior work of Peters and B\"uhlman and Wu and Drton, we prove structural identifiability under the assumption of homogeneous structural coefficients, as well as for a family of models with partially homogeneous structural coefficients. The latter models, termed BPEC-DAGs, capture additional causal insights by clustering the direct causes of each node into communities according to their effect on their common target. An analogue of the GES algorithm for learning BPEC-DAGs is given and evaluated on real and synthetic data. Regarding model geometry, we prove that these models are contractible, smooth, algebraic manifolds and compute their dimension. We also provide a proof of a conjecture of Sullivant which generalizes to colored DAG models, colored undirected graphical models and ancestral graph models. The proof yields a tool for the identification of Markov properties for rationally parameterized statistical models with globally, rationally identifiable parameters.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations Using Adjusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In anytime-valid sequential inference, it is known that any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes, which are composite generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any arbitrary stopping time. This paper studies methods for combining e-processes constructed using different information sets (filtrations) for the same null. Although e-processes constructed in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (e.g., by averaging), e-processes constructed in different filtrations cannot, because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to validity in a finer filtration. This issue arises in exchangeability tests, independence tests, and tests for comparing forecasts with lags. We first establish that a class of functions called adjusters allows us to lift e-processes from a coarser filtration into any finer filtration. We then introduce a characterization theorem for adjusters, formalizing a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is an asymptotically logarithmic cost of recovering anytime-validity in the original filtration.</description>
