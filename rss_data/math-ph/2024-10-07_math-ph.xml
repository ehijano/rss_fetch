      <title>Clifford and quadratic composite operators with applications to non-Hermitian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of physical phenomena, such as amplification, absorption, and radiation, can be effectively described using non-Hermitian operators. However, the introduction of non-uniform non-Hermiticity can lead to the formation of exceptional points in a system's spectrum, where two or more eigenvalues become degenerate and their associated eigenvectors coallesce causing the underlying operator or matrix to become defective. Here, we explore extensions of the Clifford and quadratic $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum, previously defined for Hermitian operators, to accommodate non-Hermitian operators and matrices, including the possibility that the underlying operators may possess exceptional points in their spectra. In particular, we provide a framework for finding approximate joint eigenstates of a $d$-tuple of Hermitian operators $\mathbf{A}$ and non-Hermitian operators $\mathbf{B}$, and show that their Clifford and quadratic $\epsilon$-pseudospectra are still well-defined despite any non-normality. We prove that the non-Hermitian quadratic gap is local with respect to the probe location when there are perturbations to one or more of the underlying operators. Altogether, this framework enables the exploration of non-Hermitian physical systems' $\epsilon$-pseudospectra, including but not limited to photonic systems where gain, loss, and radiation are prominent physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Edge transport in Haldane-like models with quasi-periodic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Haldane-like $2d$ topological insulators on the cylinder, in the presence of weak quasi-periodic disorder. We prove that, at large distances, the boundary correlations agree with the correlations of a renormalized, translation-invariant, massless relativistic model in $1+1$ dimensions, multiplied by non-universal oscillatory factors, incommensurate with the lattice spacing. Furthermore, we compute the edge conductance and the edge susceptibility, starting from Kubo formula. We obtain explicit expressions for these response functions, completely determined by the renormalized Fermi velocity of the edge modes. In particular, we prove the quantization of the edge conductance, and the non-universality of the susceptibility. The proof relies on multiscale analysis and rigorous renormalization group methods for quasi-periodic systems, and on lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of the Aztec diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dimer models on growing Aztec diamonds, which are certain domains in the square lattice, with edge weights of the form $\nu(\,\cdot\,)^\beta$, where $\nu(\,\cdot\,)$ is a doubly periodic function on the edges of the lattice and $\beta$ is an inverse temperature parameter.
  We prove that in the zero-temperature ($\beta\to\infty$) limit, and for generic values of $\nu(\,\cdot\,)$, these dimer models undergo crystallization: The limit shape converges to a piecewise linear function called the tropical limit shape, and the local fluctuations are governed by the Gibbs measures with the slope dictated by the tropical limit shape for high enough values of $\beta$.
  We also show that the tropical limit shape and the tropical arctic curve (consisting of ridges of the crystal) are described in terms of a tropical curve and a tropical action function on that curve, which are the tropical analogs of the spectral curve and the action function that describe the finite-temperature models. The tropical curve is explicit in terms of the edge weights, and the tropical action function is a solution of Kirchhoff's problem on the tropical curve.</description>

      <title>Mixed single, double, and triple poles solutions for the space-time shifted nonlocal DNLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions via Riemann--Hilbert approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the space-time shifted nonlocal derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (DNLS) equation under nonzero boundary conditions using the Riemann--Hilbert (RH) approach for the first time. To begin with, in the direct scattering problem, we analyze the analyticity, symmetries, and asymptotic behaviors of the Jost eigenfunctions and scattering matrix functions. Subsequently, we examine the coexistence of $N$-single, $N$-double, and $N$-triple poles in the inverse scattering problem. The corresponding residue conditions, trace formulae, $\theta$ condition, and symmetry relations of the norming constants are obtained. Moreover, we derive the exact expression for the mixed single, double, and triple poles solutions with the reflectionless potentials by solving the relevant RH problem associated with the space-time shifted nonlocal DNLS equation. Furthermore, to further explore the remarkable characteristics of soliton solutions, we graphically illustrate the dynamic behaviors of several representative solutions, such as three-soliton, two-breather, and soliton-breather solutions. Finally, we analyze the effects of shift parameters through graphical simulations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian thermodynamics on symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a symplectic approach to thermodynamics in which thermodynamic transformations are described by Hamiltonian dynamics on thermodynamic spaces. By identifying the spaces of equilibrium states with Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold, we construct a Hamiltonian description of thermodynamic processes where the space of equilibrium states of a system in a certain ensemble is the level set on which the Hamiltonian takes a constant value. In particular, we work out two explicit examples involving the ideal gas. Finally, we describe a Hamiltonian approach towards constructing maps between related thermodynamic systems, e.g., the ideal (non-interacting) gas and interacting gases.</description>

      <title>Tensor category describing anyons in the quantum Hall effect and quantization of conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the quantization of Hall conductance in an infinite plane geometry. We consider a charge-conserving system with a pure, gapped infinite-volume ground state. While Hall conductance is well-defined in this scenario, there is no existing proof of its quantization. Assuming that the conditions necessary to construct the braided $C^*$-tensor category which describes anyonic excitations are satisfied, we demonstrate that the Hall conductance is rational under the assumption that the tensor category is finite.</description>

      <title>Post-groupoids and quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of post-groups was introduced by Bai, Guo and the first two authors recently, which are the global objects corresponding to post-Lie algebras, equivalent to skew-left braces, and can be used to construct set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper, first we introduce the notion of post-groupoids, which consists of a group bundle and some other structures satisfying some compatibility conditions. Post-groupoids reduce to post-groups if the underlying base is one point. An action of a group on a set gives rise to the natural example of post-groupoids. We show that a post-groupoid gives rise to a groupoid (called the Grossman-Larson groupoid), and an action on the original group bundle. Then we introduce the notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators on a groupoid with respect to an action on a group bundle. A relative Rota-Baxter operator naturally gives rise to a post-groupoid and a matched pair of groupoids. One important application of post-groupoids is that they give rise to quiver-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation on the quiver underlying the Grossman-Larson groupoid. We also introduce the notion of a skew-left bracoid, which consists of a group bundle and a groupoid satisfying some compatibility conditions. A skew-left bracoid reduces to a skew-left brace if the underlying base is one point. We give the one-to-one correspondence between post-groupoids and skew-left bracoids. Finally, we show that post-Lie groupoids give rise to post-Lie algebroids via differentiation.</description>

      <title>$m$-step rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"{o}schl-Teller potential based on para-Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous construction of regular rational extensions of the trigonometric Darboux-P\"oschl-Teller potential, obtained by one-step Darboux transformations using seed functions associated with the para-Jacobi polynomials of Calogero and Yi, is generalized by considering $m$-step Darboux transformations. As a result, some novel families of exceptional orthogonal polynomials depending on $m$ discrete parameters, as well as $m$ continuous real ones $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, \ldots, $\lambda_m$, are obtained. The restrictions imposed on these parameters by the rational extensions regularity conditions are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Level-Set Percolation on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solution of the problem of level-set percolation for multivariate Gaussians defined in terms of weighted graph Laplacians on complex networks. It is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach, which allows one to obtain the essential ingredient required for the solution, viz. a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. The cavity solution can be evaluated both for single large instances of locally tree-like graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class. The critical level $h_c$ of the percolation transition is obtained through the condition that the largest eigenvalue of a weighted version $B$ of a non-backtracking matrix satisfies $\lambda_{\rm max}(B)|_{h_c} =1$. We present level-dependent distributions of local percolation probabilities for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and and for networks with degree distributions described by power laws. We find that there is a strong correlation between marginal single-node variances of a massless multivariate Gaussian and local percolation probabilities at a given level $h$, which is nearly perfect at negative values $h$, but weakens as $h\nearrow 0$ for the system with power law degree distribution, and generally also for negative values of $h$, if the multivariate Gaussian acquires a non-zero mass. The theoretical analysis simplifies in the case of random regular graphs with uniform edge-weights of the weighted graph Laplacian of the system and uniform mass parameter of the Gaussian field. An asymptotic analysis reveals that for edge-weights $K=K(c)\equiv 1$ the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ decreases to 0, as the degree $c$ of the random regular graph diverges. For $K=K(c)=1/c$, on the other hand, the critical percolation threshold $h_c$ is shown to diverge as $c\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Nonassicative cosmological solitonic R-flux deformations in gauge gravity and G. Perelman geometric flow thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative gauge gravity for the de Sitter gauge group $SO(4,1)$ embedding extensions of the affine structure group $Af(4,1)$ and the Poincar\'{e} group $ISO(3,1)$. In string theory, such nonassociative gauge gravity theories are determined by star product R-flux deformations. They are new avenues to quantum gravity and geometric and quantum information theories. We analyze physically important and geometric thermodynamic properties of new classes of generic off-diagonal cosmological solitonic solutions encoding nonassociative effective sources. Particularly, we focus on modelling by such solutions of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous dark matter and dark energy structures generated as nonassociative solitonic hierarchies. Such accelerating cosmological evolution scenarios can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic formalism. This motivates a change in the gravitational thermodynamic paradigm by considering nonassociative and relativistic generalizations of the concept of W-entropy in the theory of Ricci flows. Finally, we compute the corresponding modified G. Perelman's thermodynamic variables and analyze the temperature-like evolution of cosmological constants determined by nonassociative cosmological flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative Einstein--Dirac-Maxwell, EDM, theory determined by star product R-flux deformations in string theory. Solutions for nonassociative EDM systems and physical properties not studied in modern physics. For modifications of the four-dimensional, 4-d, Einstein gravity, we work on conventional nonassociative 8-d phase spaces modelled as star-deformed co-tangent Lorentz bundles. Generalizing the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, the nonassociative EDM equations are decoupled and integrated in exact and parametric quasi-stationary forms. Corresponding generic off-diagonal metrics are described by nonlinear symmetries and encode nonassociative effective sources and generating functions depending on space and momentum-like coordinates. For respective nonholonomic parameterizations, such solutions describe nonassociative deformations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. A variant of nonassociative phase space wormhole solution with fermions possessing anisotropic polarized masses is also analyzed. We conclude that such phase space physical objects can't be characterized using the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and show how to compute another type (modified G. Perelman ones) nonassociative geometric and statistical thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Framing global structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key initial step in mechanistic modelling of dynamical systems using first-order ordinary differential equations is to conduct a global structural identifiability analysis. This entails deducing which parameter combinations can be estimated from certain observed outputs. The standard differential algebra approach answers this question by re-writing the model as a system of ordinary differential equations solely depending on the observed outputs. Over the last decades, alternative approaches for analysing global structural identifiability based on so-called full symmetries, which are Lie symmetries acting on independent and dependent variables as well as parameters, have been proposed. However, the link between the standard differential algebra approach and that using full symmetries remains elusive. In this work, we establish this link by introducing the notion of parameter symmetries, which are a special type of full symmetry that alter parameters while preserving the observed outputs. Our main result states that a parameter combination is structurally identifiable if and only if it is a differential invariant of all parameter symmetries of a given model. We show that the standard differential algebra approach is consistent with the concept of considering structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries. We present an alternative symmetry-based approach, referred to as the CaLinInv-recipe, for analysing structural identifiability using parameter symmetries. Lastly, we demonstrate our approach on a glucose-insulin model and an epidemiological model of tuberculosis.</description>

      <title>Efficient self-consistent learning of gate set Pauli noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum noise is an essential step towards building practical quantum information processing systems. Pauli noise is a useful model that has been widely applied in quantum benchmarking, error mitigation, and error correction. Despite intensive study, most existing works focus on learning Pauli noise channels associated with some specific gates rather than treating the gate set as a whole. A learning algorithm that is self-consistent, complete, and efficient at the same time is yet to be established. In this work, we study the task of gate set Pauli noise learning, where a set of quantum gates, state preparation, and measurements all suffer from unknown Pauli noise channels with a customized noise ansatz. Using tools from algebraic graph theory, we analytically characterize the self-consistently learnable degrees of freedom for Pauli noise models with arbitrary linear ansatz, and design experiments to efficiently learn all the learnable information. Specifically, we show that all learnable information about the gate noise can be learned to relative precision, under mild assumptions on the noise ansatz. We then demonstrate the flexibility of our theory by applying it to concrete physically motivated ansatzs (such as spatially local or quasi-local noise) and experimentally relevant gate sets (such as parallel CZ gates). These results not only enhance the theoretical understanding of quantum noise learning, but also provide a feasible recipe for characterizing existing and near-future quantum information processing devices.</description>

      <title>Lighthill's theory of sound generation in a non-isothermal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lighthill's theory of sound generation was developed to calculate acoustic radiation from a narrow region of turbulent flow embedded in an infinite homogeneous fluid. The theory is extended to include a simple model of non-isothermal medium that allows finding analytical solutions. The effects of one specific temperature gradient on the wave generation and propagation are studied. It is shown that that presence of the temperature gradient in the region of wave generation leads to monopole and dipole sources of acoustic emission, and that the efficiency of these two sources may be higher than Lighthill's quadrupoles. In addition, the wave propagation far from the source is different than in Lighthill's original work because of the presence of the acoustic cutoff frequency resulting from the temperature gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of complex matrices were introduced by James in multivariate statistics. These special functions play many roles in random matrix theory. The main goal of this paper is to suggest a new use for them as holomorphic observables of the Circular Unitary Ensemble. We analyze the high-dimensional behavior of the expected derivatives of these random analytic functions, and show that they admit asymptotic expansions which can be described in terms of quasimodular forms, giving an apparently new connection between the CUE and number theory.</description>

Abstract: The paper surveys open problems and questions related to interplay between the theory of integrable systems with infinitely and finitely many degrees of freedom and Nijenhuis geometry.
  This text has grown out from preparatory materials for the series of research symposia and workshops on Nijenhuis geometry and integrable systems held at SMRI (Sydney) and MATRIX (Creswick) in February 2022 and at La Trobe University (Melbourne) and MATRIX in February 2024, and from the open problem sessions at these events.
  It includes both relatively simple questions to get familiar with the topic, as well as challenging problems that are of great importance for the field.</description>

      <title>Operational meaning of the fidelity and the Fisher-Bures path length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the minimum entropy production in near-reversible quantum state transport along a path is a simple function of the path length measured according to the Fisher--Bures metrics. Consequently, the minimum entropy production along a geodesics is the simple function of fidelity. Hence the sharp values of path lengths, also called statistical lengths, and of fidelities obtain operational meaning to quantify the residual irreversibility in near-reversible state transport. Compared to fidelity's operative interpretations based on Uhlmann's theorem, our proposal does not assume extended operations on the purified states. As to the classical limit, the Bhattacharryya fidelity obtains a sharp operational meaning after eighty years.</description>

      <title>Random non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework for symmetry breaking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <title>Calmed Ohmic Heating for the 2D Magnetohydrodynamic-Boussinesq System: Global Well-posedness and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an electric current runs through a fluid, it generates heat via a process known as ``Ohmic heating'' or ``Joule heating.'' While this phenomenon, and its quantification known as Joule's Law, is the first studied example of heat generation via an electric field, many difficulties still remain in understanding its consequences. In particular, a magnetic fluid naturally generates an electric field via Amp\`ere's law, which heats the fluid via Joule's law. This heat in turn gives rise to convective effects in the fluid, creating complicated dynamical behavior. This has been modeled (in other works) by including an Ohmic heating term in the Magnetohydrodynamic-Boussinessq (MHD-B) equation. However, the structure of this term causes major analytical difficulties, and basic questions of well-posedness remain open problems, even in the two-dimensional case. Moreover, standard approaches to finding a globally well-posed approximate model, such as filtering or adding high-order diffusion, are not enough to handle the Ohmic heating term. In this work, we present a different approach that we call ``calming'', which reduces the effective algebraic degree of the Ohmic heating term in a controlled manner. We show that this new model is globally well-posed, and moreover, its solutions converge to solutions of the MHD-B system with the Ohmic heating term (assuming that solutions to the original equation exist), making it the first globally well-posed approximate model for the MHD-B equation with Ohmic heating.</description>

      <title>Morse Index for Homothetic motions in the gravitational n-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the gravitation n-body Problem, a homothetic orbit is a special solution of the Newton's Equations of motion, in which each body moves along a straight line through the center of mass and forming at any time a central configuration. In 2020, Portaluri et al. proved that under a spectral gap condition on the limiting central configuration, known in literature as non-spiraling or [BS]-condition, the Morse index of an asymptotic colliding motion is finite. Later Ou et al. proved this result for other classes of unbounded motions, e.g. doubly asymptotic motions (e.g. doubly homothetic motions).
  In this paper we prove that for a homothetic motion, irrespective of how large the index of the limiting central configuration and how large the energy level is, the following alternative holds: if the non-spiraling condition holds then the Morse index is 0 otherwise it is infinite.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Algebra Made Simple for Thermoelectric Generator Module Performance Prediction under Constant Seebeck-Coefficient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalization properties of binary logistic classification in a simplified setting, for which a "memorizing" and "generalizing" solution can always be strictly defined, and elucidate empirically and analytically the mechanism underlying Grokking in its dynamics. We analyze the asymptotic long-time dynamics of logistic classification on a random feature model with a constant label and show that it exhibits Grokking, in the sense of delayed generalization and non-monotonic test loss. We find that Grokking is amplified when classification is applied to training sets which are on the verge of linear separability. Even though a perfect generalizing solution always exists, we prove the implicit bias of the logisitc loss will cause the model to overfit if the training data is linearly separable from the origin. For training sets that are not separable from the origin, the model will always generalize perfectly asymptotically, but overfitting may occur at early stages of training. Importantly, in the vicinity of the transition, that is, for training sets that are almost separable from the origin, the model may overfit for arbitrarily long times before generalizing. We gain more insights by examining a tractable one-dimensional toy model that quantitatively captures the key features of the full model. Finally, we highlight intriguing common properties of our findings with recent literature, suggesting that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>On the K-theory of magnetic algebras: Iwatsuka case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tight-binding approximation, an Iwatsuka magnetic field is modeled by a function on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with constant, but distinct values in the two parts of the lattice separated by a straight line of slope $\alpha\in [-\infty,\infty]$. In this paper, the $K$-theory of the magnetic $C^*$-algebras generated by an Iwatsuka magnetic field for any possible $\alpha$ is computed. One interesting aspect concerns the analysis of the behavior of the system in the transition from rational to irrational $\alpha$. It turns out that when $\alpha$ is irrational, the magnetic hull associated with the flux operator forms a Cantor set. On the other hand, for rational $\alpha$ this set coincides with the two-point compactification of $\mathbb{Z}$. This characterization, along with the use of the Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence, is the main ingredient for the computation of the $K$-theory. Once the $K$-theory is known, with the use of the index theory one can deduce the bulk-interface correspondence for tight-binding Hamiltonians subjected to an Iwatsuka magnetic field. Notably, it occurs that the topological quantization of the interface currents remains independent of the slope $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the passivity constraints on the relations between transmission, reflection, and absorption eigenvalues in linear time-invariant systems. Using techniques from matrix analysis, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the permissible combinations of these eigenvalues. Our analysis reveals that the set of allowable eigenvalue combinations forms a convex polyhedron in eigenvalue space, characterized by a trace equality and a set of linear inequalities. Surprisingly, we uncover a direct connection between this physical problem and Alfred Horn's inequalities, a fundamental result in matrix theory. We provide explicit examples for systems with varying numbers of input ports, demonstrating the increasing complexity of the constraints as system size grows. We apply our theory to analyze the implications of important phenomena, including open and closed channels, coherent perfect reflection and reflectionless scattering modes, and coherent perfect absorption and coherent zero absorption. Our findings not only offer a complete characterization of passivity constraints on wave transport eigenvalues but also establish an unexpected bridge between fundamental wave physics and advanced matrix theory, opening new avenues for research at their intersection. These results have significant implications for the design and optimization of passive wave devices across a wide range of applications in optics, acoustics, and mesoscopic physics.</description>

Abstract: We study inhomogeneous non-strictly hyperbolic systems of two equations, which are a formal generalization of the transformed one-dimensional Euler-Poisson equations. For such systems, a complete classification of the behavior of the solution is carried out depending on the right side. In particular, criteria for the formation of singularities in the solution of the Cauchy problem in terms of initial data are found. Also we determine the domains of attraction of equilibria of the extended system for derivatives. We prove the existence of solutions in the form of simple waves. The results obtained are applied to study the main model cases of the Euler-Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>The role of interface boundary conditions and sampling strategies for Schwarz-based coupling of projection-based reduced order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates a framework for the coupling of subdomain-local projection-based reduced order models (PROMs) using the Schwarz alternating method following a domain decomposition (DD) of the spatial domain on which a given problem of interest is posed. In this approach, the solution on the full domain is obtained via an iterative process in which a sequence of subdomain-local problems are solved, with information propagating between subdomains through transmission boundary conditions (BCs). We explore several new directions involving the Schwarz alternating method aimed at maximizing the method's efficiency and flexibility, and demonstrate it on three challenging two-dimensional nonlinear hyperbolic problems: the shallow water equations, Burgers' equation, and the compressible Euler equations. We demonstrate that, for a cell-centered finite volume discretization and a non-overlapping DD, it is possible to obtain a stable and accurate coupled model utilizing Dirichlet-Dirichlet (rather than Robin-Robin or alternating Dirichlet-Neumann) transmission BCs on the subdomain boundaries. We additionally explore the impact of boundary sampling when utilizing the Schwarz alternating method to couple subdomain-local hyper-reduced PROMs. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed methodology has the potential to improve PROM accuracy by enabling the spatial localization of these models via domain decomposition, and achieve up to two orders of magnitude speedup over equivalent coupled full order model solutions and moderate speedups over analogous monolithic solutions.</description>

      <title>Dislocations and Fibrations: The Topological Structure of Knotted Smectic Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the topological properties of knotted defects in smectic liquid crystals. Our story begins with screw dislocations, whose radial surface structure can be smoothly accommodated on $S^3$ for fibred knots by using the corresponding knot fibration. To understand how a smectic texture may take on a screw dislocation in the shape of a knot without a fibration, we study first knotted edge defects. Unlike screw defects, knotted edge dislocations force singular points in the system for any non-trivial knot. We provide a lower bound on the number of such point defects required for a given edge dislocation knot and draw an analogy between the point defect structure of knotted edge dislocations and that of focal conic domains. By showing that edge dislocations, too, are sensitive to knot fibredness, we reinterpret the so-called Morse-Novikov points required for non-fibred screw dislocation knots as analogous smectic defects. Our methods are then applied to $+1/2$ and negative-charge disclinations in the smectic phase, furthering the analogy between knotted smectic defects and focal conic domains and uncovering an intricate relationship between point and line defects in smectic liquid crystals. The connection between smectic defects and knot theory not only unravels the uniquely topological knotting of smectic defects but also provides a mathematical and experimental playground for modern questions in knot and Morse-Novikov theory.</description>

      <title>Uniform Energy Bound for Maxwell-Higgs Equations on Reissner-Nordstr\"om Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the uniform energy bound for the Maxwell-Higgs system in the exterior region of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing an integrated local energy decay (ILED) estimate in combination with the Sobolev embedding theorem on a compact Riemannian manifold, we derived $L^\infty$ bounds for the fields. These results were then used to obtain a bound for the conformal energy of the system using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hardy-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Exponentially-growing Mode Instability on Reissner-Nordstr\"om--Anti-de-Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct growing mode solutions to the uncharged and charged Klein-Gordon equations on the sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om--anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime under reflecting (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary conditions. Our result applies to a range of Klein-Gordon masses above the so-called Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, notably including the conformal mass case. The mode instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om--AdS spacetime for some black hole parameters is in sharp contrast to the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime, where the solution to the Klein-Gordon equation is known to decay in time. Contrary to other mode instability results on the Kerr and Kerr-AdS spacetimes, our growing mode solutions of the uncharged and weakly charged Klein-Gordon equation exist independently of the occurrence or absence of superradiance. We discover a novel mechanism leading to a growing mode solution, namely, a near-extremal instability for the Klein-Gordon equation. Our result seems to be the first rigorous mathematical realization of this instability.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spherically Symmetric Hairy Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct one-parameter families of static spherically symmetric asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole solutions $(\mathcal{M},g_{\epsilon},\phi_{\epsilon})$ to the Einstein-Maxwell-(charged) Klein-Gordon equations. Each family bifurcates off a sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{0},\phi_{0}\equiv0)$. For a co-dimensional one set of black hole parameters, we show that Dirichlet (respectively Neumann) boundary conditions can be imposed for the scalar field. The construction provides a counter-example to a version of the no-hair conjecture in the context of a negative cosmological constant. Our result is based on our companion work [W. Zheng, \emph{Exponentially-growing Mode Instability on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de-Sitter black holes}], in which the existence of linear hair and growing mode solutions have been established. In the charged scalar field case, our result provides the first rigorous mathematical construction of the so-called holographic superconductors, which are of particular significance in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Annulus crossing formulae for critical planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact formulae for three basic annulus crossing events for the critical planar Bernoulli percolation in the continuum limit. The first is for the probability that there is an open path connecting the two boundaries of an annulus of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. The second is for the probability that there are both open and closed paths connecting the two annulus boundaries. These two results were predicted by Cardy based on non-rigorous Coulomb gas arguments. Our third result gives the probability that there are two disjoint open paths connecting the two boundaries. Its leading asymptotic as $r/R\to 0$ is captured by the so-called backbone exponent, a transcendental number recently determined by Nolin, Qian and two of the authors. This exponent is the unique real root to the equation $\frac{\sqrt{36 x +3}}{4} + \sin (\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{12 x +1}}{3} ) =0$, other than $-\frac{1}{12}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. Besides these three real roots, this equation has countably many complex roots. Our third result shows that these roots appear exactly as exponents of the subleading terms in the crossing formula. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Expanding the same crossing probability as $r/R\to 1$, we obtain a series with logarithmic corrections at every order, suggesting that the backbone exponent is related to a logarithmic boundary CFT. Our proofs are based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The key is to encode the annulus crossing probabilities by the random moduli of certain LQG surfaces with annular topology, whose law can be extracted from the dependence of the LQG annuli partition function on their boundary lengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in inequalities that bound the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet and Neumann Laplaciancs in terms of their semiclassical counterpart. We show that the classical inequalities of Berezin-Li-Yau and Kr\"oger, valid for Riesz exponents $\gamma\geq 1$, extend to certain values $\gamma&lt;1$, provided the underlying domain is convex. We also characterize the implications of a possible failure of P\'olya's conjecture for convex sets in terms of Riesz means. These findings allow us to describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions of a spectral shape optimization problem for convex sets.</description>

      <title>Distance Form Factor of a Homogeneous Poisson Point Process and a Coulomb Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a distance form factor (DFF) for the characterization of spatial patterns associated with point processes. Specifically, the DFF is defined in terms of the averaged even Fourier transform of the distance between any pair of points. We focus on homogeneous Poisson point processes and derive the explicit expression for the DFF in $d$-spatial dimensions. The DFF can then be found in terms of the even Fourier transform of the probability distribution for the distance between two independent and uniformly distributed random points on a $d$-dimensional ball, arising in the ball line picking problem. The relation between the DFF and the set of $n$-order spacing distributions is further established. The DFF is analyzed in detail for $d=1,2,3$ and in the infinite-dimensional case, as well as for the $d$-dimensional Coulomb gas, as an interacting point process.</description>

      <title>STEGR in Internal-Space Formulation: Formalisms, Primary Constraints, and Possible Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Focal surfaces and evolutes of framed curves in hyperbolic 3-space from the viewpoint of Legendrian duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hyperbolic framed curve is a smooth curve with a moving frame in hyperbolic 3-space. It may have singularities. By using this moving frame, we can investigate the differential geometry properties of curves, even at singular points. In fact, we consider the focal surfaces and evolutes of hyperbolic framed curves by using Legendrian dualities which developed by Chen and Izumiya. The focal surfaces are the dual surfaces of tangent indicatrix of original curves. Moreover, classifications of singularities of the serval dual surfaces are shown. By this, we give the relationship among focal surfaces, evolutes and dual surfaces of evolutes. Finally, we study duality relations of singularities between focal surfaces and dual surfaces of evolutes.</description>

Our proof uses the Howe duality for $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$, as well as branching rules for Kac modules. Moreover, we derive the branching rules of type 2 unitary simple $\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n}$-modules, which are dual to the aforementioned unitary modules.</description>

      <title>Riemannian-geometric generalizations of quantum fidelities and Bures-Wasserstein distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of fidelities based on the Riemannian geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold we call the generalized fidelity. We show that this family of fidelities generalizes standard quantum fidelities such as Uhlamnn-, Holevo-, and Matsumoto fidelity and demonstrate that it satisfies analogous celebrated properties. The generalized fidelity naturally arises from a generalized Bures distance, the natural distance obtained from the linearization of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We prove various invariance and covariance properties of generalized fidelity as the point of linearization moves along geodesic-related paths. We also provide a Block-matrix characterization and prove an Uhlmann-like theorem, as well as provide further extensions to the multivariate setting and quantum Renyi divergences, generalizing Petz-, Sandwich-, Reverse sandwich-, and Geometric Renyi divergences of order $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work of the authors, we investigated the Born and inverse Born series for a scalar wave equation with linear and nonlinear terms, the nonlinearity being cubic of Kerr type [8]. We reported conditions which guarantee convergence of the inverse Born series, enabling recovery of the coefficients of the linear and nonlinear terms. In this work, we show that if the coefficient of the linear term is known, an arbitrarily strong Kerr nonlinearity can be reconstructed, for sufficiently small data. Additionally, we show that similar convergence results hold for general polynomial nonlinearities. Our results are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the existence of a massless spinor degrees of freedom in a spacetime with internal boundaries, such as black holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as GR with dark energy and some dark fluid. This can alleviate the problems of dark energy, and perhaps of dark matter. The dark fluid term remains to be further analysed. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the solvability of the magnetohydrostatic equations with Grad-Rubin boundary conditions in general domains. Earlier results for this problem were obtained in the recent years by D. Alonso-Or\'an and J. L. L. Vel\'azquez, where particularly simple geometries were considered. In this article we develop a theory that allows to solve these boundary value problems for a larger class of domains. We will give precise applications to more physically relevant situations, like the case of the space between two circumferences or spheres and domains close to them.</description>

      <title>Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

      <title>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</description>

      <title>Matrix-weighted networks for modeling multidimensional dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are powerful tools for modeling interactions in complex systems. While traditional networks use scalar edge weights, many real-world systems involve multidimensional interactions. For example, in social networks, individuals often have multiple interconnected opinions that can affect different opinions of other individuals, which can be better characterized by matrices. We propose a novel, general framework for modeling such multidimensional interacting dynamics: matrix-weighted networks (MWNs). We present the mathematical foundations of MWNs and examine consensus dynamics and random walks within this context. Our results reveal that the coherence of MWNs gives rise to non-trivial steady states that generalize the notions of communities and structural balance in traditional networks.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuous symmetries and quantum topology of Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems in which a continuous symmetry $G$, which may be anomalous, is spontaneously broken to an anomaly-free subgroup $H$ such that the effective action for the Goldstone modes contains topologically non-trivial terms. If the original system has trivial $G$ anomaly, it is known that the possible topological terms are fully determined by SPT or SET invariants of the residual $H$ symmetry. Here we address the more general setting in which the $G$ symmetry has an anomaly. We argue that in general, the appropriate concept to consider is the "compatibility relation" between the Goldstone invariants and the $G$ anomaly. In the case where the Goldstone modes can be gapped out to obtain invertible families (i.e. without any topological order), we give an explicit mathematical scheme to construct the desired compatibility relation. We also address the case where gapping out the Goldstone modes leads to a family of topologically ordered states. We discuss several examples including the canonical Thouless pump, the quantum Hall ferromagnet, pumps arising from breaking $\text{U}(1)$ symmetry at the boundary of topological insulators in two and three dimensions, and pumps classified by the higher Chern number.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

Abstract: A simple condition is given that is sufficient to determine whether a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gau{\ss}ian measure on the space of distributions is reflection positive. It readily generalises conventional lattice results to an abstract setting, enabling the construction of many reflection positive measures that are not supported on lattices.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work concerns the analysis of electromagnetic dispersive media modelled by generalized Lorentz models. More precisely, this paper is the second of two articles dedicated to the long time behaviour of solutions of Maxwell's equations in dissipative Lorentz media, via the long time decay rate of the electromagnetic energy for the corresponding Cauchy problem. In opposition to the frequency dependent Lyapunov functions approach used in [Cassier, Joly, Rosas Mart\'inez, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 74 (2023), 115], we develop a method based on the spectral analysis of the underlying non-self-adjoint operator of the model. Although more involved, this approach is closer to physics, as it uses the dispersion relation of the model, and has the advantage to provide more precise and more optimal results, leading to distinguish the notion of weak and strong dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 1979 paper, Ventevogel and Nijboer showed that classical point particles interacting via the pair potential $\phi(x)=\left(1+x^4\right)^{-1}$ are not equally spaced in their ground states in one dimension when the particle density is high, in contrast with many other potentials such as inverse power laws or Gaussians. In this paper, we explore a broad class of potentials for which this property holds; we prove that under the potentials $f_\alpha(x)=\left(1+x^\alpha\right)^{-1}$, when $\alpha&gt;2$ is an even integer, there is a corresponding $s_\alpha&gt;0$ such that under density $\rho={n}/{s_\alpha}$, the configuration that places $n$ particles at each point of $s_\alpha\mathbb{Z}$ minimises the average potential energy per particle and is therefore the exact ground state. In other words, the particles form clusters, while the clusters do not approach each other as the density increases; instead they maintain a fixed spacing. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of such a ground state for a naturally occurring class of potential functions.</description>

      <title>The General Three-Body Problem in Conformal-Euclidean Space: Hidden Symmetries and New Properties of a Low-Dimensional Syste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the huge number of research into the three-body problem in physics and mathematics, the study of this problem still remains relevant both from the point of view of its broad application and taking into account its fundamental significance for the theory of dynamical systems. In addition, to solve the problem of quantum-to-classical transition, it is important to answer the question: is irreversibility fundamental to the description of the classical world? To answer this question, we considered a reference classical dynamical system, the general three-body problem, formulating it in conformal Euclidean space and rigorously proving its equivalence to the Newtonian three-body problem. It is shown that a curved configuration space with a local coordinate system reveals new hidden symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system, which makes it possible to reduce the problem to a 6th order system instead of the known 8th order. The most important consequence of this consideration is that the chronologizing parameter of the motion of a system of particles, which we call internal time, is in the general case irreversible, which is characteristic of the general three-body problem. An equation is derived that describes the evolution of the flow of geodesic trajectories, with the help of which the entropy of the system is constructed. New criteria for assessing the complexity of a low-dimensional dynamic system and the dimension of stochastic fractal structures arising in three-dimensional space are obtained. An effective mathematical algorithm has been developed for the numerical simulation of the general three-body problem, which is traditionally a difficult-to-solve system of stiff ordinary differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a frictionless system coupled to an external Markovian environment. The quantum and classical evolution of such systems are described by the Lindblad and the Fokker-Planck equation respectively. We show that when such a system is given by an at most quadratically growing Hamiltonian and at most linearly growing real jump functions, the quantum and classical evolutions remain close on time scales much longer than Ehrenfest time. In particular, we show that the evolution of a density matrix by the Lindblad equation is close in trace norm to the quantization of the corresponding evolution by the Fokker-Planck equation. Such agreement improves upon recent results [arXiv:2403.09345, arXiv:2306.13717, arXiv:2307.05326], which proved long time agreement in weaker norms.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry protected states (SPT's) of quantum spin systems were studied by several authors. For one-dimensional systems (spin chains), there is an essentially complete and rigorous understanding: SPT's corresponding to finite on-site symmetry groups $G$ are classified by the second cohomology group $H^2(G,U(1))$, as established by Kapustin et al. [J. Math. Phys. (2021)]. We extend this result to the case of compact topological symmetry groups $G$. We also strengthen the existing results in the sense that our classification results holds within the class of spin chains with locally bounded on-site dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Catalysts open up new reaction pathways that can speed up chemical reactions while not consuming the catalyst. A similar phenomenon has been discovered in quantum information science, where physical transformations become possible by utilizing a quantum degree of freedom that returns to its initial state at the end of the process. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the concept of catalysis in quantum information science is presented and its applications in various physical contexts are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain a broad class of teleportation protocols using insights from locality. In the "standard" teleportation protocols we consider, all outcome-dependent unitaries are Pauli operators conditioned on linear functions of the measurement outcomes. We find that all such protocols involve preparing a "resource state" exhibiting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order with Abelian protecting symmetry $\mathcal{G}_{k}= (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)^k$. The $k$ logical states are teleported between the edges of the chain by measuring the corresponding $2k$ string order parameters in the bulk and applying outcome-dependent Paulis. Hence, this single class of nontrivial SPT states is both necessary and sufficient for the standard teleportation of $k$ qubits. We illustrate this result with several examples, including the cluster state, variants thereof, and a nonstabilizer hypergraph state.</description>

Abstract: Using the matrix-resolvent method and a formula of the second-named author on the $n$-point function for a KP tau-function, we show that the tau-function of an arbitrary solution to the Toda lattice hierarchy is a KP tau-function. We then generalize this result to tau-functions for the extended Toda hierarchy (ETH) by developing the matrix-resolvent method for the ETH. As an example the partition function of Gromov--Witten invariants of the complex projective line is a KP tau-function, and an application on irreducible representations of the symmetric group is obtained.</description>

      <title>Symmetric functions from the six-vertex model in half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic six-vertex model in half-space with generic integrable boundary weights, and define two families of multivariate rational symmetric functions. Using commutation relations between double-row operators, we prove a skew Cauchy identity of these functions. In a certain degeneration of the right-hand side of the Cauchy identity we obtain the partition function of the six-vertex model in a half-quadrant, and give a Pfaffian formula for this quantity. The Pfaffian is a direct generalization of a formula obtained by Kuperberg in his work on symmetry classes of alternating-sign matrices. One of our families of symmetric functions admits an integral (sum over residues) formula, and we use this to conjecture an orthogonality property of the dual family. We conclude by studying the reduction of our integral formula to transition probabilities of the (initially empty) asymmetric simple exclusion process on the half-line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of distributions which may be considered as a smoothed probabilistic version of the ultrametric property that famously characterizes the Gibbs distributions of various spin glass models. This class of \emph{high-entropy step} (HES) distributions is expressive enough to capture a distribution achieving near-optimal average energy on spin glass models in the so-called full Replica-Symmetry Breaking (fRSB) regime.
  Simultaneously, with high probability, there are polynomial-size certificates on the average energy achievable by \emph{any} HES distribution which are tight within a constant factor. These certificates can be found in polynomial time by a semidefinite program corresponding to a sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy we introduce, termed the HES SoS hierarchy. This improves over classical sum-of-squares certificates which are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Lorentzian quantum cosmology: No-boundary saddles and resummation of quantum gravity corrections around tunneling saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the path-integral approach to the wave function of the Universe by utilizing Lefschetz thimble analyses and resurgence theory. The traditional Euclidean path-integral of gravity has the notorious ambiguity of the direction of Wick rotation. In contrast, the Lorentzian method can be formulated concretely with the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Yet, a challenge remains: the physical parameter space lies on a Stokes line, meaning that the Lefschetz-thimble structure is still unclear. Through complex deformations, we resolve this issue by uniquely identifying the thimble structure. This leads to the tunneling wave function, as opposed to the no-boundary wave function, offering a more rigorous proof of the previous results. Further exploring the parameter space, we discover rich structures: the ambiguity of the Borel resummation of perturbative series around the tunneling saddle points is exactly canceled by the ambiguity of the contributions from no-boundary saddle points. This indicates that resurgence also works in quantum cosmology, particularly in the minisuperspace model.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of first-class constraints and the quantization of gauge theories: from "matter without matter" to the reappearance of time in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make a conceptual overview of a particular approach to the initial-value problem in canonical gauge theories. We stress how the first-class phase-space constraints may be relaxed if we interpret them as fixing the values of new degrees of freedom. This idea goes back to Fock and Stueckelberg, leading to restrictions of the gauge symmetry of a theory, and it corresponds, in certain cases, to promoting constants of Nature to physical fields. Recently, different versions of this formulation have gained considerable attention in the literature, with several independent iterations, particularly in classical and quantum descriptions of gravity, cosmology, and electromagnetism. In particular, in the case of canonical quantum gravity, the Fock--Stueckelberg approach is relevant to the so-called problem of time. Our overview recalls and generalizes the work of Fock and Stueckelberg and its physical interpretation with the aim of conceptually unifying the different iterations of the idea that appear in the literature and of motivating further research.</description>

      <title>New exact solution and $\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series will address the projection postulate and the question of measurement in this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the local spectral statistics in the localised region of various random operator models, including the $d$-dimensional the Anderson model and random Schr\"odinger operators. It is already established, in the above models, that at an energy $E$, in the localised energy region of the spectrum, where the density of states $n(E) &gt; 0$, the local eigenvalue statistics $X_E$ is a Poisson processes with intensity $n(E) \mathcal{L}$, $\mathcal{L}$ being the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The question of independence of $X_E, X_{E^\prime}$ for distinct energies was partially solved in the literature. We solve it completely for all the models for which the Minami technique works.</description>

      <title>Black Flowers and Real Forms of Higher Spin Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Chern-Simons formulation, we investigate higher spin (HS) black holes in AdS$_{3}$ with soft Heisenberg hair and establish linkage with the real forms of the underlying complexified gauge symmetries taken here as $SL(N,C)_{L}\times SL(N,C)_{R}.$ We study the various conserved currents characterizing the HS black flowers (HS-BF) and show that they can be formed of layers indexed by the elements of the centre of the gauge symmetry. This feature follows from requiring the holonomy of the asymptotic gauge connection around the thermal cycle to sit in the centre $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ of the symmetry group. With regard to the compact subgroups of the real forms of the complexified gauge symmetry, we calculate the entropies of the HS-BF and verify that, unless we are considering trivial holonomies, there are no continuous paths joining the HS-BF to the core spin 2 black holes. As explicit illustrations, we give quantum field realisations of the soft Heisenberg hair in terms of bosonic and fermionic primary conformal fields and compute the HS-BF entropy as a function of the number of fermions occupying the ground state of the Heisenberg soft hair.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in the search for generating potentials for which the underlying Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solvable, we report in the recent work several situations when a zero-energy state becomes bound depending on certain restrictions on the coupling constants that define the potential. In this regard, we present evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) potentials that correspond to the rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland (TCS) model. Our procedure is based upon the use of the standard potential group approach with an underlying $so(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes a point canonical transformation with three distinct types of potentials emerging having the same eigenvalues while their common properties are subjected to the evaluation of the relevant wave functions. These cases are treated individually by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

Abstract: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion irrespectively of the type of metric.

      <title>Emergent family of Tsallis entropies from the $q$-deformed combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the derivation of a formula for the $q$-generalised multinomial coefficient rooted in the $q$-deformed algebra, a foundational framework in the study of nonextensive statistics. Previous approximate expressions in the literature diverge as $q$ approaches 2 (or 0, depending on convention). In contrast, our derived formula provides an exact, smooth function for all real values of $q$, expressed as an infinite series expansion involving Tsallis entropies with sequential entropic indices, coupled with Bernoulli numbers. This formulation is achieved through the analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function, stemming from the $q$-deformed factorials. Our formula thus offers a distinctive characterisation of Tsallis entropy within the $q$-deformed combinatorics. Throughout this exploration, we also highlight a symmetry within the $q$-deformed theory that links different values of the entropic parameter. Furthermore, we discuss extending our results to encompass more general, affinity-sensitive cases, building on the previously established framework of affinity-based extended entropy.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin describing the latter ring in terms of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Our isomorphism gives a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</description>

      <title>Deformation maps in proto-twilled Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to find a unified approach to studying the cohomology theories of various operators on Leibniz algebras. We first introduce deformation maps in a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra to do this. Such maps generalize various well-known operators (such as homomorphisms, derivations, crossed homomorphisms, Rota-Baxter operators, modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators, Reynolds operators etc) defined on Leibniz algebras and embedding tensors on Lie algebras. We define the cohomology of a deformation map unifying the existing cohomologies of all the operators mentioned above. Then we construct a curved $L_\infty$-algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are precisely deformation maps in a given proto-twilled Leibniz algebra. In particular, we get the Maurer-Cartan characterizations of modified Rota-Baxter operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and Reynolds operators on a Leibniz algebra. Finally, given a proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and a deformation map $r$, we construct two governing $L_\infty$-algebras, the first one controls the deformations of the operator $r$ while the second one controls the simultaneous deformations of both the proto-twilled Leibniz algebra and the operator $r$.</description>

      <title>The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>
