      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis: Past, Present and a Letter Through Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a "Letter to Riemann," using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Colored interlacing triangles and Genocchi medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colored interlacing triangles, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler (2024), provide the combinatorial framework for the Central Limit Theorem for probability measures arising from the Lascoux-Leclerc-Thibon (LLT) polynomials. Colored interlacing triangles depend on two key parameters: the number of colors $n$ and the depth of the triangle $N$. Recent work of Gaetz-Gao (2025) connects these objects to Schubert calculus and resolves the enumeration for $n=3$ and arbitrary depth $N$. However, the enumerative behavior for general $n$ has remained open.
  In this paper, we analyze the complementary regime: fixed depth $N=2$ and arbitrary number of colors $n$. We prove that in this setting, colored interlacing triangles are in bijection with Dumont derangements, identifying their enumeration with the Genocchi medians. This connects the probabilistic model to a rich hierarchy of classical combinatorial objects.
  Furthermore, we introduce a $q$-deformation of this enumeration arising naturally from the LLT transition energy. This yields new $q$-analogs of the Genocchi medians. Finally, we present computational results and sampling algorithms for colored interlacing triangles with higher $N$ or $n$, which suggests the limits of combinatorial tractability in the $(N,n)$ parameter space.</description>

      <title>On the Approximation of the Quantum Gates using Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.05785v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in Quantum Computing is how matrices in $SU(2)$ can be approximated by products over a small set of generators. A topology will be defined on $SU(2)$ so as to introduce the notion of a covering exponent which compares the length of products required to covering $SU(2)$ with $\varepsilon$ balls against the Haar measure of $\varepsilon$ balls. An efficient universal set over $PSU(2)$ will be constructed using the Pauli matrices, using the metric of the covering exponent. Then, the relationship between $SU(2)$ and $S^3$ will be manipulated to correlate angles between points on $S^3$ to give a conjecture on the maximum of angles between points on a lattice. It will be shown how this conjecture can be used to compute the covering exponent. Some extensions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dualities of dihedral and generalised quaternion codes and applications to quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of $q$ elements, for some prime power $q$, and let $G$ be a finite group. A (left) group code, or simply a $G$-code, is a (left) ideal of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $n$ not divisible by char$(\mathbb{F}_{q^2})$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ not divisible by char$(\mathbb{F}_q)$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach.</description>
