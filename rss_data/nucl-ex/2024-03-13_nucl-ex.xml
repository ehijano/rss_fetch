      <title>First identification of a doublet wobbling excitation mode in $^{105}$Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of $^{105}$Pd has revealed, for the first time, the existence of two wobbling bands both having one phonon configuration and originating from the coupling of the wobbling phonon to the ground state band and to its signature partner. The doublet one-phonon wobbling bands are, in turn, found to be the signature partner bands. These observations have been drawn from the measured ratios of the inter-band and intra-band gamma transition rates. The model calculations based on the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach have been performed and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations. These calculations provide an insight into the nature of the observed structures at a microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) are a fundamental and elegant way to describe the structure of nucleons and nuclei. Their Fourier transform allows a description of the spatial distribution of the mass, angular momentum, pressure, and shear force densities for both quarks and gluons in the nucleon. While previous investigations predominantly focused on the proton electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) leading to the charge and magnetization distributions determination, the current emphasis has shifted towards expanding our understanding of the gravitational form factors of quarks and gluons where little is known. In particular, more recently, the proton {\it gluonic} GFFs have been the target of an intensive investigation at Jefferson Lab. This endeavor, is not without its challenges, particularly in navigating the complexities associated with the near-threshold region. Nevertheless, it provides a bedrock for future nucleon and nuclei gluonic structure studies at the future EIC. In this talk, I will focus on the recent results of $J/\psi$ photoproduction near-threshold on the proton at Jefferson Lab to determine, in particular, the elusive {\it gluonic} gravitational form factors. We discuss the caveats of their extraction in the threshold region and mention the complementary measurements of $\Upsilon$ at the EIC critical to access the trace anomaly and gain insight into the origin of the nucleon mass.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo algorithm for calculating pre-neutron fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions from measurements using the 2E Technique for reaction 235U(nth, f)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed that enables the calculation of pre-neutron mass and energy distributions of fission fragments from uranium-235, induced by thermal neutrons, utilizing measurements obtained through the 2E technique. This algorithm facilitates the inference of the curve representing the average multiplicity of prompt neutrons relative to the pre-neutron mass of the fission fragments.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Suppression of diffraction in deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei and dynamical mechanism of leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the leading twist approach (LTA) to nuclear shadowing, we calculate the ratios of diffractive and usual parton distributions for a heavy nucleus (Pb) and the proton, $R_{A/p}=(f_{i/A}^{D(3)}/f_{i/A})/(f_{i/p}^{D(3)}/f_{i/p})$, for coherent and summed (coherent plus quasi-elastic) nuclear deep-inelastic scattering. We find that $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1$ for quarks and $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1.3$ for gluons in a broad range of $x$, which reaffirms the difference from the nuclear enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ predicted in the gluon saturation framework. We demonstrate that the magnitude of $R_{A/p}$ is controlled by the cross section of the interaction of hadronic fluctuations of the virtual photon with target nucleons, which explains an enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ in the color dipole model and its suppression in LTA. We argue that the black disk limit of LTA corresponds to $R_{A/p}=1$ and $R^{\rm coh}_{A/p}=0.86$ for the summed and coherent scattering, respectively. Relying on an intuitive definition of the saturation scale, we show that the ratio of the saturation scales of a heavy nucleus and proton $Q_{sA}^2(b)/Q_{sp}^2(b) \approx 1$ at small impact parameters $b$ due to the strong leading twist nuclear shadowing and diluteness of the nuclear density.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and open questions in modern $\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For well over half a century, precision studies of neutron and nuclear $\beta$ decays have been at the forefront of searches for exotic electroweak physics. Recent advances in nuclear ab initio theory and the widespread use of effective field theories means that its modern understanding is going through a transitional phase. This has been propelled by current tensions in the global data set leading to renewed scrutiny of its theoretical ingredients. In parallel, a host of novel techniques and methods are being investigated that are able to sidestep many traditional systematic uncertainties and require a diverse palette of skills and collaboration with material science and condensed matter physics. We highlight the current opportunities and open questions with the aim of facilitating the transition to a more modern understanding of $\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Target mass corrections in lepton--nucleus DIS: theory and applications to nuclear PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide range of kinematics covered by current and planned deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) facilities, we revisit the formalism, practical implementation, and numerical impact of target mass corrections (TMCs) for DIS on unpolarized nuclear targets. An important aspect is that we only use nuclear and later partonic degrees of freedom, carefully avoiding a picture of the nucleus in terms of nucleons. After establishing that formulae used for individual nucleon targets $(p,n)$, derived in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) formalism, are indeed applicable to nuclear targets, we rewrite expressions for nuclear TMCs in terms of \mbox{re-scaled} (or averaged) kinematic variables. As a consequence, we find a representation for nuclear TMCs that is approximately independent of the nuclear target. We go on to construct a single-parameter fit for all nuclear targets that is in good numerical agreement with full computations of TMCs. We discuss in detail qualitative and quantitative differences between nuclear TMCs built in the OPE and the parton model formalisms, as well as give numerical predictions for current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Production of true para-muonium in linearly polarized photon fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: True muonium (TM) -- the bound state of $\mu^+\mu^-$ -- has not been discovered yet. It was demonstrated that searching for TM via $\gamma\gamma$ fusions in heavy ion collisions is feasible due to the enhancement of the atom number. We study the production of the true para-muonium (pTM) in the collisions of linearly polarized photons in the experiments of heavy-ion collisions, calculate the production rate as well as the transverse spectrum of pTM, and explore the discovery potential in nuclear experiments. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the linearly polarized photon distribution and the transverse momentum distribution of pTM. The optimal kinematic region of the generated pTM is identified, which can provide a theoretical guide to the detection of pTM in experiments.</description>
