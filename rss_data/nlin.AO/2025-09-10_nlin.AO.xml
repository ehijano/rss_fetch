      <title>Hybrid Galam--Bass Model for Technology Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid model that combines the Galam model of opinion dynamics with the Bass diffusion model used in technology adoption on Barabasi-Albert complex networks. The main idea is to advance a version of the Bass model that can suitably describe an opinion formation context while introducing irreversible transitions from group B (opponents) to group A (supporters). Moreover, we extend the model to take into account the presence of a charismatic competitor, which fosters conversion back to the old technology. The approach is different from the introduction of a mean field due to the interactions driven by the network structure. Additionally, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy to quantify the system's unpredictability and information loss over time. The results show an increase in the regularity of the trajectories as the preferential attachment parameter increases.</description>

      <title>GRASPion: an Open-Source, Programmable Brainbot for Active Matter Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the GRASPion, a compact, open-source bristlebot designed for the controlled study of active matter systems. Built around a low-cost Arduino-compatible board and modular 3D-printed components, the GRASPion combines ease of use, programmability, and mechanical versatility. It features dual vibrating motors for self-propulsion, integrated sensors for local interaction, and customizable firmware enabling various motion modes, from ballistic to diffusive regimes. The robot is equipped with onboard IR communication, color and proximity sensors, and a magnetometer, allowing for real-time interaction and complex collective behaviors. With a runtime exceeding 90 minutes and reproducible fabrication, the GRASPion provides a robust and scalable platform for both educational and research applications in out-of-equilibrium physics. This article details the mechanical and electronic design and software architecture of the GRASPion, and illustrates its capabilities through prototypical experiments relevant to active matter.</description>

      <title>Route to Chaos in Multi-Species Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate species-rich mathematical models of ecosystems. While much of the existing literature focuses on the properties of equilibrium fixed points, persistent dynamics (e.g., limit cycles or chaos) have also been observed, both in natural or lab-controlled ecosystems and in mathematical models. Here we emphasize the emergence of limit cycles following Hopf bifurcations tuned by the variability of interspecies interaction. As this variability increases, and owing to the large dimensionality of the system, limit cycles typically acquire a growing spectrum of frequencies. This often leads to the appearance of strange attractors, with a chaotic dynamics of species abundances characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent. We observe that limit cycles and strange attractors preserve biodiversity to some extent, as they maintain dynamical stability without species extinction. We give numerical evidences that this route to chaos dominates in ecosystems with strong enough interactions and where predator-prey behavior dominates over competition and mutualism. Based on arguments from random matrix theory, we further conjecture that this scenario is generic in ecosystems with large number of species, and identify the key parameters driving it. Overall, we show that the model we consider provides a unifying framework, where a wide range of population dynamics emerge from a simple few-parameter model.</description>
