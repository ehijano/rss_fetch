      <title>Safety Monitor for Off-Road Planning with Uncertainty Bounded Bekker Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable off-road autonomy requires operational constraints so that behavior stays predictable and safe when soil strength is uncertain. This paper presents a runtime assurance safety monitor that collaborates with any planner and uses a Bekker-based cost model with bounded uncertainty. The monitor builds an upper confidence traversal cost from a lightweight pressure sinkage model identified in field tests and checks each planned motion against two limits: maximum sinkage and rollover margin. If the risk of crossing either limit is too high, the monitor switches to a certified fallback that reduces vehicle speed, increases standoff from soft ground, or stops on firmer soil. This separation lets the planner focus on efficiency while the monitor keeps the vehicle within clear safety limits on board. Wheel geometry, wheel load estimate, and a soil raster serve as inputs, which tie safety directly to vehicle design and let the monitor set clear limits on speed, curvature, and stopping at run time. The method carries uncertainty analytically into the upper confidence cost and applies simple intervention rules. Tuning of the sinkage limit, rollover margin, and risk window trades efficiency for caution while keeping the monitor light enough for embedded processors. Results from a simulation environment spanning loam to sand include intervention rates, violation probability, and path efficiency relative to the nominal plan, and a benchtop static loading check provides initial empirical validation.</description>

      <title>A Connectively Stable and Robust DAPI Control Scheme for Islanded Networks of Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are giving rise to the emergence of Microgrids (MGs) and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode. However, they face challenges in terms of secondary level frequency and voltage regulation, due to the variable nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and loads. Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control has been proposed in the literature for distributed frequency and voltage control of droop-controlled DERs, but it is not robust to operational or structural perturbations. To address this, we propose a robust DAPI frequency and voltage control scheme that ensures robustness using the concept of connective stability, along with the invariant ellipsoid technique for disturbance rejection. Simulation of an NMG model in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} consisting of 3 MGs and 5 DERs validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, and demonstrates that it can successfully mitigate the effects of major disturbances such as cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>House Thermal Model Estimation: Robustness Across Seasons and Setpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving the flexibility from house heating, cooling, and ventilation systems (HVAC) has the potential to enable large-scale demand response by aggregating HVAC load adjustments across many homes. This demand response strategy helps distribution grid to flexibly ramp-up or ramp-down local load demand so that it can optimally match the bulk power system generation profile. However, achieving this capability requires house thermal models that are both computationally efficient and robust to operating conditions. In this work, parameters of the Resistance-Capacitance (RC) network thermal model for houses are estimated using three optimization algorithms: Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), Batch Estimation (BE), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). The resulting models are evaluated through a Forward-Simulation across four different seasons and three setpoints. The results illustrate a principled way of selecting reduced order models and estimation methods with respect to the robustness offered to seasonal and setpoint variations in training-testing datasets</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Physics-Informed Deep Neural Networks with Skew Symmetry Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful black-box function approximators which have been shown to yield improved performance compared to traditional neural network (NN) architectures. However, black-box algorithms do not incorporate known physics of the system and can yield results which are physically implausible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity due to their ability to leverage known physical principles in the learning process which has been empirically shown to improve performance compared to traditional black-box methods. This paper introduces the first physics-informed DNN controller for an Euler-Lagrange dynamic system where the adaptation laws are designed using a Lyapunov-based stability analysis to account for the skew-symmetry property of the inertia matrix and centripetal-Coriolis matrix. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotic convergence of the tracking error and the skew-symmetric prediction error. Simulations indicate that the developed update law demonstrates improvement in individual and overall function approximation capabilities when compared to a physics-informed adaptation law which does not incorporate knowledge of system symmetries.</description>

      <title>Environment-Dependent Components Identification of Behind-the-Meter Resources via Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, it is vital to monitor the components of these resources and deduce their response behavior to external environment. Owing to data privacy, however, the appliance-wise measurement is invisible to the power system operator, which hinders the accurate modeling of load identification. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid physics-inspired and data-driven framework for decomposing BTM components based on external measurement of total load and environmental factors. The total load is decomposed into different environment-dependent components, namely storage-like component, PV generation component, thermostatically-controlled load component, and periodic component. The overall load identification adopts a double-layer iterative solution framework. A data-driven inverse optimization algorithm is developed to identify parameters of the energy storage-like component. The physics-inspired model is proposed to identify the capacity and response of the rest components. The modeling accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated by numerical tests. The application significance of the proposed BTM identification method is also validated in electricity market clearing for reducing system operation costs.</description>

      <title>Green Hydrogen under Uncertainty: Evaluating Power-to-X Strategies Using Agent-Based Simulation and Multi-Criteria Decision Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation. Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW) within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning. Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in renewable-rich contexts.</description>

      <title>The Role of Information Incompleteness in Defending Against Stealth Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Data Injections Attacks (DIAs) critically depends on the completeness of the system information accessible to adversaries. This relationship positions information incompleteness enhancement as a vital defense strategy for degrading DIA performance. In this paper, we focus on the information-theoretic stealth attacks, where the attacker encounters a fundamental tradeoff between the attack stealthiness and destructiveness. Specifically, we systematically characterize how incomplete admittance information impacts the dual objectives. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for two distinct operational regimes: (i) stealthiness intensifies while destructive potential diminishes and (ii) destructiveness increases while stealth capability weakens. For scenarios beyond these regimes, we propose a maximal incompleteness strategy to optimally degrade stealth capability. To solve the associated optimization problem, the feasible region is reduced without excluding the optimal solution, and a heuristic algorithm is then introduced to effectively identify the near-optimal solutions within the reduced region. Numerical simulations are conducted on IEEE test systems to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for MIMO Beam Map and Environment Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable, geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS) data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB package called the Pha-sorArray Toolbox that has been developed to make harmonic analysis and control methods both practical and user-friendly. The toolbox adopts an object-oriented architecture that enables intuitive manipulation of periodic matrices through overloaded operators for addition, multiplication, convolution, and automatic Toeplitz construction. Its advanced features include harmonic Sylvester, Lyapunov and Riccati equations solvers, and seamless integration with YALMIP, thereby facilitating advanced control and analysis techniques based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) in the harmonic framework.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Koopman MPC using Mixed Stochastic-Deterministic Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven stochastic MPC design for discrete-time nonlinear systems with additive disturbances by leveraging the Koopman operator and a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework. By lifting the dynamical system into a linear space, we achieve a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. We explicitly account for the modeling approximation and additive disturbance error by a mixed stochastic-deterministic tube for the lifted linear model. This ensures the regulation of the original nonlinear system while complying with the prespecified constraints. Stochastic and deterministic tubes are constructed using a DRO and a hyper-cube hull, respectively. We provide finite sample error bounds for both types of tubes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Predictive control barrier functions for piecewise affine systems with non-smooth constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining control barrier functions (CBFs) with large safe sets for complex nonlinear systems and constraints is a challenging task. Predictive CBFs address this issue by using an online finite-horizon optimal control problem that implicitly defines a large safe set. The optimal control problem, also known as the predictive safety filter (PSF), involves predicting the system's flow under a given backup control policy. However, for non-smooth systems and constraints, some key elements, such as CBF gradients and the sensitivity of the flow, are not well-defined, making the current methods inadequate for ensuring safety. Additionally, for control-non-affine systems, the PSF is generally nonlinear and non-convex, posing challenges for real-time computation. This paper considers piecewise affine systems, which are usually control-non-affine, under nonlinear state and polyhedral input constraints. We solve the safety issue by incorporating set-valued generalized Clarke derivatives in the PSF design. We show that enforcing CBF constraints across all elements of the generalized Clarke derivatives suffices to guarantee safety. Moreover, to lighten the computational overhead, we propose an explicit approximation of the PSF. The resulting control methods are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Auction-Based Responsibility Allocation for Scalable Decentralized Safety Filters in Cooperative Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable decentralized safety filter for multi-agent systems based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) and auction-based responsibility allocation. While decentralized HOCBF formulations ensure pairwise safety under input bounds, they face feasibility and scalability challenges as the number of agents grows. Each agent must evaluate an increasing number of pairwise constraints, raising the risk of infeasibility and making it difficult to meet real-time requirements. To address this, we introduce an auction-based allocation scheme that distributes constraint enforcement asymmetrically among neighbors based on local control effort estimates. The resulting directed responsibility graph guarantees full safety coverage while reducing redundant constraints and per-agent computational load. Simulation results confirm safe and efficient coordination across a range of network sizes and interaction densities.</description>

      <title>System-Theoretic Analysis of Dynamic Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problems -- Turnpikes and Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibria are used in multi-agent control applications to model strategic interactions between agents that are coupled in the cost, dynamics, and constraints. We study the properties of open-loop GNE trajectories from a system-theoretic perspective. We show how strict dissipativity generates the turnpike phenomenon in GNE solutions. Moreover, we establish a converse turnpike result, i.e., the implication from turnpike to strict dissipativity. We derive conditions under which the steady-state GNE is the optimal operating point and, using a game value function, we give a local characterization of the geometry of storage functions. Finally, we design linear terminal penalties that ensure GNE open-loop trajectories converge to and remain at the steady-state GNE. These connections provide the foundation for future system-theoretic analysis of GNEs similar to those existing in optimal control.</description>

      <title>Rate-cost tradeoffs in continuous-time control with a biomolecular application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on rate-limited control of the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where the control action can be either multiplicative or additive, and the noise variance can depend on the control action. We derive a lower bound on the data rate necessary to achieve the desired control cost. The lower bound is attained with equality if the control is performed via an additive white Gaussian channel. The system model approximates the dynamics of a discrete-state molecular birth-death process, and the result has direct implications on the control of a biomolecular system via chemical reactions, where the multiplicative control corresponds to the degradation rate, the additive control corresponds to the production rate, and the control objective is to decrease the fluctuations of the controlled molecular species around their desired concentration levels.</description>

      <title>Aircraft Collision Avoidance Systems: Technological Challenges and Solutions on the Path to Regulatory Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aircraft collision avoidance systems is critical to modern aviation. These systems are designed to predict potential collisions between aircraft and recommend appropriate avoidance actions. Creating effective collision avoidance systems requires solutions to a variety of technical challenges related to surveillance, decision making, and validation. These challenges have sparked significant research and development efforts over the past several decades that have resulted in a variety of proposed solutions. This article provides an overview of these challenges and solutions with an emphasis on those that have been put through a rigorous validation process and accepted by regulatory bodies. The challenges posed by the collision avoidance problem are often present in other domains, and aircraft collision avoidance systems can serve as case studies that provide valuable insights for a wide range of safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>The local Gaussian correlation networks among return tails in the Chinese stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation. The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality, average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the local Gaussian correlation method.</description>

      <title>Robust Regret Control with Uncertainty-Dependent Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust regret control framework in which the performance baseline adapts to the realization of system uncertainty. The plant is modeled as a discrete-time, uncertain linear time-invariant system with real-parametric uncertainty. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal controller constructed with full knowledge of the disturbance and the specific realization of the uncertain plant. We show that a controller achieves robust additive regret relative to this baseline if and only if it satisfies a related, robust $H_\infty$ performance condition on a modified plant. One technical issue is that the modified plant can, in general, have a complicated nonlinear dependence on the uncertainty. We use a linear approximation step so that the robust additive regret condition can be recast as a standard $\mu$-synthesis problem. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Synthesis of Switched Optimization Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deployment of optimization algorithms on networked systems face challenges associated with time delays and corruptions. One particular instance is the presence of time-varying delays arising from factors such as packet drops and irregular sampling. Fixed time delays can destabilize gradient descent algorithms, and this degradation is exacerbated by time-varying delays. This work concentrates on the analysis and creation of discrete-time optimization algorithms with certified exponential convergence rates that are robust against switched uncertainties between the optimizer and the gradient oracle. These optimization algorithms are implemented by a switch-scheduled output feedback controllers. Rate variation and sawtooth behavior (packet drops) in time-varying delays can be imposed through constraining switching sequences. Analysis is accomplished by bisection in the convergence rate to find Zames-Falb filter coefficents. Synthesis is performed by alternating between a filter coefficient search for a fixed controller, and a controller search for fixed multipliers.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Prediction-Based Individualized Driver Warning System to Reduce Red Light Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red light violation is a major cause of traffic collisions and resulting injuries and fatalities. Despite extensive prior work to reduce red light violations, they continue to be a major problem in practice, partly because existing systems suffer from the flaw of providing the same guidance to all drivers. As a result, some violations are avoided, but other drivers ignore or respond inappropriately to red light running systems, resulting in safety issues overall. We show a method of providing accurate warnings to individual drivers to avoid the broad guidance approach of most existing systems. Recognizing if a driver will run red lights is highly dependent on signal phase and timing, traffic conditions along the road, and individual driver behaviour, the proposed warning system contains three parts: a traffic prediction algorithm, an individual warning signal optimizer, and a driver warning display. The traffic prediction algorithm predicts future traffic states along the road towards the signalized intersections using the latest traffic conditions obtained through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to compute the optimal warning signal based on predicted traffic states and driver reaction model. Finally, the optimal warning signal is shown on the display screen to advise driver on how much braking is needed to avoid running the red light. The system continuously updates the latest warning signal as the vehicle is approaching the intersection. Both numerical simulated driving scenarios and real-world road tests are used to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance under different conditions by comparing with previous work on red light running warning system. The results show that the system provides more effective and accurate warning signals to drivers, helping them avoid running red lights.</description>

      <title>Operational Risks in Grid Integration of Large Data Center Loads: Characteristics, Stability Assessments, and Sensitivity Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</description>

      <title>A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08943v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input, proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not of full row rank, which also results in a potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon, discrete, discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.</description>

      <title>Robust time series generation via Schr\"odinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</description>

      <title>MESS+: Dynamically Learned Inference-Time LLM Routing in Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Dynamic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Mechanism in Unknown Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon average-reward Markov decision process (MDP). In each round, the seller determines an allocation and sets a payment for each bidder, while each bidder receives a private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition kernel and the seller's allocation policy without episodic resets. We first extend the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to sequential auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic counterpart that preserves the desired properties: efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality. We then focus on the online setting and develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying MDP and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG mechanism. We show that the learned mechanism approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness, and individual rationality and achieves guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy, while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance, security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware software co design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications, featuring an energy aware protocol stack. The architecture employs a multicast, clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores, historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized throughput. Security is ensured through a zero trust model that fuses cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3 simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable foundation for high performance swarm operations.</description>
