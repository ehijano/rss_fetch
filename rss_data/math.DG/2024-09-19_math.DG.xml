      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use variational methods to construct a free boundary minimal surface in the three-dimensional unit ball with genus one, two boundary components and prismatic symmetry. Key ingredients are an extension of the equivariant min-max theory to include orientation-reversing isometries and the discovery of a nontrivial two-parameter sweepout.</description>

      <title>A 4-point theorem: still another variation on an old theme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An old theorem, due to Graustein, asserts that the average curvature of a plane oval is attained at least at four points. We present a proof by way of wave propagation and extend this result to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries - in the latter case, to horocyclically convex curves only.</description>

      <title>Weakly Einstein hypersurfaces in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is called \emph{weakly Einstein} if the tensor $R_{iabc}R_{j}^{~~abc}$ is a scalar multiple of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$. We give a complete classification of weakly Einstein hypersurfaces in the spaces of nonzero constant curvature (the classification in a Euclidean space has been previously known). The main result states that such a hypersurface can only be the product of two spaces of constant curvature or a rotation hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Stability of the area preserving mean curvature flow in asymptotic Schwarzschild space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first demonstrate that the area preserving mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces in space forms exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a round sphere if the integral of the traceless second fundamental form is sufficiently small. Then we show that from sufficiently large initial coordinate sphere, the area preserving mean curvature flow exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to a constant mean curvature surface in 3-dimensional asymptotically Schwarzschild spaces. This provides a new approach to the existence of foliation established by Huisken and Yau. And also a uniqueness result follows</description>

      <title>Flat extensions and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new parabolic flow deforming any Riemannian metric on a spin manifold by following a constrained gradient flow of the total scalar curvature. This flow is built out of the well-known Dirac-Einstein functional. We prove local well-posedness of smooth solutions. The present contribution is the first installment of more general program on the Einstein-Dirac problem.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl problem for complete surfaces in the hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Weyl problem (solved by Lewy, Alexandrov, Pogorelov, and others) asks whether any metric of curvature $K\geq 0$ on the sphere is induced on the boundary of a unique convex body in $\R^3$. The answer was extended to surfaces in hyperbolic space by Alexandrov in the 1950s, and a ``dual'' statement, describing convex bodies in terms of the third fundamental form of their boundary (e.g. their dihedral angles, for an ideal polyhedron) was later proved.
  We describe three conjectural generalizations of the Weyl problem in $\HH^3$ and its dual to unbounded convex subsets and convex surfaces, in ways that are relevant to contemporary geometry since a number of recent results and well-known open problems can be considered as special cases. One focus is on convex domain having a ``thin'' asymptotic boundary, for instance a quasicircle -- this part of the problem is strongly related to the theory of Kleinian groups. A second direction is towards convex subsets with a ``thick'' ideal boundary, for instance a disjoint union of disks -- here one find connections to problems in complex analysis, such as the Koebe circle domain conjecture. A third direction is towards complete, convex disks of infinite area in $\HH^3$ and surfaces in hyperbolic ends -- with connections to questions on circle packings or grafting on the hyperbolic disk. Similar statements are proposed in anti-de Sitter geometry, a Lorentzian cousin of hyperbolic geometry where interesting new phenomena can occur, and in Minkowski and Half-pipe geometry. We also collect some partial new results mostly based on recent works.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic expansion of the spacetime metric at the event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking's local rigidity theorem, proven in the smooth setting by Alexakis-Ionescu-Klainerman, says that the event horizon of any stationary non-extremal black hole is a non-degenerate Killing horizon. In this paper, we prove that the full asymptotic expansion of any smooth vacuum metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon is determined by the geometry of the horizon. This gives a new perspective on the black hole uniqueness conjecture. In spacetime dimension $4$, we also prove an existence theorem: Given any non-degenerate horizon geometry, Einstein's vacuum equations can be solved to infinite order at the horizon in a unique way (up to isometry). The latter is a gauge invariant version of Moncrief's classical existence result, without any restriction on the topology of the horizon. In the real analytic setting, the asymptotic expansion is shown to converge and we get well-posedness of this characteristic Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>A note on rational homology vanishing theorem for hypersurfaces in aspherical manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we generalize Gromov's reduction \cite{Gro20} from the aspherical conjecture to the generalized filling radius conjecture to the smooth $\mathbb Q$-homology vanishing conjecture for hypersurface. In particular, we can show that any continuous map from a closed $4$-manifold admitting positive scalar curvature to an aspherical $5$-manifold induces zero map in $H_4(\cdot,\mathbb Q)$. As a corollary, we obtain the following splitting theorem: if a complete aspherical $5$-manifold has nonnegative scalar curvature and two ends, then it splits into the Riemannian product of a closed flat manifold and the real line.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. In this paper we study the existence of constant weighted scalar curvature K\"ahler (weighted cscK) metrics on $X$. More precisely, we establish a priori $C^{k}$-estimates ($k\geq 0$) for the K\"ahler potential associated with these metrics, thereby extending a result due to Chen and Cheng in the classical cscK setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

Abstract: We apply methods of algebraic integral geometry to prove a special case of the Gaussian kinematic formula of Adler-Taylor.

      <title>Isomonodromic and isospectral deformations of meromorphic connections: the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-twisted meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and the associated symplectic Hamiltonian structure. In particular, we provide explicit expressions of the Lax pair in the geometric gauge supplementing previous results where explicit formulas have been obtained in the oper gauge. Expressing the geometric Lax matrices requires the introduction of specific Darboux coordinates for which we provide the explicit Hamiltonian evolutions. These expressions allow to build bridges between the isomonodromic deformations and the isospectral ones. More specifically, we propose an explicit change of Darboux coordinates to obtain isospectral coordinates for which Hamiltonians match the spectral invariants. This result solves the issue left opened in \cite{BertolaHarnadHurtubise2022} in the case of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>112 years of listening to Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1910, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz delved into the enigmatic Laplace eigenvalue equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, pondering to what extent the geometry in which one solves the equation can be recovered from knowledge of the eigenvalues. Lorentz, inspired by physical and musical analogies, conjectured a fundamental relationship between eigenvalues, domain volume, and dimensionality. While his conjecture initially seemed insurmountable, Hermann Weyl's groundbreaking proof in 1912 illuminated the deep connection between eigenvalues and geometric properties. Over the ensuing 112 years, mathematicians and physicists have continued to decipher the intricate interplay between eigenvalues and geometry. From Weyl's law to Milnor's example of isospectral non-isometric flat tori, and Kac's inspiring question about hearing the shape of a drum, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, uncovering spectral invariants and advancing our understanding of geometric properties discernible through eigenvalues. We present an overview of this field amenable to both physicists and mathematicians.</description>
