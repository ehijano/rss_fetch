      <title>Transonic shocks for steady Euler flows with an external force in an axisymmetric perturbed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We concern the structural stability of transonic shocks for the steady Euler system with an external force in an axisymmetric perturbed cylinder. For a class of external forces, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of the transonic shock solution to the one-dimensional steady Euler system with an external force, which shows that the external force has a stabilization effect on the transonic shock in the flat cylinder and the shock position is uniquely determined. We then establish the existence and stability of the transonic shock solution under axisymmetric perturbations of the incoming supersonic flow, the nozzle boundary, the exit pressure and the external force. Different from the transonic shock problem in two-dimensional nozzles, there exists a singularity along the symmetric axis for axisymmetric flows. We introduce an invertible modified Lagrangian transformation to overcome this difficulty and straighten the streamline. One of the key elements in the analysis is to utilize the deformation-curl decomposition to effectively decouple the hyperbolic and elliptic modes in the steady axisymmetric Euler system with an external force. Another one is an equivalent reformulation of the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions so that the shock front is uniquely determined by an algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>Thin-film limit of the Ginzburg-Landau heat flow in a curved thin domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Ginzburg-Landau heat flow without magnetic effect in a curved thin domain under the Naumann boundary condition. When the curved thin domain shrinks to a given closed hypersurface as the thickness of the thin domain tends to zero, we show that the weighted average of a weak solution to the thin-domain problem converges weakly on the limit surface under the assumption that the initial data is of class $L^\infty$ and satisfies some conditions. Moreover, under the same assumption, we derive a limit equation by characterizing the limit function as a weak solution, and prove a difference estimate on the limit surface of an averaged weak solution to the thin-domain problem and a weak solution to the limit problem explicitly in terms of the thickness of the thin domain. We also derive a difference estimate in the curved thin domain of weak solutions to the thin-domain problem and to the limit problem, but without requiring that the initial data of the thin-domain problem is of class $L^\infty$.</description>

      <title>Sharp ill-posedness for the non-resistive MHD equations in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a sharp ill-posedness result for the incompressible non-resistive MHD equations. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we show the ill-posedness of the non-resistive MHD equations in $H^{\frac{d}{2}-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times H^{\frac{d}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which is sharp in view of the results of the local well-posedness in $H^{s-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^d)(s&gt;\frac{d}{2})$ established by Fefferman et al.(Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., \textbf{223} (2), 677-691, 2017). Furthermore, we generalize the ill-posedness results from $H^{\frac{d}{2}-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times H^{\frac{d}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to Besov spaces $B^{\frac{d}{p}-1}_{p, q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times B^{\frac{d}{p}}_{p, q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $\dot B^{\frac{d}{p}-1}_{p, q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times \dot B^{\frac{d}{p}}_{p, q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $1\le p\le\infty, q&gt;1$. Different from the ill-posedness mechanism of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\dot B^{-1}_{\infty, q}$ \cite{B,W}, we construct an initial data such that the paraproduct terms (low-high frequency interaction) of the nonlinear term make the main contribution to the norm inflation of the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A doubly degenerate parabolic equation in non-divergent form with variable growth is investigated in this paper. In suitable spaces, we prove the existence of weak solutions of the equation for cases $1\leq m &lt; 2$ and $m\geq 2$ in different ways. And we establish the non-expansion of support of the solution for the problem.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the slip-length and on the Prandtl number, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

      <title>Sharp quasi-invariance threshold for the cubic Szeg\H{o} equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 1-dimensional cubic Szeg\H{o} equation with data distributed according to the Gaussian measure with inverse covariance operator $(1-\partial_x^2)^\frac s2$, where $s&gt;\frac12$. We show that, for $s&gt;1$, this measure is quasi-invariant under the flow of the equation, while for $s&lt;1$, $s\neq \frac34$, the transported measure and the initial Gaussian measure are mutually singular for almost every time. This is the first observation of a transition from quasi-invariance to singularity in the context of the transport of Gaussian measures under the flow of Hamiltonian PDEs.</description>

      <title>Non-Positivity of the heat equation with non-local Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heat equations $\partial_t u + Lu = 0$ on bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$, where $L=-\operatorname{div}(A\nabla\;\cdot\;)$ is a second-order uniformly elliptic operator with generalised Robin boundary conditions of the form $\nu\cdot A\nabla u + Bu=0$, where $B\in\mathcal{L}(L^2(\partial\Omega))$ is a general operator. In contrast to large parts of the literature on non-local Robin boundary conditions we also allow for operators $B$ that destroy the positivity preserving property of the solution semigroup $(e^{-tL})_{t\ge 0}$. Nevertheless, we obtain ultracontractivity of the semigroup under quite mild assumptions on $B$. For a certain class of operators $B$ we demonstrate that the semigroup is in fact eventually positive rather than positivity preserving.</description>

      <title>Heat flow, log-concavity, and Lipschitz transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive estimates for the Hessian of the logarithm (log-Hessian) for solutions to the heat equation. For initial data in the form of log-Lipschitz perturbation of strongly log-concave measures, the log-Hessian admits an explicit, uniform (in space) lower bound. This yields a new estimate for the Lipschitz constant of a transport map pushing forward the standard Gaussian to a measure in this class. Further connections are discussed with score-based diffusion models and improved Gaussian logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we show that assuming only fast decay of the tails of the initial datum does not suffice to guarantee uniform log-Hessian upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a novel nonlocal model for cell-cell adhesion via receptor binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local well-posedness is established for a highly nonlocal nonlinear diffusion-adhesion system for bounded initial values with small support. Macroscopic systems of this kind were previously obtained by the authors through upscaling in [32] and can account for the effect of microscopic receptor binding dynamics in cell-cell adhesion. The system analysed here couples an integro-PDE featuring degenerate diffusion of the porous media type and nonlocal adhesion with a novel nonlinear integral equation. The approach is based on decoupling the system and using Banach's fixed point theorem to solve each of the two equations individually and subsequently the entire system. The main challenge of the implementation lies in selecting a suitable framework. One of the key results is the local well-posedness for the integral equation with a Radon measure as a parameter. The analysis of this equation utilizes the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, marking the first application of this norm in handling a nonlinear integral equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic expansions of the Euclidean $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature regime. In particular, this extends the asymptotic expansions of Gaussian function space integrals developed in Schilder (1966) and Ellis and Rosen (1982) to the singular setting, where the field is no longer a function, but just a distribution. As a consequence, we deduce limit theorems, specifically the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Localized Multi-Dimensional Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <title>An algebraic-geometric construction of "lump" solutions of the KP1 equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation ("multi-lumps") can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta functions from singular rational curves with cusps. The method we use can be understood as producing a degeneration of the well-understood soliton solutions from nodal singular curves. Hence it can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. We present an explicit example of a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup $\langle 2,5\rangle$. (In the theory of curve singularities, these are known as $A_4$ double points.) We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar $M$-lump solutions with $M = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ for $N &gt; 2$ starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup $\langle 2,2N+1\rangle$ ($A_{2N}$ double points). Similar solutions have been constructed by other methods previously; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in previous work of Agostini, Celik, and Little.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates and fluctuations for the Stokes-Brinkman equations as homogenization limit in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.04111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ perforated by $m$ spherical particles. We assume the positions and velocities of the particles to be identically and independently distributed random variables. In the critical regime, when the radii of the particles are of order $m^{-1}$, the homogenization limit $u$ is given as the solution to the Brinkman equations. We provide optimal rates for the convergence $u_m \to u$ in $L^2$, namely $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta &lt; 1/2$. Moreover, we consider the fluctuations. In the central limit scaling, we show that these converge to a Gaussian field, locally in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$, with an explicit covariance.
  Our analysis is based on explicit approximations for the solutions $u_m$ in terms of $u$ as well as the particle positions and their velocities. These are shown to be accurate in $\dot H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ to order $m^{-\beta}$ for all $\beta &lt; 1$. Our results also apply to the analogous problem regarding the homogenization of the Poisson equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of sharp fronts: Analysis and rigorous computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of traveling front solutions to nonlinear diffusive-dispersive equations of Burgers type, with a primary focus on the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdVB) equation, although our analytical findings extend more broadly. Manipulating the temporal modulation of the translation parameter of the front and employing the energy method, we establish asymptotic, nonlinear, and orbital stability, provided that an auxiliary Schr\"odinger equation possesses precisely one bound state. Notably, our result is independent of the monotonicity of the profile and does not necessitate the initial condition to be close to the front. We identify a sufficient condition for stability based on a functional that characterizes the 'width' of the traveling wave profile. Analytical verification for the KdVB equation confirms that this sufficient condition holds for the relative dispersion parameter within an open interval $\nu \in [-0.25,0.25]$, encompassing all monotone profiles. Utilizing validated numerics or rigorous computation, we present acomputer-assisted proof demonstrating that the stability condition itself holds for parameter values within the interval [0.2533, 3.9].</description>

      <title>Stability of solitary waves for generalized $abcd$-Boussinesq system: The Hamiltonian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $abcd$-Boussinesq system is a model of two equations that can describe the propagation of small-amplitude long waves in both directions in the water of finite depth. Considering the Hamiltonian regimes, where the parameters $b$ and $d$ in the system satisfy $b=d&gt;0$, small solutions in the energy space are globally defined. Then, a variational approach is applied to establish the existence and nonlinear stability of the set of solitary-wave solutions for the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system. The main point of the analysis is to show that the traveling-wave solutions of the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system converge to nontrivial solitary-wave solutions of the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation. Moreover, if $p$ is the exponent of the nonlinear terms for the generalized $abcb$-Boussinesq system, then the nonlinear stability of the set of solitary-waves is obtained for any $p$ with $ 0 &lt; p &lt; p_0$ where $p_0 $ is strictly larger than $4$, while it has been known that the critical exponent for the stability of solitary waves of the generalized KdV equations is equal to $ 4$.</description>

      <title>Struwe's Global Compactness and energy approximation of the critical Sobolev embedding in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some of the effects of the lack of compactness in the critical Folland-Stein-Sobolev embedding in very general (possible non-smooth) domains, by proving via De Giorgi's $\Gamma$-convergence techniques that optimal functions for a natural subcritical approximations of the Sobolev quotient concentrate energy at one point. In the second part of the paper, we try to restore the compactness by extending the celebrated Global Compactness result to the Heisenberg group via a completely different approach with respect to the original one by Struwe [37].</description>

      <title>The limit theory of the energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limit behavior of the solutions to energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We give a rigorous theory of the zero-dispersion limit from energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation to energy-critical nonlinear heat equation for dimensions 3 and 4 in both the defocusing and focusing cases by energy method. Furthermore, we also show the invisicid limit of energy-critical complex Ginzburg-Landau equation to energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for dimension 4 in the focusing case.</description>

      <title>Change of regularity in controllability and observability of systems of wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions of a system of wave equations are constructed for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at every regularity level. We prove that boundary observability, and thus boundary exact controllability, at some regularity level is equivalent to boundary observability at all levels. The main ingredient is the ellipticity of a time-derivative on the Neumann trace of the solution, which is proved by microlocal techniques.</description>

      <title>Global Sobolev regularity for nonvariational operators built with homogeneous H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonvariational degenerate elliptic operators of the kind \[ Lu=\sum_{i,j=1}^{m}a_{ij}\left( x\right) X_{i}X_{j}u \] where $\left\{ a_{ij}\left( x\right) \right\} _{i,j=1}^{m}$ is a symmetric uniformly positive matrix of bounded measurable functions defined in the whole $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n&gt;m$), possibly discontinuos but satisfying a $VMO$ assumption, and $X_{1},...,X_{m}$ are real smooth vector fields satisfying H\"{o}rmander rank condition in the whole $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $1$-homogeneous w.r.t. a family of nonisotropic dilations. We do not assume that the vector fields are left invariant w.r.t. an underlying Lie group of translations. We prove global $W_{X}^{2,p}$ a-priori estimates, for every $p\in\left( 1,\infty\right) $, of the kind: \[ \Vert u\Vert_{W_{X}^{2,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}\leq c\left\{ \left\Vert Lu\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) }+\left\Vert u\right\Vert _{L^{p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) }\right\} \] for every $u\in W_{X}^{2,p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) .$ We also prove higher order estimates and corresponding regularity results: if $a_{ij}\in W_{X}^{k,\infty}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) $, $u\in W_{X}^{2,p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) $, $Lu\in W_{X}^{k,p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) $, then $u\in W_{X}^{k+2,p}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) $ and \[ \Vert u\Vert_{W_{X}^{k+2,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}\leq c\left\{ \Vert Lu\Vert_{W_{X}^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}+\Vert u\Vert_{L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n} )}\right\} . \]</description>

      <title>Deep learning surrogate for predicting hydraulic conductivity tensors from stochastic discrete fracture-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating 2D flow in fractured crystalline rock requires 2D stochastic discrete-fracture matrix (DFM) models. To obtain the simulation statistics of interest at an affordable computational cost, we aim to use the multilevel Monte Carlo method. To use this multiscale approach, one needs to upscale the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures by numerical homogenization. In this work, we substitute numerical homogenization with a surrogate model to speed up the computations. In particular, we resort to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a deep feed-forward neural network. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor $K_{eq}$ is predicted based on an input spatial random field (SRF) of hydraulic conductivity tensors, cross-section, and hydraulic conductivity of fractures. Three independent surrogates with the same architecture are trained using data from DFM models with three different ratios of hydraulic conductivities of fracture and bulk $K_f/K_b$. As the $K_f/K_b$ ratio increases, the multivariate $K_{eq}$ distribution becomes more complex, and thus, the prediction accuracy of the trained surrogates deteriorates. Regardless of $K_f/K_b$, however, an improvement in the prediction accuracy of the trained surrogates is noted as the considered fracture density of the modeling setup decreases. We also investigate prediction accuracy on input SRFs of different correlation lengths. Upscaling by numerical homogenization and by surrogate modeling is compared on two practical problems: upscaling of the hydraulic conductivity tensor and groundwater flow through a given surface. We obtained equally accurate results for the equivalent hydraulic tensor calculation of upscaled DFM models regardless of the upscaling method. For the groundwater flow problem, the accuracy of quantity of interest imitates the accuracy of $K_{eq}$ predictions.</description>

      <title>Normalized grounded states for a coupled nonlinear schr\"{o}dinger system on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of normalized ground states to the system of coupled Schr\"odinger equations: \begin{equation}\label{eq:0.1}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 + \lambda_1 u_1 = \mu_1 |u_1|^{p_1-2}u_1 + \beta r_1|u_1|^{r_1-2}u_1|u_2|^{r_2} &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{3},
  -\Delta u_2 + \lambda_2 u_2 = \mu_2|u_2|^{p_2-2}u_2 + \beta r_2|u_1|^{r_1}|u_2|^{r_2-2}u_2 &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} subject to the constraints $\mathcal{S}_{a_1} \times \mathcal{S}_{a_2} = \{(u_1 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_1^2 dx = a_1^2\} \times \{(u_2 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_2^2 dx = a_2^2\}$, where $\mu_1, \mu_2 &gt; 0$, $r_1, r_2 &gt; 1$, and $\beta \geq 0$. Our focus is on the coupled mass super-critical case, specifically, $$\frac{10}{3} &lt; p_1, p_2, r_1 + r_2 &lt; 2^* = 6.$$ We demonstrate that there exists a $\tilde{\beta} \geq 0$ such that equation (\ref{eq:0.1}) admits positive, radially symmetric, normalized ground state solutions when $\beta &gt; \tilde{\beta}$. Furthermore, this result can be generalized to systems with an arbitrary number of components, and the corresponding standing wave is orbitally unstable.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spectral Problems for Collapsing Manifolds I: Uniqueness and Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:1209.5875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the geometric inverse problem of determining a closed Riemannian manifold from measurements of the heat kernel in an open subset of the manifold. In this paper we analyze the stability of this problem in the class of $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature. It is well-known that a sequence in this class of manifolds can collapse to a lower dimensional stratified space when the injectivity radius of the sequence of manifolds goes to zero. We prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem on the limiting spaces of the collapsing manifolds. As a result, we obtain stability results for the inverse problem in the class of manifolds with bounded diameter and sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Estimating and using information in inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, one attempts to infer spatially variable functions from indirect measurements of a system. To practitioners of inverse problems, the concept of "information" is familiar when discussing key questions such as which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and detectors, because we have "the most information" for these places. Although referenced in many publications, the "information" that is invoked in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity.
  Herein, we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem. We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in $H^{\alpha}$ and structure-preserving algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate the global existence of a solution for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with radially symmetric initial data in a suitable energy space $H^{\alpha}$. We then show that the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the Stratonovich sense forms an infinite-dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system, with its phase flow preserving symplecticity. Finally, we develop a stochastic midpoint scheme for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation from the perspective of symplectic geometry. It is proved that the stochastic midpoint scheme satisfies the corresponding symplectic law in the discrete sense. A numerical example is conducted to validate the efficiency of the theory.</description>
