      <title>Exploiting Distributional Value Functions for Financial Market Valuation, Enhanced Feature Creation and Improvement of Trading Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While research of reinforcement learning applied to financial markets predominantly concentrates on finding optimal behaviours, it is worth to realize that the reinforcement learning returns $G_t$ and state value functions themselves are of interest and play a pivotal role in the evaluation of assets. Instead of focussing on the more complex task of finding optimal decision rules, this paper studies and applies the power of distributional state value functions in the context of financial market valuation and machine learning based trading algorithms. Accurate and trustworthy estimates of the distributions of $G_t$ provide a competitive edge leading to better informed decisions and more optimal behaviour. Herein, ideas from predictive knowledge and deep reinforcement learning are combined to introduce a novel family of models called CDG-Model, resulting in a highly flexible framework and intuitive approach with minimal assumptions regarding underlying distributions. The models allow seamless integration of typical financial modelling pitfalls like transaction costs, slippage and other possible costs or benefits into the model calculation. They can be applied to any kind of trading strategy or asset class. The frameworks introduced provide concrete business value through their potential in market valuation of single assets and portfolios, in the comparison of strategies as well as in the improvement of market timing. They can positively impact the performance and enhance the learning process of existing or new trading algorithms. They are of interest from a scientific point-of-view and open up multiple areas of future research. Initial implementations and tests were performed on real market data. While the results are promising, applying a robust statistical framework to evaluate the models in general remains a challenge and further investigations are needed.</description>

      <title>Review of deep learning models for crypto price prediction: implementation and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been much interest in accurate cryptocurrency price forecast models by investors and researchers. Deep Learning models are prominent machine learning techniques that have transformed various fields and have shown potential for finance and economics. Although various deep learning models have been explored for cryptocurrency price forecasting, it is not clear which models are suitable due to high market volatility. In this study, we review the literature about deep learning for cryptocurrency price forecasting and evaluate novel deep learning models for cryptocurrency stock price prediction. Our deep learning models include variants of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the Transformer model. We evaluate univariate and multivariate approaches for multi-step ahead predicting of cryptocurrencies close-price. Our results show that the univariate LSTM model variants perform best for cryptocurrency predictions. We also carry out volatility analysis on the four cryptocurrencies which reveals significant fluctuations in their prices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we investigate the prediction accuracy of two scenarios identified by different training sets for the models. First, we use the pre-COVID-19 datasets to model cryptocurrency close-price forecasting during the early period of COVID-19. Secondly, we utilise data from the COVID-19 period to predict prices for 2023 to 2024.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Test for Volatility in Clustered Multiple Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contagion arising from clustering of multiple time series like those in the stock market indicators can further complicate the nature of volatility, rendering a parametric test (relying on asymptotic distribution) to suffer from issues on size and power. We propose a test on volatility based on the bootstrap method for multiple time series, intended to account for possible presence of contagion effect. While the test is fairly robust to distributional assumptions, it depends on the nature of volatility. The test is correctly sized even in cases where the time series are almost nonstationary. The test is also powerful specially when the time series are stationary in mean and that volatility are contained only in fewer clusters. We illustrate the method in global stock prices data.</description>
