      <title>$\beta$-Uniform Convexity and Divisible Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divisible convex sets have long been important in the study of Hilbert geometries. When a divisible convex set is an ellipsoid, the Hilbert geometry it induces is the hyperbolic space. In general, strictly convex divisible domains exhibit negative curvature properties, but only the ellipsoid is a CAT(0) space. The notion of p-uniform convexity from the theory of Banach spaces has been proposed as a generalization of the Alexandrov-Toponogov comparison theorems to Finsler manifolds. We prove that a natural Finsler metric on a strictly convex divisible domain is $\beta$-uniformly convex, where the exact constant $\beta$ is related to the regularity of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Thick embeddings into the Heisenberg group and coarse wirings into groups with polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the volume of thick embeddings of finite graphs into the Heisenberg group, as well as the volume of coarse wirings of finite graphs into groups with polynomial growth. This work follows the work of Kolmogorov-Brazdin, Gromov-Guth and Barret-Hume on thick embeddings of graphs (or complexes) into various spaces. We present here a conjecture of Itai Benjamini that suggest that the lower bound of the volume of thick embeddings of finite graphs into locally finite, non-planar, transitive graphs, obtained by the separation profile, is tight. Let $Y$ be a Cayley graph of a group with polynomial growth, we prove that any finite bounded-degree graph $G$ admits a coarse $C\log(1+|G|)$-wiring into $Y$ with the optimal volume suggested by the conjecture. Additionally, for the concrete case where $Y$ is a Cayley graph of the 3 dimensional discrete Heisenberg group, we prove that any finite bounded-degree graph $G$ admits a $1$-thick embedding into $Y$, with optimal volume up to factor $\log^2(1+|G|)$.</description>

      <title>Typical Lipschitz images of rectifiable metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies typical 1-Lipschitz images of $n$-rectifiable metric spaces $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m\geq n$. For example, if $E\subset \mathbb{R}^k$, we show that the Jacobian of such a typical 1-Lipschitz map equals 1 $\mathcal{H}^n$-almost everywhere and, if $m&gt;n$, preserves the Hausdorff measure of $E$. In general, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the tangent norms of $E$, for when a typical 1-Lipschitz map preserves the Hausdorff measure of $E$, up to some constant multiple. Almost optimal results for strongly $n$-rectifiable metric spaces are obtained.
  On the other hand, for any norm $|\cdot|$ on $\mathbb{R}^m$, we show that, in the space of 1-Lipschitz functions from $([-1,1]^n,|\cdot|_\infty)$ to $(\mathbb{R}^m,|\cdot|)$, the $\mathcal{H}^n$-measure of a typical image is not bounded below by any $\Delta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <title>The Klain approach to zonal valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show an analogue of the Klain-Schneider theorem for valuations that are invariant under rotations around a fixed axis, called zonal. Using this, we establish a new integral representation of zonal valuations involving mixed area measures with a disk. In our argument, we introduce an easy way to translate between this representation and the one involving area measures, yielding a shorter proof of a recent characterization by Knoerr. As applications, we obtain various zonal integral geometric formulas, extending results by Hug, Mussnig, and Ulivelli. Finally, we provide a simpler proof of the integral representation of the mean section operators by Goodey and Weil.</description>

      <title>Empty simplices of large width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.14925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An empty simplex is a lattice simplex in which vertices are the only lattice points. We show two constructions leading to the first known empty simplices of width larger than their dimension:
  - We introduce cyclotomic simplices and exhaustively compute all the cyclotomic simplices of dimension $10$ and volume up to $2^{31}$. Among them we find five empty ones of width $11$, and none of larger width.
  - Using circulant matrices of a very specific form, we construct empty simplices of arbitrary dimension $d$ and width growing asymptotically as $d/\operatorname{arcsinh}(1) \sim 1.1346\,d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve a conjecture of F\"assler and Orponen on the dimension of exceptional projections to one-dimensional subspaces indexed by a space curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We do this by obtaining sharp $L^p$ bounds for a variant of the Wolff circular maximal function over fractal sets for a class of $C^2$ curves related to Sogge's cinematic curvature condition. A key new tool is the use of lens cutting techniques from discrete geometry.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of 4-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>
