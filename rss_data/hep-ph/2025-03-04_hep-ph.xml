      <title>Possible origin of the KM3-230213A neutrino event from dark matter decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of the highest energy neutrino event with 220 PeV energy, detected recently by the KM3NeT experiment to be originating from heavy dark matter (DM) decay. Considering a heavy right handed neutrino (RHN) DM for illustrative purpose, we show that DM mass of 440 PeV, can explain the observed flux. The required DM lifetime to produce the best-fit value of the neutrino flux saturates the existing gamma-ray bounds. Due to the large uncertainty in the flux, it is possible to explain the KM3NeT event from RHN DM decay at $3\sigma$ confidence level (CL) while being in agreement with gamma-ray bounds and non-observation of similar events at IceCube. While we consider a gauged $B-L$ scenario where DM relic can be generated due to other interactions, we also briefly discuss some alternate DM possibilities where the gamma-ray bounds can be alleviated compared to the minimal RHN DM discussed here.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Loop-Induced Decays of Leptophilic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptophilic sub-MeV spin-zero dark matter (DM) decays into photons via one-loop processes, a scenario that has been in part overlooked in current literature. In this work, we provide updated and comprehensive upper limits on scalar, pseudo-scalar, and axion-like DM-electron couplings based on the latest NPIPE cosmic microwave background data from Planck. Our bounds on the couplings are not only competitive with astrophysical and terrestrial experiments, but outperform them in certain regions of parameter space. Notably, we present the most stringent limits to date on scalar DM with masses around a few keV and pseudo-scalar DM with masses between 100 eV and a few keV. Additionally, we explore, for the first time, the impact of implementing a cosmology-consistent treatment of energy deposition into the cosmic medium.</description>

      <title>Novel $|V_{cb}|$ extraction method via boosted $bc$-tagging with in-situ calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring $|V_{cb}|$ at the LHC using an advanced boosted-jet tagger to identify "$bc$ signatures". By associating boosted $W \rightarrow bc$ signals with $bc$-matched jets from top-quark decays, we enable an in-situ calibration of the tagger. This approach significantly suppressed backgrounds while reducing uncertainties in flavor tagging efficiencies, a key factor in measurement precision. Using simulated datasets equipped with advanced and consistent large and small radius jet tagging models (the so-called Sophon and the newly developed SophonAK4, which are validated to perform comparably to taggers in ATLAS and CMS), we show that the new method complements the conventional small radius jet approach and outperforms it under the HL-LHC projection. Our work offers a new perspective for the precision $|V_{cb}|$ measurement and highlights the potential of using advanced tagging models to probe unexplored boosted regimes at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Probing Superheavy Dark Matter with Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets, with their large volumes and low temperatures, are ideal celestial detectors for probing dark matter (DM) interactions. DM particles can lose energy through scattering with the planetary interior and become gravitationally captured if their interaction with the visible sector is sufficiently strong. In the absence of annihilation, the captured DM thermalizes and accumulates at the planet's center, eventually collapsing into black holes (BH). Using gaseous exoplanets as an example, we demonstrate that BH formation can occur within an observable timescale for superheavy DM with masses greater than $10^6 \, \mathrm{ GeV}$ and nuclear scattering cross sections. The BHs may either accrete the planetary medium or evaporate via Hawking radiation, depending on the mass of the DM that formed them. We explore the possibility of periodic BH formation within the unconstrained DM parameter space and discuss potential detection methods, including observations of planetary-mass objects, pulsed high-energy cosmic rays, and variations in exoplanet temperatures. Our findings suggest that future extensive exoplanet observations could provide complementary opportunities to terrestrial and cosmological searches for superheavy DM.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Scaling in Pair Production for Scalar QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the dynamical scaling of momentum spectra for particle-antiparticle pairs at finite times within the framework of scalar Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The analysis focuses on the momentum spectra in two different choices of adiabatic mode functions, which are related by a Wronskian normalization condition. Oscillations in the momentum spectra are attributed to quantum interference effects in the adiabatic number basis. A novel dynamical scaling behavior emerges when examining the oscillatory momentum spectra of pairs created by a Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times. While the oscillatory spectra are observed at distinct times in the two different choices, they overlap when time is rescaled by the point marking the initiation of the first occurrence of the Residual ParticleAntiparticle Plasma (RPAP) stage (or end of the transient stage) for the central momentum case. This scaling identifies the approximate time at which real particle-antiparticle pair formation becomes possible, shifting the focus from asymptotic times to finite-time dynamics. Additionally, in the multi-photon regime, we find that the momentum spectra exhibit a multi-modal profile structure at finite times, consistent across both choices and also follow the dynamical scaling in this case as well.</description>

      <title>One-loop off-shell quark-gluon vertex in arbitrary gauge and dimensions: a streamlined approach through the second-order formalism of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Feynman rules used for perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are derived from a Lagrangian that is first-order in derivatives. It includes a three-point quark-gluon vertex which obscures the precise disentangled manner in which spin and momentum are interchanged during these interactions. An unambiguous understanding of this interchange is insightful for efficiently extracting physically relevant information from various Green's functions. To separate the scalar and spin degrees of freedom and gain physical insight from the outset, we examine the quark-gluon vertex using the less commonly employed second-order formalism of QCD. We compute this off-shell vertex in arbitrary space-time dimensions and covariant gauges by using scalar integrals with shifted dimensions, which include higher powers of the propagators, within a combined first- and second-order formalism. This approach naturally identifies the transverse components of the quark-gluon vertex, even before evaluating the tensor Feynman integrals. We also compute the on-shell version of this vertex using exclusively the second-order formalism, facilitating a precise identification of spin and momentum interchange. Through analyzing the Pauli form factor at $k^2=0$ (where $k$ represents the momentum of the external gluon), we find that only a specific set of second-order Feynman diagrams are relevant for calculating the electromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole moments. These diagrams represent quantum processes in which the spin of the incoming quark changes only once due to interactions with the virtual gluons that form the quark-gluon vertex. All other interactions involve only momentum interchange (scalar interactions). Our results are in complete agreement with those obtained from the first-order formalism.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Electroweak Phase Transitions: Thermal History and Dynamics from Bubble Nucleation to Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is crucial for cosmology and particle physics, with a profound impact on electroweak baryogenesis, symmetry breaking, and gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, many studies overlook key aspects of EWPT dynamics, leading to misidentified patterns and overestimated GW signals. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive framework for analyzing EWPTs, focusing on the vacuum's thermal history and dynamics from bubble nucleation to percolation. Using the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real scalar singlet model, we demonstrate the occurrence of spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking in the high-temperature vacuum, leading to diverse EWPT processes, including multi-step transitions and inverse symmetry breaking. We identify four distinct EWPT patterns, each characterized by unique symmetry-breaking mechanisms and associated with bubbles exhibiting distinct field configurations, which can be analyzed using a formalism based on energy density distributions developed here. A key finding is that bubble nucleation fails in extremely strong phase transitions (PTs) with low nucleation rates, or in ultra-fast PTs involving inverse $s$-bubbles that collapse instantly upon formation, both of which lead to false vacuum trapping and the absence of observable GW signals. In first-order PTs where nucleation succeeds, stronger transitions occur later in the universe's evolution, while weaker transitions proceed more rapidly. Multi-step transitions involving (inverse) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking give rise to complex transition sequences and exotic bubble dynamics, such as sequential nucleation or the coexistence of bubbles from different vacua -- phenomena with significant implications for GW spectra, dark matter, and baryogenesis. This work advances our understanding of EWPT dynamics and lays the groundwork for future studies of EWPTs in BSM physics.</description>

      <title>The $B^-\to J/\psi\eta^\prime K^-$ reaction and the $Y(4710)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent LHCb Collaboration analysis, we have investigated the process $B^-\to J/\psi\eta^\prime K^-$ by considering the contributions from the resonances $Y(4710)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$, where the $K_0^*(1430)$ is regarded as a dynamically generated state from the vector meson-vector meson interaction. Our results are in good agreement with the measured invariant mass distributions and the Dalitz plot of LHCb, which supports the molecular explanation of the $K_0^*(1430)$, and that the $Y(4710)$ can be produced in the process $B^-\to J/\psi\eta^\prime K^-$. Since the decay mode of $Y(4710)\to J/\psi \eta'$ is Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) suppressed for the charmonium state, the measurements of the $\mathcal{B}(Y(4710)\to J/\psi\eta')$ through the process $B^-\to J/\psi \eta' K^-$ or other processes is crucial to understanding the nature of the $Y(4710)$. Thus, we advocate that Belle~II and LHCb Collaborations could perform the more precise analysis to confirm the evidence of the $Y(4710)$ state, which could be helpful to reduce the experimental uncertainties of its mass and width, and to explore its nature.</description>

      <title>Does $f_1(1420)$ have a double-peak structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-pion exchange interaction between the kaon and the vector antikaon is investigated by solving the Schrodinger equation in the S-wave approximation. In addition to the $f_1(1285)$ particle, another bound state of $K \bar{K}^*$ is found, which is approximately 9 MeV below the threshold of $K \bar{K}^*$ and labeled $f_1(1378)$ for convenience in this manuscript. Under the outgoing wave condition, two resonance states of $K \bar{K}^*$ are produced by solving the Schrodinger equation with different coupling constants in the one-pion-exchange potential fixed with the binding energies of $K \bar{K}^*$ bound states $f_1(1285)$ and $f_1(1378)$ respectively. Both of the resonance states are located in the vicinity of 1400 MeV, and thus it is reasonable to assume that these two resonance states correspond to the $f_1(1420)$ particle in the review of the Particle Data Group although they arise from different couplings of the kaon and vector antikaon, respectively.</description>

      <title>Study of $1^{--}$ P wave charmoniumlike and bottomoniumlike tetraquark spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of $1^{--}$ P-wave charmonium-like and bottomonium-like tetraquark states are calculated in a constituent quark model (CQM) where the Cornell-like potential and Breit-Fermi interaction are employed. All model parameters were imported from previous work, and predetermined by studying the low-lying conventional S- and P-wave light, charmed, bottom, charmonium, and bottomonium meson mass spectra. The decay widths of $1^{--}$ P-wave tetraquark states are calculated for possible two-body strong decay channels within the rearrangement mechanism, including $\omega \chi_{cJ}$, $\eta J/\psi$, and $\rho J/\psi$ for charmonium-like tetraquarks, and $\omega \chi_{bJ}$ for bottomonium-like tetraquarks. The tetraquark theoretical results are compared with the selected exotic states, also known as Y states, and tentative assignments are suggested. This study suggests that $\psi(4230)$, $\psi(4360)$, $\psi(4660)$, and $\Upsilon$(10753) may be P-wave tetraquark states and that multiple states might exist around 4.23 GeV and 4.36 GeV.</description>

      <title>Possible Explanation of $F_2^n/F_2^p$ at Large $x$ Using Quantum Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratio of the neutron to proton structure functions, $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$, is expected to approach 1/4 as $x \to 1$, based on the assumption that $d (x) / u (x)$ vanishes as $x \to 1$. This expectation is in striking disagreement with a recent measurement by the Marathon experiment of the scattering of electrons off the mirror nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He, showing that $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$ is larger than 1/4 for $ x \rightarrow 1$. We have examined the consequences of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for the parton distributions in the nucleon when the partons are described by quantum statistical mechanics. We find that the recent experimental result on the $F^n_2(x)/F^p_2(x)$ over the broad range of $x$ can be well described by the quantum statistical approach.</description>

      <title>The $J/\psi$-nucleon interaction mechanism: A theoretical study based on scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is of significant importance for various reasons. It is deeply interconnected with the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is pertinent to the properties of $J/\psi$ in nuclear medium. The scattering can occur through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism involving open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states $\Lambda_c \bar D^{(*)}$ and $ \Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. In this study, we investigate the $S$-wave $J/\psi N$ scattering length arising from both mechanisms. Our findings indicate that both mechanisms lead to attractive interactions, yielding scattering lengths of $[-10, -0.1] \times 10^{-3}$ fm for the coupled-channel mechanism and $&lt;-0.16$ fm for the soft-gluon exchange mechanism, respectively. Notably, the soft-gluon exchange mechanism produces a scattering length that is at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism, indicating its predominance. These findings can be corroborated through lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of scattering processes that violate the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>Matching the real Higgs triplet extension of Standard Model to HEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a first matching of the real Higgs triplet extension (RHTE) of the standard model to the Higgs effective field theory (HEFT), which is also known as electroweak chiral Lagrangian (EWChL). In the RHTE, the ratio $\xi$ of two VEVs separately from triplet and doublet is a tiny quantity, due to the constrained custodial symmetry violation. Based on the nonlinear representation~\cite{Song:2024kos} of RHTE and functional method, we get the HEFT in the power counting of $\xi$. By comparing its phenomenological results of $hh\to hh$, $W W \to h h$, $Z Z \to hh $ to SMEFT's, we show its convergence property is as good as SMEFT's. Besides we explicitly show that the HEFT is available in the phase transition region where SMEFT fails.</description>

Abstract: We study radiation by a fast particle in a medium with a finite chiral chemical potential. The medium's anomalous response encompasses the chiral magnetic effect, enabling novel chiral Cherenkov and pair production processes. The kinematics of the corresponding cascades is fundamentally different from conventional cascades. Notably, it is not dominated by the strong ordering of momenta. Employing the effective Chern-Simons extensions of QED and QCD to incorporate the chiral magnetic effect, we derive and solve the evolution equations describing the cascades in a chiral medium, presuming that the anomalous contributions are dominant.</description>

      <title>Exploring fully-heavy tetraquarks through the CGAN framework: Mass and width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-heavy tetraquark states, $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{Q} (Q=c,b)$, have garnered significant attention both experimentally and theoretically, due to their unique properties and potential to provide new insights into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this study, we employ Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to predict the masses and decay widths of fully-heavy tetraquarks. To deepen our understanding of heavy multiquark structures, we prepare datasets based on two distinct approaches and train the CGAN model using both. The CGAN framework allows us to capture the complex relationships between input features, such as quark content, quantum numbers, and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and output properties, including mass and decay width. Our predictions, based on the CGAN framework, are consistent with existing data. By combining fundamental knowledge of QCD with advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of fully-heavy tetraquark states. Our CGAN approach has the potential to become a strong contender for future studies in heavy tetraquark systems, complementing existing theoretical models to deliver more precise results. Additionally, our findings could assist in the search for fully-heavy tetraquark systems in future experiments.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>General behavior of near-threshold hadron scattering for exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the general behavior of the near-threshold scattering amplitude with channel couplings. The signal of the exotic hadrons near the threshold may manifest as a dip structure in the cross section originated from a zero point of the scattering amplitude. Such a dip structure by the zero point cannot be reproduced by the Flatt\'{e} amplitude which is widely used for the analysis of exotic hadrons, because of the constraints imposed on the Flatt\'{e} amplitude near the threshold. In this work, we propose the General amplitude which can describe the dip structure near the threshold, in contrast to the Flatt\'{e} amplitude. Moreover, we numerically study the behavior of the near-threshold cross section in relation to the zero point.</description>

      <title>Effects of Initial Nucleon-Nucleon Correlations on Light Nuclei Production in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3\ $ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions serves as a sensitive probe of the QCD phase structure. In coalescence models, triton ($N_t$) and deuteron ($N_d$) yields depend on the spatial separation of nucleon pairs ($\Delta r$) in Wigner functions, yet the impact of initial two-nucleon correlations $\rho(\Delta r)$ remains underexplored. We develop a method to sample nucleons in $^{197}$Au nuclei that simultaneously satisfies both the single-particle distribution $f(r)$ and the two-nucleon correlation $\rho(\Delta r)$. Using these nuclei, we simulate Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=3$ GeV via the SMASH transport model (mean-field mode) to calculate proton, deuteron, and triton yields. Simulations reveal a 36% enhancement in mid-rapidity deuteron yields across all centrality ranges and a 33% rise in mid-rapidity triton production for 0-10% central collisions. Calculated transverse momentum of light nuclei aligns with STAR data. We further analyze impacts of baryon conservation, spectator exclusion, and centrality determination via charged multiplicity. Notably, observed discrepancies in the double yield ratio suggest unaccounted physical mechanisms, such as critical fluctuations or inaccuracies in coalescence parameters or light nuclei cross-sections. This underscores the critical role of initial nucleon-nucleon correlations, linking microscopic nuclear structure to intermediate-energy collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reheating after Axion Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reheating process in an axion inflation model where the inflaton couples to non-Abelian gauge fields via the Chern-Simons coupling. The Chern-Simons coupling leads to the efficient production of gauge fields via a tachyonic instability during inflation, whose implications have been actively studied in the literatures. Moreover, it has been recently pointed out that the produced gauge fields can be even thermalized during inflation, leading to warm inflation. Apparently, these findings seem to imply that the reheating is completed immediately after inflation because the tachyonic instability or the thermal friction induced by the Chern-Simons coupling cause the inflaton condensate to decay rapidly. Contrary to this naive expectation, however, we show that, in most of the parameter space, either the inflaton condensate, the inflaton particles, or the glueballs once dominate the Universe and their perturbative decay completes the reheating.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of singly heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with heavy-quark dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous calculation of the spin-orbit terms in the three-quark system is preliminarily realized based on the Gaussian expansion method and the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions in the frame work of the relativized quark model, by ignoring the mixing between different excited states. Then, the complete mass spectra of the singly heavy baryons are obtained rigorously, under the mechanism of the heavy-quark dominance. On these bases, the systematical analyses are carried out for the reliability and predictive power of the model, the fine structure of the singly heavy baryon spectra, the assignments of the excited baryons, and some important topics about the heavy baryon spectroscopy such as the missing states, the `spin-orbit puzzle', the clustering effect, etc. The result confirms that under the heavy-quark dominance mechanism, the relativized quark model can describe the excitation spectra and the fine structures of the singly heavy baryons correctly and precisely.</description>

      <title>Role of the Short-Range Dynamics in the Formation of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}/B^{(*)}\bar B^{(*)} $ Hadronic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate potential hadronic molecular states in the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems using light meson exchange interactions. Our analysis focuses on coupled-channel systems with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+\pm}$ and $2^{++}$, examining how the $\delta(r)$ potential affects states near threshold. Using coupled-channel analysis, we reproduce the $X(3872)$ mass with a given cutoff for the $(I)J^{PC}=(0)1^{++}$ state, finding a minimal impact from the $\delta(r)$ term. At this cutoff, both the $(0)0^{++}$ state near the $D\bar D$ threshold and the $(0)1^{+-}$ state near the $D\bar D^*$ threshold show less sensitivity to the $\delta(r)$ term compared to the three states-$(0)0^{++}$, $(0)1^{+-}$, and $(0)2^{++}$-near the $D^*\bar D^*$ threshold. As anticipated, the $B^{(*)}\bar B^{*}$ systems exhibit similar behavior but with stronger binding due to their larger reduced mass. These findings suggest promising directions for future experimental searches, particularly in the isoscalar sector, which could substantially advance our understanding of exotic tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Formation of true muonium in the Drell-Yan dimuon production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new mechanism for the formation of true muonium ($T\!M$), the QED $(\mu^+ \mu^-)$ bound state, due to the Coulomb interaction of muons from $\mu^+ \mu^-$ pairs generated in the Drell-Yan reaction of protons off nuclei of a thin foil target. The $T\!M$ atoms produced in the $^3S_1$ long-lived triplet state ($oT\!M$) could escape from the foil to vacuum followed by their decay into $e^+e^-$ pairs. Observation of $e^+e^-$ events with a displaced vertex, and an invariant mass and decay time consistent with the mass and lifetime of the $oT\!M$ is used as a signature of the discovery of $T\!M$. We present estimates of the $T\!M$ yield and briefly discuss an experiment which could lead to such a discovery.</description>

      <title>Global Neutrino Constraints on the Minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge model in light of the latest neutrino data, including neutrino oscillations, cosmological observations, direct mass measurements, and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Using the most conservative oscillation data, we find that normal ordering is excluded at approximately the 90% confidence level (CL). Incorporating cosmological constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations strengthens this exclusion to about 95% CL, while further including Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data increases it to nearly 99% CL. The inverted ordering is even more strongly disfavored. Our analysis is performed within a frequentist framework, minimizing sensitivity to prior assumptions inherent in Bayesian approaches. These results impose strong constraints on the viability of the minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Decay Mechanisms of $1^{-+}$ Hybrid States in Light Meson Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of exotic mesons, which transcend the conventional quark-antiquark framework, is pivotal for advancing our understanding of QCD and the strong interaction. Among these, states possessing the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, such as $\pi_1(1600)$, $\pi_1(2015)$, and the recently discovered $\eta_1(1855)$, have attracted significant attention due to their potential hybrid nature, which involves gluonic excitations. However, the physical interpretation of these states remains contentious, primarily due to inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations regarding their decay widths and mass spectra. To address these challenges, we employ a potential model inspired by SU$(3)$ lattice gauge theory to calculate the masses of light-flavor $1^{-+}$ hybrid states and utilize the constituent gluon model to analyze their strong decay properties. Our mass calculations suggest that while the $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\eta_1(1855)$ masses are in close agreement with the predicted hybrid states, the corresponding decay widths for $\pi_1(1600)$ and $\pi_1(2015)$ do not support their classification as hybrids, implying alternative interpretations, such as tetraquark or molecular configurations. Conversely, the $\eta_1(1855)$ is consistent with a mixed hybrid state composed of $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})g/\sqrt{2}$ and $s\bar{s}g$ components, with mixing angles ranging from $21^\circ$ to $74^\circ$. Additionally, we predict the masses and decay widths of yet-unobserved isoscalar and excited hybrid states, providing valuable targets for future experimental searches. This study not only clarifies the hybrid nature of certain exotic mesons but also contributes to the systematic classification of hybrid states within the meson nonet, thereby enhancing our comprehension of exotic hadronic states.</description>

      <title>Reweighting and Analysing Event Generator Systematics by Neural Networks on High-Level Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models for jet classification use jet constituent information directly, improving performance tremendously. This draws attention to interpretability, namely, the decision-making process, correlations contributing to the classification, and high-level features (HLFs) representing the difference between signal and background. We address the interpretability issue using a modular architecture called the analysis model (AM), which combines several motivated HLFs as the input. We focus on the generator systematics of the top vs. QCD classification by one of the best classifiers, Particle Transformer (ParT). Taking commonly used event generators Pythia (PY) and Herwig (HW) as examples, we demonstrate that the event weights estimated by the AM generator classifier align the HW classification score distribution to PY ones for QCD jets, with small training uncertainty. This suggests the AM is sufficient to describe simulated QCD jet features with relatively few observables, and generator systematics would also be reduced by reweighting the simulation by data. On the other hand, large event weights are required for QCD-like top jets, which leads to imperfect reweighting for both AM and ParT generator classifiers. Moreover, the AM HLFs are insufficient for describing PY and HW differences, causing lower reweighting accuracy compared with ParT. The missing features are the correlation among the collimated high-energy jet constituents, which are strongly correlated to the energy flow polynomials (EFPs) selected for top vs. QCD classification, showing the complementarity between AM HLFs and the selected EFPs.</description>

      <title>Correlated study on some $B_{c}\rightarrow \text{ }P$ and $B_{c}\rightarrow\text{ }S$ wave channels in light of new inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the decay modes of the $B_c$ meson, focusing on semileptonic and nonleptonic decay into S and P wave charmonia. The primary objective is to extract the shape parameter of the $B_{c}$ meson distribution amplitude through a data-driven approach, utilizing the lattice results on $B_{c}\rightarrow\eta_{c},J/\psi$ semileptonic form factors and yielding an estimate of ${\omega_B}_c = 0.998(34)$ for the same. We use the form factors derived from the modified perturbative QCD framework in the analysis. This result and various other inputs on the radiative decays of the P wave charmonia enable us to estimate the $q^2$ shapes of the $B_{c}\rightarrow\chi_{c0},\chi_{c1}$ and $h_{c}$ form factors using pole expansion parametrization. Using these results, we have obtained predictions of LFUV observables $R(\chi_{c0})=0.169(11)$, $R(\chi_{c1})=0.126(2)$ and $R(h_{c})=0.113(3)$. Finally, we have presented predictions for branching ratios of some nonleptonic decay modes of the $B_{c}$ meson into S and P wave charmonia in the same modified perturbative QCD framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the statistical operator in the local-equilibrium approximation, we calculate the mean value of the energy-momentum tensor of a real scalar field. We show that the energy-momentum tensor has additional terms with respect to the one in a state of global thermodynamical equilibrium. Notably, the relation between the energy density and pressure, i.e., the effective equation of state, is modified with respect to the homogeneous equilibrium case. The obtained corrections are of non-equilibrium origin and might be relevant for systems created in relativistic hadron and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of intensity frontier experiments to search for unstable feebly interacting particles (FIPs) via signatures that offer deeper insights than the standard signature of a single FIP decay. Specifically, we study models where FIPs are produced in pairs in a single event, so both can simultaneously decay in the detector. These ``di-decay'' events allow us to identify the mother particle decaying into the FIP pair and reconstruct its properties, provide further insights into the dark sector couplings to the SM, and are much cleaner against backgrounds. As a concrete example, we focus on the class of models where the FIPs couple quadratically to the Higgs boson and derive the sensitivities of SHiP and Belle II to di-decays of Higgs-like scalars. In particular, at Belle II, finite backgrounds for the single decay signature make di-decays competitive, providing a distinctive handle on FIP production and lifetime.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the Quantum Ratio was born out of the efforts to find a simple but universal criterion if the center of mass (CM) of an isolated (microscopic or macroscopic) body behaves quantum mechanically or classically, and under which conditions. It is defined as the ratio between the quantum fluctuation range, which is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, and the linear size of the body (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases where the ratio is smaller than unity or much larger than unity, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. An important notion following from the introduction of quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical. This is so even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence (mixed state) and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation is further elaborated, by analyzing some atomic or molecular processes. It may have far-reaching implications on the way quantum mechanics works, e.g., in biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review has explored the fundamental principles of thermal field theory in the context of a background magnetic field, highlighting its theoretical framework and some of its applications to the thermo-magnetic QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. Our discussion has been limited to equilibrium systems for clarity and conciseness. We analyzed bulk thermodynamic characteristics including the phase diagram as well as real-time observables, shedding light on the behaviour and dynamics of the thermo-magnetic QCD medium relevant to heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pre-train the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set, and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode (FCC-ee). We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics; including jet resolution and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large physics models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping accelerate the development cycle for new detectors, and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip under the influence of a gravitational plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently studied spin precession in various stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes and applied it to the case of neutrinos propagating in those spacetimes. In this paper, the study of spin precession is extended to the case of a spinning particle propagating within the spacetime of a time-dependent gravitational plane wave. First, the angular velocity of spin precession of a particle propagating in a geodesic along an arbitrary direction relative to the gravitational wave is derived. Our general result is then used to derive the helicity flip probability for neutrinos freely propagating along such an arbitrary direction within the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron pair production in bound-bound muon transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored a distinct mechanism for matter creation via electron-positron pair production during bound-bound transitions in the deexcitation of one-muon ions. For ions with nuclear charges $Z\geq24$, transitions from low-lying excited states to the 1s-muon state can lead to the production of electron-positron pairs. We show that the Breit interaction determines the transition probabilities for states with nonzero orbital momentum. Although the $2s$ state is metastable, pair production arises mainly from the decay of the $2p$ states. Thus, the Breit interaction governs electron-positron pair production in bound-bound muon transitions. This process offers a unique opportunity to explore quantum electrodynamics in strong fields, as well as a class of nonradiative transitions involving electron-positron pair production.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter from hard dense loop perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semi-classical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anti-correlation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>An 85-s X-ray quasi-periodicity after a stellar tidal disruption by a candidate intermediate-mass black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is still in dispute the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with a mass of ~10^3-10^5 solar masses (Msun), which are the missing link between stellar-mass black holes (5-50 Msun) and supermassive black holes (10^6-10^10 Msun). The bright flares from tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a new and direct way to probe IMBHs. 3XMM J215022.4-055108 is a unique off-nuclear X-ray transient which can be best explained as the TDE by an IMBH in a massive star cluster, though its mass is not well determined. Here, we report the discovery of a transient X-ray quasi-periodicity signal from 3XMM J215022.4-055108 with a period of ~85 seconds (at a significance of &gt;3.51sigma) and fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of ~10%. Furthermore, the signal is coherent with a quality factor ~16. The significance drops to &gt;3.13sigma if considering all light curves with sufficient quality for QPO search. Combining with the results from X-ray continuum fittings, the detection of QPO allows for joint constraints on the black hole mass and dimensionless spin in the range [9.9*10^3-1.6*10^4 Msun]$ and [0.26-0.36], respectively. This result supports the presence of an IMBH in an off-nuclear massive star cluster and may open up the possibility of studying IMBHs through X-ray timing of TDEs.</description>

      <title>ASKAP observations of the radio shell in the composite supernova remnant G310.6-1.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observations of the radio shell of the supernova remnant (SNR) G310.6-1.6 at 943 MHz from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) and the Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) surveys by using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We detect polarized emission from the central pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with rotation measures varying from -696 rad m$^{-2}$ to -601 rad m$^{-2}$. We measure the integrated flux density of the shell to be 36.4 +/- 2.2 mJy at 943 MHz and derive a spectral index of -0.4 +/- 0.1 for the PWN and -0.7 +/- 0.3 for the SNR shell. From the combined radio and X-ray observations, the object can be identified as a supernova explosion of about 2500 yr ago with energy of about 1.3 x 10$^{50}$ erg, suggesting an ejected mass of about 10 M_sun. The circular radio shell outside the circular hard X-ray shell is unique among Galactic SNRs. We discuss several possible scenarios, including blast wave, reverse shock, and pulsar-fed emission, but find that none of them can fully explain the observed characteristics of the shell. This poses a challenge for understanding the evolution of SNRs. The results of this paper demonstrate the potential of the ASKAP EMU and POSSUM surveys in discovering more objects of small angular size and low surface brightness.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos from dense environments are unique laboratories for astrophysics, particle physics and many-body physics. They tell us about the last stages of the gravitational core-collapse and the explosion of massive stars. These elusive particles are also tightly linked to heavy elements synthesis in gravitational core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, or play a pivotal role at the MeV epoch during the Universe expansion. We highlight theoretical and observational aspects of this interesting domain, in particular for the future measurement of neutrinos from the next core-collapse supernova, and of the diffuse supernova background, whose discovery might lie in the forthcoming future.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in nonlinear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where nonlinear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterisations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalised Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments.

      <description>arXiv:2503.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present estimates for the production cross sections of exotic states ($\Lambda_c, \Sigma_c, \Xi_c, D\, \mathrm{and}\, D_s$) from secondary $\overline B + B$ annihilations in p+A reactions from $E_\mathrm{lab}=10-30A$~GeV. We focus specifically on the newly planned hadron physics program of CBM at FAIR. These estimates for the production of exotic states are based on the achievable number of $\overline B + B$ annihilations and their invariant mass distributions calculated in the UrQMD transport model.</description>

      <title>Kelvin waves in nonequilibrium universal dynamics of relativistic scalar field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chromodynamics Resolution of the ATOMKI Anomaly in ${\rm {^4He}}$ Nuclear Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of anomalous angular correlations in electron-positron pairs produced from excited states of $^{4}$He, $^{8}$Be and $^{12}$C nuclei have been suggested as due to the creation and subsequent decay of a new light particle of mass $\sim$17 MeV. In this work, we investigate the possibility that the source of the observed signals is a set of new excitation channels created by the 12-quark hidden-color Fock state within the ${\rm {^4He}}$ nuclear wavefunction dubbed the ``hexadiquark.'' We calculate the invariant $e^+e^-$ mass spectrum for the electromagnetic transition from a new excitation of $^{4}$He, estimating its differential and total decay width. We find that we can fit the shape of the anomalous signal with the QCD Fock state at excitation energy $\rm E^{*} = 17.9 \pm 1$ MeV and a Gaussian form factor for the electromagnetic decay. We address the physical issues with the fit parameters using properties of the hexadiquark state, in particular the three weakly repulsive $\rm 6_C$ interactions of $\rm SU(3)_C$ between diquark pairs. Experimental tests of our model are described in detail. In light of this work, we emphasize the need for independent experimental confirmation or refutation of the ATOMKI results as well as dedicated experiments to search for the proposed new excitations of ${\rm ^4He}$ and other $\alpha$-cluster nuclei.</description>

      <title>Rare and exclusive few-body decays of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an extensive survey of rare and exclusive few-body decays -- defined as those with branching fractions $\mathcal{B} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ into two to four final particles -- of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark. Such rare decays can probe physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), constitute a background for exotic decays into new BSM particles, and provide precise information on quantum chromodynamics factorization with small nonperturbative corrections. We tabulate the theoretical $\mathcal{B}$ values for about 200 rare decay channels of the four heaviest elementary particles, indicating the current experimental limits in their observation. Among those, we have computed for the first time ultrarare Higgs boson decays into photons and/or neutrinos, H and Z radiative decays into leptonium states, radiative H and Z quark-flavour-changing decays, and semiexclusive top-quark decays into a quark plus a meson, while updating predictions for a few other rare H, Z, and top quark partial widths. The feasibility of measuring each of these unobserved decays is estimated for p-p collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), and for $e^+e^-$ and p-p collisions at the future circular collider (FCC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $pp \to W^{\pm} h, Zh$ processes at the LHC are studied in the framework of the inert doublet model (IDM). To quantify the effects of the IDM and their observability in these processes we revisit the NLO (QCD and EW) predictions in the Standard Model (SM) and their uncertainty. Taking all available current constraints on the parameter space of the IDM, we consider both the case of the IDM providing a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate within the freeze-out mechanism as well as when the DM restrictions are relaxed. In the former, deviations from the SM of only a few per mil in these cross sections at the LHC are found and may not be measured. In the latter, the deviations can reach a few percents and should be observable. Smaller discrepancies in this case require that the theoretical uncertainties be improved, in particular those arising from the parton distribution functions (PDFs). We stress the importance of the photon-induced real corrections and the need for further improvement in the extraction of the photon PDF. The analysis also showcases the development and exploitation of our automated tool for the computation of one-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for a New Physics model with internal tests such as those concerning the soft and collinear parts provided through both dipole subtraction and phase space slicing besides tests for ultra-violet finiteness and gauge-parameter independence.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum-Dependent Heavy-Quark Fragmentation at Next-to-Leading Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transverse momentum-dependent fragmentation functions (TMD FFs) of heavy (bottom and charm) quarks, which we recently introduced, are universal building blocks that enter predictions for a large number of observables involving final-state heavy quarks or hadrons. They enable the extension of fixed-order subtraction schemes to quasi-collinear limits, and are of particular interest in their own right as probes of the nonperturbative dynamics of hadronization. In this paper we calculate all TMD FFs involving heavy quarks and the associated TMD matrix element in heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) to next-to-leading order in the strong interaction. Our results confirm the renormalization properties, large-mass, and small-mass consistency relations predicted in our earlier work. We also derive and confirm a prediction for the large-$z$ behavior of the heavy-quark TMD FF by extending, for the first time, the formalism of joint resummation to capture quark mass effects in heavy-quark fragmentation. Our final results in position space agree with those of a recent calculation by another group that used a highly orthogonal organization of singularities in the intermediate momentum-space steps, providing a strong independent cross check. As an immediate application, we present the complete quark mass dependence of the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in the back-to-back limit at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$.</description>

      <title>Probing superheavy dark matter through lunar radio observations of ultrahigh-energy neutrinos and the impacts of neutrino cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy neutrinos (UHE$\nu$s) can be used as a valuable probe of superheavy dark matter above $\sim 10^9$ GeV, the latter being difficult to probe with collider and direct detection experiments due to the feebly interacting nature. Searching for radio emissions originating from the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the lunar regolith enables us to explore energies beyond $10^{12}$ GeV, which astrophysical accelerators cannot achieve. Taking into account the interaction of UHE$\nu$s with the cosmic neutrino background and resulting standard neutrino cascades to calculate the neutrino flux on Earth, for the first time, we investigate sensitivities of such lunar radio observations to very heavy dark matter. We also examine the impacts of cosmogenic neutrinos that have the astrophysical origin. We show that the proposed ultra-long wavelength lunar radio telescope, as well as the existing low-frequency array, can provide the most stringent constraints on decaying or annihilating superheavy dark matter with masses at $\gtrsim 10^{12}$ GeV. The limits are complementary to or even stronger than those from other UHE$\nu$ detectors, such as the IceCube-Gen2 radio array and GRAND.</description>

      <title>Neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the neutrino transition magnetic moment in the $U(1)_X$SSM. $U(1)_X$SSM is the $U(1)$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its local gauge group is extended to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_X$. To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to the MSSM, which can explain the results of neutrino oscillation experiments. The neutrino transition magnetic moment is induced by electroweak radiative corrections. By applying effective Lagrangian method and on-shell scheme, we study the associated Feynman diagrams and the transition magnetic moment of neutrinos in the model. We fit experimental data for neutrino mass variances and mixing angle. Based on the range of data selection, the influences of different sensitive parameters on the results are analysed. The numerical analysis shows that many parameters have an effect on the neutrino transition moment, such as $g_X$, $M_2$, $\lambda_H$ and $g_{YX}$. For our numerical results, the order of magnitude of $\mu_{ij}^M/\mu_B$ is around $10^{-20}$ $\sim$ $10^{-19}$.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 314.5$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A light (GeV mass) long-lived ($c\tau$ around dozens of millimeters) CP-odd scalar can be readily predicted in new physics models. In this work we investigate the Higgs decay into such a light scalar plus a $Z$-boson and take the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) as an example. This light long-lived scalar, with the dominant decay to tau leptons, will fly over a distance from the production point and present a displaced vertex in an Inner Detector of a generally purposed experiment like ATLAS or CMS. In our study we focus on the LHC experiment and perform Monte Carlo simulations for the signal and backgrounds. We demonstrate some benchmark points for the aligned 2HDM and find the signal to be detectable when the luminosity is accumulated to 300 fb$^{-1}$. So our study suggests an experimental search for this process in the ongoing LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Dark Sink uses dark-sector interactions to siphon energy from dark matter to lighter dark degrees of freedom, i.e. dark radiation. Here, we extend dark matter models containing a Dark Sink to sub-MeV masses. We consider a Dark Sink model where the dark matter is charged under a light dark photon that has kinetic mixing with the Standard Model. For sub-MeV dark matter masses, plasmon decays are the dominant mechanism for transferring energy to the dark sector. Relative to a standard freeze-in cosmology, reproducing the observed dark matter density in a Dark Sink structure requires an increase in the dark matter couplings to the Standard Model, and hence increased direct detection cross sections. These models provide benchmarks for current and upcoming direct detection experiments. Accounting for plasmon effects, we derive the range of possible dark matter masses and cross sections for Dark Sink models in the sub-MeV regime. We make code available to reproduce our benchmarks; it may be of use for other freeze-in scenarios, including those where plasmon decays to the dark matter are important.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of a non-extensive quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16528v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the non-extensive statistical mechanics and the gluon polarization tensor obtained from kinetic theory, we derive the longitudinal and transverse gluon self-energies for the quark-gluon plasma. The electric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\mu_M$ are evaluated from the gluon self-energies through which the real part of the square of the refraction index ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ are investigated. The real part of $\varepsilon$ displays a frequency pole $\omega_d=p$, which is just the position of the frequency inflexion of the imaginary part of $\varepsilon$. The non-extensive parameter $q$ significantly affects the real and imaginary parts of $\varepsilon$ in the space-like region $\omega&lt;p$, while the frequency pole $\omega_d=p$ remains unchanged as $q$ increases. The magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ diverge at frequency $\omega_m$. As $q$ increases, the pole frequency $\omega_m$ shifts to large frequency region. The Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ becomes negative in a quite large frequency region $\omega\in[\omega_c, \omega_m]$. When $q$ increases, the frequency range for $n_{DL}&lt;0$ becomes wider. Nevertheless, there are no propagating modes for the negative refraction. In addition, as momentum $p$ increases, the electric permittivity, the magnetic permeability, ${\rm Re}\, n^2$ and $n_{DL}$ are sensitive to the change of $p$, which indicates the importance of the spatial dispersion in the electromagnetic responses of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Implication of the Weizsacker-Williams approximation for the dark matter mediator production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplified connection between Standard Model (SM) particles and light dark matter (LDM) can be introduced via spin-0 and spin-1 lepton-specific mediators. Moreover, in a mediator mass range from sub-MeV to sub-GeV, fixed-target facilities such as NA64$e$, LDMX, NA64$\mu$, and M$^3$ can potentially probe such particles of the hidden sector via missing energy signatures that are described by the bremsstrahlung-like process involving leptons. We compare the Weizsaker-Williams (WW) approximation and the exact tree-level (ETL) approach for the bremsstrahlung-like mediator production cross section by choosing various parameters of the fixed-target experiments. We show that the relative difference between the total cross sections calculated in the WW and ETL approximation varies from $\mathcal{O}(1)~\%$ to $\mathcal{O}(10)~\%$ for a muon mode and from $\mathcal{O}(-20)~\%$ to $\mathcal{O}(80)~\%$ for an electron mode. We argue that the main difference between two approaches for electron beam mode arises from peak forward region of the cross section. We also discuss the impact of parametrization of nuclear and atomic elastic form-factors on the total cross section. In particular, we show that the employing different form-factor parametrization can lead to a uncertainty in the cross section at the level of $\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\%$. That study may be helpful for the lepton fixed-target experiments that examine the bremsstrahlung-like production of the DM mediators.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) by comparing the role of elastic and inelastic (radiative) processes in the sQGP medium within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM), constructed for the description of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phenomena of the sQGP in line with the lattice QCD (lQCD) equation of state. First, we present the results for the energy and temperature dependencies of the total radiative cross sections and compare them to the corresponding elastic cross sections. Second, we perform a calculation of the interaction rate and relaxation time of radiative versus elastic scatterings. Finally, we obtain the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and investigate its dependence on the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we give a definitive basis for the dimension-eight operators leading to quartic -- but no cubic -- interactions among electroweak gauge bosons. These are often called anomalous quartic gauge couplings, or aQGCs. We distinguish in particular the CP-even ones from their CP-odd counterparts.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan Transverse-Momentum Spectra at N$^3$LL$'$ and Approximate N$^4$LL with SCETlib</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide state-of-the-art precision QCD predictions for the fiducial $W$ and $Z$ boson transverse momentum spectra at the LHC at N$^3$LL$'$ and approximate N$^4$LL in resummed perturbation theory, matched to available $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ fixed-order results. Our predictions consistently combine all information from across the spectrum in a unified way, ranging from the nonperturbative region of small transverse momenta to the fixed-order tail, with an emphasis on estimating the magnitude of residual perturbative uncertainties, and in particular of those related to the matching. Parametric uncertainties related to the strong coupling, the collinear PDFs, and the nonperturbative transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) dynamics are studied in detail. To assess the latter, we explicitly demonstrate how the full complexity of flavor and Bjorken $x$-dependent TMD dynamics can be captured by a single, effective nonperturbative function for the resonant production of any given vector boson at a given collider. We point out that the cumulative $p_T^Z$ cross section at the level of precision enabled by our predictions provides strong constraining power for PDF determinations at full N$^3$LO.</description>

      <title>Probing Millicharged Particles at an Electron Beam Dump with Ultralow-Threshold Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to search for millicharged particles produced in high-intensity electron beam dumps using small ultralow-threshold sensors. As a concrete example, we consider a Skipper-CCD placed behind the beam dump in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. We compute the millicharged particle flux, including both electromagnetic cascade and meson productions emanating from an aluminum target. We find that the sensitivity of a modest 2x14 array of Skipper-CCDs can exceed the sensitivity of all existing searches for millicharged particle masses below 1.5 GeV, and is either competitive or world leading when compared to other proposed experiments. Our results demonstrate that small-scale ultralow threshold silicon devices can enhance the reach of accelerator-based experiments, while fitting comfortably within existing experimental halls.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the $\psi(4160)$ Resonance Parameter Using $B^+\to K^+\mu^+\mu^-$ Data in the Context of Unquenched Charmonium Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A puzzling phenomenon, where the measured mass of the $\psi(4160)$ is pushed higher, presents a challenge to current theoretical models of hadron spectroscopy. This study suggests that the issue arises from analyses based on the outdated quenched charmonium spectrum. In the past two decades, the discovery of new hadronic states has emphasized the importance of the unquenched effect. Under the unquenched picture, six vector charmonium states-$\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $\psi(4220)$, $\psi(4380)$, $\psi(4415)$, and $\psi(4500)$-are identified in the $4 \sim 4.5$ GeV range, contrasting with the three states predicted in the quenched model. We reevaluate the resonance parameters of the $\psi(4160)$ using the di-muon invariant mass spectrum of $B^+ \to K^+ \mu^+ \mu^-$ and unquenched charmonium spectroscopy. Our analysis finds the $\psi(4160)$ mass at $4145.76 \pm 4.48$ MeV, indicating previous overestimations. This conclusion is supported by analyzing $e^+e^- \to D_s \bar{D}_s^*$. Our findings have significant implications for both hadron spectroscopy and search for new physics signals by $R_K$.</description>

      <title>The Two Scales of New Physics in Loop-Induced Higgs Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing new physics through precise measurements of Higgs boson couplings is a central objective of the particle collider program at the high-energy frontier. An anomaly in Higgs couplings induced solely by new fermions allows one to compute an upper bound on the mass scale of new bosons. This new bosonic scale is necessary to prevent Landau poles or vacuum instability. Consequently, a single anomalous measurement can provide insight into two distinct new physics scales. In this article, we apply this approach to the loop-induced couplings of the Higgs boson to digluons ($gg$), diphotons ($\gamma \gamma$), and $Z \gamma$, and we compare our results to the projected sensitivities of the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. This work naturally extends our previous analysis of Higgs couplings to weak dibosons ($WW$ and $ZZ$).</description>

      <title>Leptophilic Axion-like Particles at Forward Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs) exhibit rich phenomenology, focusing exclusively on interactions between an ALP and Standard Model (SM) leptons. Through integration by parts, it is shown that both the three-point interaction, $a\bar\ell\ell$ and the four-point interaction, $a\ell^-\nu W^+$, play significant roles, making the flavor portal particularly compelling. For ALPs with masses ranging from $\mathcal O(1)$ MeV to $\mathcal O(1)$ GeV, they can contribute to exotic hadron decays. Suppressed couplings naturally extend the ALP lifetime, presenting opportunities for detection at forward detectors. In this study, we explore ALPs with both electrophilic and muonphilic scenarios. We propose an inclusive search for various hadrons that undergo exotic decays at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the electrophilic scenario, long-lived ALPs are searched in the Forward Search Experiment (FASER) and its upgrading phase, FASER II. In the muonphilic scenario, where the ALP lifetime is significantly reduced due to its coupling to muons, we further investigate its detection potential at LHCb and its high-luminosity upgrade. Several benchmarks are analyzed, including electroweak-preserving, electroweak-violating and left-right softly asymmetric models, to demonstrate possible experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Roles of the $N(1535)$ and $a_0(980)$ in the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the process $\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n$ by taking into account the contributions from the nucleon resonance $N(1535)$ and the scalar meson $a_0(980)$, which could be dynamically generated by the interaction of the $S$-wave pseudosalar meson-octet baryon and the $S$-wave pseudosalar meson-pseudosalar meson, respectively. Our results show that, in $\eta n$ invariant mass distribution, there is a significant near-threshold enhancement structure, which could be associated with $N(1535)$. On the other hand, one can find a clear cusp structure of $a_0(980)$ in $\pi^+\eta$ invariant mass distribution. We further estimate the ratio $R$ = $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to a_0(980)^+ n)/\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to \pi^+\eta n)\approx 0.313$. Our results can be tested by BESIII, Belle~II, and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics with the Electron Yukawa coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dedicated run of a future electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) at a center-of-mass energy equal to the Higgs boson mass would enable a direct measurement of the electron Yukawa coupling. However, it poses substantial experimental difficulties due to large backgrounds, the requirement for monochromatised $e^+e^-$ beams, and the potential extension of the FCC-ee timeline. Given this, we explore the extent to which the electron Yukawa coupling can be enhanced in simplified UV models and examine whether such scenarios can be constrained by other FCC-ee runs or upcoming experiments at the intensity frontier. Our results indicate that in certain classes of models, the $(g-2)_e$ provides a probe of the electron Yukawa coupling that is as effective or better than the FCC-ee. Nevertheless, there exist models that can lead to sizeable deviations in the electron Yukawa coupling which can only be probed in a dedicated run at the Higgs pole mass.</description>

      <title>Optimizers for Stabilizing Likelihood-free Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing number of applications in particle physics and beyond use neural networks as unbinned likelihood ratio estimators applied to real or simulated data. Precision requirements on the inference tasks demand a high-level of stability from these networks, which are affected by the stochastic nature of training. We show how physics concepts can be used to stabilize network training through a physics-inspired optimizer. In particular, the Energy Conserving Descent (ECD) optimization framework uses classical Hamiltonian dynamics on the space of network parameters to reduce the dependence on the initial conditions while also stabilizing the result near the minimum of the loss function. We develop a version of this optimizer known as $ECD_{q=1}$, which has few free hyperparameters with limited ranges guided by physical reasoning. We apply $ECD_{q=1}$ to representative likelihood-ratio estimation tasks in particle physics and find that it out-performs the widely-used Adam optimizer. We expect that ECD will be a useful tool for wide array of data-limited problems, where it is computationally expensive to exhaustively optimize hyperparameters and mitigate fluctuations with ensembling.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with a promising solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes surrounded by axions, then they may allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly enough via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~1 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to be quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a transition state between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of strange mesons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Determination of the $K^+\bar{K}^0$ scattering length and effective range from the $D^+\to\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta$ reaction</title>

Abstract: We study the scattering parameters of the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) system through the analysis of the \(D^+\to\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta\) reaction, aiming at determining the scattering length \(a\) and effective range \(r_0\) of the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) interaction. These parameters are extracted by analyzing and fitting the mass distributions of the pairs in the final \(\bar{K}^0\pi^+\eta\) state. To ensure the reliability of the results, we apply resampling techniques to evaluate statistical uncertainties and improve the precision of the scattering parameters. The obtained results are compared with previous theoretical predictions and experimental data, providing new insights into the \(K^+\bar{K}^0\) interaction at low energies.</description>

      <title>The potential for string backgrounds from string geometry theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of the non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this paper, in the bosonic closed sector of string geometry theory, we identify string background configurations, which include general string backgrounds in bosonic closed string theory. From fluctuations around these configurations, we derive the path-integrals of perturbative strings on the string backgrounds up to any order. Furthermore, the identification of the string background configurations enables us to obtain differential equations that determine a potential for string backgrounds. We obtain a potential for perturbative vacua in string theory by substituting the string background configurations into the classical potential in string geometry theory and imposing the differential equations by the method of Lagrange multipliers. We also solve these differential equations and obtain a potential explicitly up to the second order without Lagrange multipliers.</description>

      <title>A novel strategy to prove chiral symmetry breaking in QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral symmetry breaking occurs in the confining regime of QCD-like theories with $N_c$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. Our proof is based on a novel strategy, called `downlifting', by which solutions of the 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions for a theory with $N_f-1$ flavors are constructed from those of a theory with $N_f$ flavors, while $N_c$ is fixed. By induction, chiral symmetry breaking is proven for any $N_f\geq p_{min}$ in the confining regime, where $p_{min}$ is the smallest prime factor of $N_c$. The proof can be extended to $N_f &lt;p_{min}$ under the additional assumption on the absence of phase transitions when quark masses are sent to infinity. Our results do not rely on assumptions on the spectrum of massless bound states other than the fact that they are color-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this brief article, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression, taking into account the appropriate timescales resulting from both physical and instrumental constraints. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a hundredth of an astronomical unit - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, suboptimal, and general trajectories. The main conclusion is that detection seems clearly out of reach.</description>

      <title>The LISA forecast on a smooth crossover beyond the Standard Model through the scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supposing the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave (GW) detector, we exhibit the detectability of a hypothetical smooth crossover in the early universe beyond the Standard Model of particle physics through the scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) in terms of the Fisher forecast. A crossover at $\sim100\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can leave a signal on the GW spectrum in the $\sim\mathrm{mHz}$ frequency range, the sweet spot of the LISA sensitivity. These possibilities are also interesting in the primordial black hole (PBH) context as the associated PBH mass $\sim10^{22}\,\mathrm{g}$ lies at the window to explain the whole dark matter. We found that the properties of the crossover can be well determined if the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations are as large as $\sim5\times10^{-4}$ on the corresponding scale $\sim10^{12}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect and the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect considers the situation in which the magnetic flux inside the solenoid changes time-dependently. Different from the standard AB-effect, the problem is unexpectedly subtle and not easy to solve without any doubt, which is the reason why it is still in a state of unsettlement even theoretically. The difficulty originates from the fact that its theoretical analysis requires line-integrals of the time-dependent vector potential along paths in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space. Owing to the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, this closed line-integral of the vector potential can be related to the integral of the electric and magnetic fields over the 2-dimensional area, the boundary of which is given by the above-mentioned closed path. The central controversy concerns the success or failure of the claim by Singleton and collaborators based on the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem, which states that the time-dependent part of the AB-phase shift due to the magnetic vector potential is precisely cancelled by the effect of induced electric field generated by the time-variation of the magnetic flux. In the present paper, we carefully reanalyze their cancellation argument by going back to the basic quantum mechanical analysis of the charged particle motion under the presence of the time-dependent external electromagnetic potential combined with more careful treatment of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem. Careful analysis of the 4-dimensional Stokes theorem shows that the cancellation argument by Singleton et al. is partially correct but their central claim that only the time-independent part of the magnetic field contributes to the AB-phase shift so that there is no time-dependent AB-effect is not justified, thereby supporting likely existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Sharpness of the Curvature Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that a sharply peaked curvature spectrum is often considered in the literature, we examine theoretical constraints on the sharpness of such a spectrum. In particular, we show that the sharply peaked curvature power spectrum, originating from the enhancement of subhorizon perturbations during inflation, is significantly constrained by energy conservation. While the constraints do not depend on the exact form of inflaton potential, we also study concrete inflaton potentials that realize a sharply peaked curvature spectrum and how theoretical limits are saturated in these cases.</description>

      <title>Exact relations between running of $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <title>A two-body femtoscopy approach to the proton-deuteron correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composite deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions, we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation without relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation by incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Trace Anomaly Action and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>
