      <title>Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries provide a promising approach to understand the flavor sector of the standard model of particle physics. Top-down (TD) explanations from string theory reveal two different types of such flavor symmetries: traditional and modular flavor symmetries that combine to the eclectic flavor group. There have been many bottom-up (BU) constructions to fit experimental data within this scheme. We compare TD and BU constructions to identify the most promising groups and try to give a unified description. Although there is some progress in joining BU and TD approaches, we point out some gaps that have to be closed with future model building.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T\bar {T}$ deformation from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the existence of complex spectrum in $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs, in this paper we revisit the broadly studied topic of (holographic) entanglement entropy in the deformed theory to investigate its complex behaviour. As a concrete example, we show that in case of a 1+1 dimensional holographic CFT at finite temperature $\beta^{-1}$ and chemical potential $\Omega$, the holographic entanglement entropy in the deformed theory remains to be real only within the range $-\frac{\beta^2}{8\pi^2}\frac{(1-\Omega^2)^2}{\Omega^2}&lt; \mu &lt; \frac{\beta^2}{8\pi^2}(1-\Omega^2) $ of the deformation parameter. While the upper bound overlaps with the familiar Hagedorn bound in the deformed theory, the novel lower bound on the negative values of the deformation parameter does not show up in thermodynamic quantities. However, from a holographic perspective we show that this intriguing lower bound is related to a spacelike to null transition of the associated Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the deformed geometry. We also investigate the Quantum Null Energy Condition in the deformed theory, within its regime of validity.</description>

      <title>Magic zeroes in the black hole response problem and a Love symmetry resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present the emergence of an $SL(2,R)$ ("Love") symmetry in the suitably defined near-zone region, relevant for studying the black hole response problem. This symmetry is globally defined and physical solutions of the black hole linearized field equations are closed under its action. The vanishing of static Love numbers is found to naturally arise as a selection rule following from the fact that the relevant solution belongs to a particular highest-weight representation of the Love symmetry. Interestingly, the Love symmetry appears to be connected to the well-known enhanced $SL(2,R)$ isometry subgroup of the near-horizon extremal geometry. Namely, the Love symmetry exactly reduces to the isometry of the near-horizon AdS$_2$ throat for extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, while, for rotating black holes, one is lead to consider an infinite-dimensional $SL(2,R)\ltimes\hat{U}(1)_V$ extension of the Love symmetry, a family of subalgebras of which precisely recovers the Killing vectors of the corresponding AdS$_2$ throat in the extremal limit. Similar results persist when studying perturbations of general-relativistic black holes in higher dimensions. Even though the black hole static Love numbers now vanish only for a discrete set of resonant conditions that depends on the orbital number of the perturbation, Love symmetry exists independently of these details. This hints at a geometric interpretation of the Love symmetry; a statement that becomes more rigorous within the framework of subtracted geometries. However, Love symmetry appears to be theory-dependent. We extract, in particular, a sufficient geometric condition for its existence according to which, for instance, it does not exist in Riemann$^3$ gravity or some stringy-corrected low-energy effective gravitational actions, in accordance with explicit computations of the corresponding black hole Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras II: Vertex function and beyond quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of generalized gauge theory called gauge origami, based on the quantum algebraic approach initiated in [arXiv:2310.08545]. In this article, we in particular explore the D2 brane system realized by the screened vertex operators of the corresponding W-algebra. The partition function of this system given by the corresponding conformal block is identified with the vertex function associated with quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties and generalizations, that plays a central role in the quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence. Based on the quantum algebraic perspective, we address three new aspects of the correspondence: (i) Direct equivalence between the electric and magnetic blocks by constructing stable envelopes from the chamber structure of the vertex operators, (ii) Double affine generalization of quantum $q$-Langlands correspondence, and (iii) Conformal block realization of the origami vertex function associated with intersection of quasimaps, that realizes the higher-rank multi-leg Pandharipande-Thomas vertices of 3-fold and 4-fold.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Anomalies of QCD$_3$ and QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies of global symmetry provide powerful tool to constrain the dynamics of quantum systems, such as anomaly matching in the renormalization group flow and obstruction to symmetric mass generation. In this note we compute the anomalies in 2+1d time-reversal symmetric gauge theories with massless fermions in the fundamental and rank-two tensor representations, where the gauge groups are $SU(N),SO(N),Sp(N),U(1)$. The fermion parity is part of the gauge group and the theories are bosonic. The time-reversal symmetry satisfies $T^2=1$ or $T^2={\cal M}$ where ${\cal M}$ is an internal magnetic symmetry.
  We show that some of the bosonic gauge theories have time-reversal anomaly with $c_-\neq 0$ mod 8 that is absent in fermionic systems. The anomalies of the gauge theories can be nontrivial even when the number of Majorana fermions is a multiple of 16 and $\nu=0$.</description>

      <title>A two parameter family of lightcone-like hyperbolic string vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of string field theory vertices, which we refer to as hyperbolic Kaku vertices. It is defined in terms of hyperbolic metrics on the Riemann surface, but the geometry is allowed to depend on inputs of the states. The vertices are defined for both open and closed strings. In either case, the family contains the hyperbolic vertices. Then we show that the open string lightcone vertex is obtained as the flat limit of the hyperbolic Kaku vertices. The open string Kaku vertices, which interpolate between the Witten vertex and the open string lightcone vertex, is also obtained as a flat limit. We use the same limit on the case of closed strings to define the closed string Kaku vertices: a one parameter family of vertices that interpolates between the polyhedral vertices - which are covariant, but not cubic - and the closed string lightcone vertex - which is cubic, but not Lorentz covariant.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Singularity from OPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eternal asymptotically AdS black holes are dual to thermofield double states in the boundary CFT. It has long been known that black hole singularities have certain signatures in boundary thermal two-point functions related to null geodesics bouncing off the singularities (bouncing geodesics). In this paper we shed light on the manifestations of black hole singularities in the dual CFT. We decompose the boundary CFT correlator of scalar operators using the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and focus on the contributions from the identity, the stress tensor, and its products. We show that this part of the correlator develops singularities precisely at the points that are connected by bulk bouncing geodesics. Black hole singularities are thus encoded in the analytic behavior of the boundary correlators determined by multiple stress tensor exchanges. Furthermore, we show that in the limit where the conformal dimension of the operators is large, the sum of multi-stress-tensor contributions develops a branch point singularity as predicted by the geodesic analysis. We also argue that the appearance of complexified geodesics, which play an important role in computing the full correlator, is related to the contributions of the double-trace operators in the boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping for massive fields and the Stueckelberg formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pole-skipping refers to the special phenomenon that the pole and the zero of a retarded two-point Green's function coincide at certain points in momentum space. We study the pole-skipping phenomenon in holographic Green's functions of boundary operators that are dual to massive $p$-form fields and the dRGT massive gravitational fields in the AdS black hole background. Pole-skipping points for these systems are computed using the near horizon method. The relation between the pole-skipping points of massive fields and their massless counterparts is revealed. In particular, as the field mass $m$ is varied from zero to non-zero, the pole-skipping phenomenon undergoes an abrupt change with doubled pole-skipping points found in the massive case. This arises from the breaking of gauge invariance due to the mass term and the consequent appearance of more degrees of freedom. We recover the gauge invariance using the Stueckelberg formalism by introducing auxiliary dynamical fields. The extra pole-skipping points are identified to be associated with the Stueckelberg fields. We also observe that, as the mass varies, some pole-skipping points of the wave number $q$ may move from a non-physical region with complex $q$ to a physical region with real $q$.</description>

      <title>Holographic $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface defects in ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity with $\mathfrak{osp}(6|2)$ superconformal algebra recently constructed in \cite{Macpherson:2023cbl}. These solutions are foliations over an interval preserving $\mathcal{N}=(0,6)$ supersymmetry in two dimensions, that in the massless limit can be mapped to the $\text{AdS}_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ solution of ABJM/ABJ. We show that in the massive case extra NS5-D8 branes, that we interpret as $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface defect branes within the ABJ theory, backreact in the geometry and turn one of the 3d field theory directions onto an energy scale, generating a flow towards a 2d CFT. We construct explicit quiver field theories that we propose flow in the IR to the $(0,6)$ SCFTs dual to the solutions. Finally, we show that the $\text{AdS}_3$ solutions realise geometrically, in terms of large gauge transformations, an extension to the massive case of Seiberg duality in ABJ theories proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Curvature Correlators in Nonperturbative 2D Lorentzian Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions are ubiquitous tools in quantum field theory from both a fundamental and a practical point of view. However, up to now their use in theories of quantum gravity beyond perturbative and asymptotically flat regimes has been limited, due to difficulties associated with diffeomorphism invariance and the dynamical nature of geometry. We present an analysis of a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, nonperturbative two-point curvature correlator in two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the recently introduced quantum Ricci curvature and uses a lattice regularization of the full path integral in terms of causal dynamical triangulations. We discuss some of the subtleties and ambiguities in defining connected correlators in theories of dynamical geometry, and provide strong evidence from Monte Carlo simulations that the connected two-point curvature correlator in 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity vanishes. This work paves the way for an analogous investigation in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the canonical ensemble and isothermal-isobaric ensemble and apply it to the cases of non-rotating BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild black holes. This is realized by generalizing the equations obtained using Boltzmann-Gibbs(BG) statistics with its relativistic generalization, Kaniadakis statistics, or $\kappa$-statistics. The relativistic corrections are found to be logarithmic in nature and it is observed that their effect becomes appreciable in the high-temperature limit suggesting that the entropy corrections must include these relativistically corrected terms while taking the aforementioned limit. The non-relativistic corrections are recovered in the $\kappa\rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that the Semiclassical Einstein's Field Equation can be recovered using the generalized entropy $S_{gen}$. This approach is reminiscent of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, contrary to the entanglement equilibrium approach of deriving the semiclassical Einstein's equation, this approach does not require any such assumptions and still recovers its correct form. Therefore, in a sense, we also show the validity of the semiclassical approximation, a crucial approach for establishing a number of important ideas such as the Hawking effect.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical limit of the recently proposed coherent spin foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. Specifically, we analyze the gluing equations derived from the stationary phase approximation of the vertex amplitude. Typically these exhibit two solutions yielding a cosine of the Regge action. However, by inspection of the algebraic equations as well as their geometrical realization, we show in this note that the behavior is more nuanced: when all triangles are either spacelike or timelike, two solutions exist.

      <title>Covariant phase space analysis of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity with boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel prescription for the expression of the thermodynamic potentials associated with the couplings of a Lanczos-Lovelock theory. These potentials emerge in theories with multiple couplings, where the ratio between them provide intrinsic length scales that break scale invariance. Our prescription, derived from the covariant phase space formalism, differs from previous approaches by enabling the construction of finite potentials without reference to any background. To do so, we consistently work with finite-size systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions and rigorously take into account boundary and corner terms: including these terms is found to be crucial for relaxing the integrability conditions for phase space quantities that were required in previous works. We apply this prescription to the first law of (extended) thermodynamics for stationary black holes, and derive a version of the Smarr formula that holds for static black holes with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Avoiding singularities in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes: the role of atemporality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Schwarzschild metric exhibiting a signature change across the event horizon, which gives rise to what we term a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole. The resulting geometry is regularized by employing the Hadamard partie finie technique, which allows us to prove that the metric represents a solution of vacuum Einstein equations. In this framework, we introduce the concept of atemporality as the dynamical mechanism responsible for the transition from a regime with a real-valued time variable to a new one featuring an imaginary time. We show that this mechanism prevents the occurrence of the singularity and, by means of the regularized Kretschmann invariant, we discuss in which terms atemporality can be considered as the characteristic feature of this black hole.</description>

      <title>Inflation via Moduli Potentials in a Nested Warped Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by assuming predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>

      <title>From infinite to infinitesimal: Using the Universe as a dataset to probe Casimir corrections to the vacuum energy from fields inhabiting the dark dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Promptly after high-resolution experiments harbinger the field of precision cosmology low- and high-redshift observations abruptly gave rise to a tension in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe ($H_0$) and the clustering of matter ($S_8$). The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions. This setup relies on an empirical conjecture, which postulates that $\Lambda$ switched sign (from negative to positive) at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. We reexamine a stringy model that can describe the transition in the vacuum energy hypothesized in $\Lambda_s$CDM. The model makes use of the Casimir forces driven by fields inhabiting the incredible bulk of the dark dimension scenario. Unlike the $\Lambda_s$CDM setup the model deviates from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe due to the existence of relativistic neutrino-like species. Using the Boltzmann solver CLASS in combination with MontePython we confront predictions of the stringy model to experimental data (from the Planck mission, Pantheon+ supernova type Ia, BAO, and KiDS-1000). We show that the string-inspired model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and can resolve the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Walking behavior induced by $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking in a non-Hermitian $\rm XY$ model with clock anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum system governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian may exhibit zero temperature phase transitions that are driven by interactions, just as its Hermitian counterpart, raising the fundamental question how non-Hermiticity affects quantum criticality. In this context we consider a non-Hermitian system consisting of an $\rm XY$ model with a complex-valued four-state clock interaction that may or may not have parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. When the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken, and time-evolution becomes non-unitary, a scaling behavior similar to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition ensues, but in a highly unconventional way, as the line of fixed points is absent. From the analysis of the $d$-dimensional RG equations, we obtain that the unconventional behavior in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken regime follows from the collision of two fixed points in the $d\to 2$ limit, leading to walking behavior or pseudocriticality. For $d=2+1$ the near critical behavior is characterized by a correlation length exponent $\nu=3/8$, a value smaller than the mean-field one. These results are in sharp contrast with the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case where only one fixed point arises for $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and in $d=1+1$ three lines of fixed points occur with a continuously varying critical exponent $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Spiral flow of quantum quartic oscillator with energy cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of the quantum quartic oscillator is developed with close attention to the energy cutoff one needs to impose on the system in order to approximate the smallest eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of its Hamiltonian by diagonalizing matrices of limited size. The matrices are obtained by evaluating matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between the associated harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and by correcting the computed matrices to compensate for their limited dimension, using the Wilsonian renormalization-group procedure. The cutoff dependence of the corrected matrices is found to be described by a spiral motion of a three-dimensional vector. This behavior is shown to result from a combination of a limit-cycle and a floating fixed-point behaviors, a distinct feature of the foundational quantum system that warrants further study. A brief discussion of the research directions concerning renormalization of polynomial interactions of degree higher than four, spontaneous symmetry breaking and coupling of more than one oscillator through the near neighbor couplings known in condensed matter and quantum field theory, is included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Following arXiv:2210.12963 [hep-th], we investigate aspects of the time evolution operator regarded as a density operator and associated entanglement-like structures in various quantum systems. These involve timelike separations and generically lead to complex-valued entropy, although there are interesting real subfamilies. There are many parallels and close relations with reduced transition matrices and pseudo-entropy, which we discuss and clarify. For instance, a related quantity involves the time evolution operator along with a projection onto some initial state, which amounts to analysing pseudo-entropy for the initial state and its time-evolved final state.</description>

      <title>Mixed boundary conditions and Double-trace like deformations in Celestial holography and Wedge-like holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, adding a relevant double-trace deformation $f\int O^2$ to a holographic CFT action is dual to imposing mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions for the field dual to $O$ in AdS. We observed similar behaviour in codimension-two flat space holographies. We consider deformations of boundary conditions in flat spacetimes under flat space co-dimension-two holographies, celestial holography and Wedge-like holography. In the former celestial-holographic approach, we imposed boundary conditions on initial and final bulk states in the scattering. We find that these non-trivial boundary conditions in the bulk induce "double deformations" on the Celestial CFT side, which can be understood as an analogy of double trace deformations in the usual AdS/CFT. We compute two-point bulk scattering amplitudes under the non-trivial deformed boundary conditions. In the latter Wedge-like holography approach, we consider mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions on the null infinity of the light-cone. We find that this mixing induces a renormalization flow in the dual Wedge CFT side under the Wedge holography, as in the usual AdS/CFT. We argue that the discrepancy between the Wedge two-point function and the Celestial two-point function originates from a sensitivity of bulk massless fields to a regularization parameter to use the usual AdS/CFT techniques.</description>

Combined with non-factorization polynomial contact contributions from physical data for Kerr black holes, we can address high-spin-order covariant gravitational Compton amplitudes, identifying a pattern for the amplitude that we believe could extend to all orders in spin. Finally, we outline applications and outstanding questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems in arbitrary space-time dimensions where matter, deformed by $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-like irrelevant operators, is coupled to gravity in the Palatini formalism. The dynamically equivalent perspective is investigated, wherein the deformation transitions from the matter action to the gravitational one or vice versa. This alternative viewpoint leads to the emergence of Ricci-based gravity theories, thus providing a high-dimensional generalisation of the well-known equivalence between two-dimensional $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ deformations and coupling to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. This dynamical equivalence is examined within the framework of the recently introduced Lagrangian flow equation, which notably led to the discovery of a direct link between Nambu-Goto theory and $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$ in $d=2$, as well as significant insights into nonlinear electrodynamics models in $d=4$. The investigation involves explicit examples in $d=4$ dimensions; it builds upon earlier research concerning the metric interpretation of $\mathrm{T}\bar{\mathrm{T}}$-like perturbations, incorporates and extends recent findings in the cosmology-related literature associated to the concept of reframing. We focus on scenarios where the resulting modified gravity theories manifest as Born-Infeld and Starobinsky types.</description>

      <title>Love numbers and Love symmetries for $p$-form and gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The static Love numbers of four-dimensional asymptotically flat, isolated, general-relativistic black holes are known to be identically vanishing. The Love symmetry proposal suggests that such vanishings are addressed by selection rules following from the emergence of an enhanced $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ ("Love") symmetry in the near-zone region; more specifically, it is the fact that the black hole perturbations belong to a highest-weight representation of this near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry, rather than the existence of the Love symmetry itself, that outputs the vanishings of the corresponding Love numbers. In higher spacetime dimensions, some towers of magic zeroes with regards to the black hole response problem have also been reported for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Here, we extend these results by supplementing with $p$-form perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. We furthermore analytically extract the static Love numbers and the leading order dissipation numbers associated with spin-$0$ scalar and spin-$2$ tensor-type tidal perturbations of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We find that Love symmetries exist and that the vanishings of the static Love numbers are captured by representation theory arguments even for these higher spin perturbations of the higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes of General Relativity. Interestingly, these near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ structures acquire extensions to Witt algebras. Our setup allows to also study the $p$-form response problem of a static spherically symmetric black hole in a generic theory of gravity. We perform explicit computations for some black holes in the presence of string-theoretic corrections and investigate under what geometric conditions Love symmetries emerge in the near-zone.</description>

Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Lagrangian Formulation for Bosonic Continuous Spin Theory in Flat Spacetime of Arbitrary Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered two unconstrained forms of free Lagrangian for continuous spin(CS) theory in arbitrary flat spacetime dimension for bosonic case. These Lagrangians, unlike that by Schuster and Toro, do not include delta functions and are conventional. The first form consists of five kinds of totally symmetric helicity fields and one kind of gauge parameter. By introducing auxiliary creation and annihilation operators, each is combined into a state vector in Fock space, including all ranks one by one. The Lagrangian imposes no constraints, such as trace conditions, on these fields or the gauge parameter field. Additionally, the Lagrangian does not contain higher-order derivative terms. In the limit as CS parameter $\mu$ approaches zero, it naturally reproduces a Lagrangian for helicity fields in higher spin(HS) theory, known as unconstrained quartet formulation. Permitting third-order derivatives, we also obtain the second unconstrained form of Lagrangian that can be written in terms of three kinds of fields, including $\mu$, similar to the formulation by Francia and Sagnotti. Partial gauge fixing and partial use of equation of motion(EOM) on this Lagrangian yield a Fronsdal-like Lagrangian with a single double-traceless field, including $\mu$. By imposing further gauge fixing on the field in the EOM with respect to divergence and trace, we confirm the reproduction of the modified Wigner equations already known in literature.</description>

      <title>A volume-renormalized mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a geometric quantity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, which we call the volume-renormalized mass. It is essentially a linear combination of the ADM mass surface integral and a renormalization of the volume.
  We show that the volume-renormalized mass is well-defined and diffeomorphism invariant under weaker fall-off conditions than required to ensure that the renormalized volume and the ADM mass surface integral are well-defined separately. We prove several positivity results for the volume-renormalized mass. We also use it to define a renormalized Einstein--Hilbert action and a renormalized expander entropy which is nondecreasing under the Ricci flow. Further, we show that local maximizers of the entropy are local minimizers of the volume-renormalized mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non--commutativity as a Perturbation in the Schwarzschild Black Hole: Quasinormal Modes, Scattering, and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, by a novel approach to studying the scattering of a Schwarzschild black hole, the non-commutativity is introduced as a perturbation. We begin by reformulating the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field in a new form that takes into account the deformed non-commutative spacetime. Using this formulation, an effective potential for the scattering process is derived. To calculate the quasinormal modes, we employ the WKB method and also utilize fitting techniques to investigate the impact of non-commutativity on the scalar quasinormal modes. We thoroughly analyze the results obtained from these different methods. Moreover, the greybody factor and absorption cross section are investigated. Additionally, we explore the behavior of null geodesics in the presence of non-commutativity. Specifically, we examine the photonic, and shadow radius as well as the light trajectories for different non-commutative parameters. Therefore, by addressing these various aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of non-commutativity on the scattering of a Schwarzschild-like black hole and its implications for the behavior of scalar fields and light trajectories.</description>

      <title>Effective Action for Dissipative and Nonholonomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the action of a dynamical system can be supplemented by an effective action for its environment to reproduce arbitrary coordinate dependent ohmic dissipation and gyroscopic forces. The action is a generalization of the harmonic bath model and describes a set of massless interacting scalar fields in an auxiliary space coupled to the original system at the boundary. A certain limit of the model implements nonholonomic constraints. In the case of dynamics with nonlinearly realized symmetries the effective action takes the form of a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma-model. It provides a basis for application of path integral methods to general dissipative and nonholonomic systems.</description>

      <title>Screwon spectral statistics and dispersion relation in the quantum Rajeev-Ranken model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rajeev-Ranken (RR) model is a Hamiltonian system describing screw-type nonlinear waves (screwons) of wavenumber $k$ in a scalar field theory pseudodual to the 1+1D SU(2) principal chiral model. Classically, the RR model based on a quadratic Hamiltonian on a nilpotent/Euclidean Poisson algebra is Liouville integrable. Upon adopting canonical variables in a slightly extended phase space, the model was interpreted as a novel 3D cylindrically symmetric quartic oscillator with a rotational energy. Here, we examine the spectral statistics and dispersion relation of quantized screwons via numerical diagonalization validated by variational and perturbative approximations. We also derive a semiclassical estimate for the cumulative level distribution which compares favorably with the one from numerical diagonalization. The spectrum shows level crossings typical of an integrable system. The $i^{\rm th}$ unfolded nearest neighbor spacings are found to follow Poisson statistics for small $i$. Nonoverlapping spacing ratios also indicate that successive spectral gaps are independently distributed. After displaying universal linear behavior over energy windows of short lengths, the spectral rigidity saturates at a length and value that scales with the square-root of energy. For strong coupling $\lambda$ and intermediate $k$, we argue that reduced screwon energies can depend only on the product $\lambda k$. Numerically, we find power law dependences on $\lambda$ and $k$ with an approximately common exponent $2/3$ provided the angular momentum quantum number $l$ is small compared to the number of nodes $n$ in the radial wavefunction. On the other hand, for the ground state $n = l = 0$, the common exponent becomes 1.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Lie analogues of spin Sutherland models revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some generalizations of spin Sutherland models descend from `master integrable systems' living on Heisenberg doubles of compact semisimple Lie groups. The master systems represent Poisson--Lie counterparts of the systems of free motion modeled on the respective cotangent bundles and their reduction relies on taking quotient with respect to a suitable conjugation action of the compact Lie group. We present an enhanced exposition of the reductions and prove rigorously for the first time that the reduced systems possess the property of degenerate integrability on the dense open subset of the Poisson quotient space corresponding to the principal orbit type for the pertinent group action. After restriction to a smaller dense open subset, degenerate integrability on the generic symplectic leaves is demonstrated as well. The paper also contains a novel description of the reduced Poisson structure and a careful elaboration of the scaling limit whereby our reduced systems turn into the spin Sutherland models.</description>

      <title>On the semiclassical bounce with strong minimal assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of avoiding cosmological singularity with a bounce solution in the early Universe. The main finding is that simple and well-known semiclassical correction, which describes the mixing of radiation and gravity in the effective action, may provide an analytic solution with a bounce. The solution requires a positive beta function for the total radiation term and the contraction of the Universe at the initial instant. The numerical estimate shows that the bounce may occur in an acceptable range of energies, but only under strong assumptions about the particle physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether inflation in the early universe can be induced by an extra component of a five-dimensional ${\rm U(1)}$ gauge field in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime or not. We show that an effective potential obtained by quantum corrections can act as an inflaton potential by finding parameter regions consistent with Planck 2018 results. In our model, fields involved in inflation obey a different type of boundary condition from that of the visible particles, and a surviving Wilson line phase can play a specific role for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses. As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariance through Gauge Fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomena in gauge theory are often described in the physics literature via a specific choice of gauge. In foundational and philosophical discussions this is often criticized as introducing gauge dependence, and contrasted against (often aspirational) "gauge-invariant" descriptions of the physics. I argue, largely in the context of scalar electrodynamics, that this is misguided, and that descriptions of a physical process within a specific gauge are in fact gauge-invariant descriptions. However, most of them are non-local descriptions of that physics, and I suggest that this ought to be the real objection to such descriptions. I explore the unitary gauge as the exception to this nonlocality and consider its strengths and limitations, as well as (more briefly) its extension beyond scalar electrodynamics.</description>
