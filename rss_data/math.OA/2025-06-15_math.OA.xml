      <title>Rank metric isometries and determinant-preserving mappings on II$_1$-factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully describe the general form of a linear (or conjugate-linear) rank metric isometry on the Murray--von Neumann algebra associated with a II$_1$-factor. As an application, we establish Frobenius' theorem in the setting of II$_1$-factors, by showing that every determinant-preserving linear bijection between two II$_1$-factors is necessarily an isomorphism or an anti-isomorphism. This confirms the Harris--Kadison conjecture (1996).</description>

      <title>Gluing topological graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce regular closed subgraphs of Katsura's topological graphs and use them to generalize the notion of an adjunction space from topology. Our construction attaches a topological graph onto another via a regular factor map. In our main theorem, we prove that under suitable assumptions the C*-algebra of the adjunction graph is a pullback of the C*-algebras of the topological graphs being glued. It generalizes (and slightly improves) the pushout-to-pullback theorem proved in the context of discrete directed graphs by the third author and P. M. Hajac. Our result applied to homeomorphism C*-algebras recovers a special case of the well-known result stating that pullbacks of $\mathbb{Z}$-C*-algebras induce pullbacks of the respective crossed product C*-algebras. Furthermore, we show that the C*-algebras of odd-dimensional quantum balls of Hong and Szyma\'nski (which are known not to be graph C*-algebras) are topological graph C*-algebras and we recover the pullback structure of C*-algebras of odd-dimensional quantum spheres by gluing the topological graphs associated to the C*-algebras of the corresponding odd-dimensional quantum balls.</description>

      <title>Prime and semiprime Lie ideals in C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of Dixmier ideals developed in previous work, we show that every semiprime Lie ideal in a C*-algebra arises as the full normalizer subspace of a semiprime two-sided ideal. This leads to a concise description of all semiprime Lie ideals in terms of semiprime two-sided ideals, and an analogous description of prime Lie ideals in terms of prime two-sided ideals.
  For unital C*-algebras without characters, we obtain a natural bijection between (semi)prime two-sided ideals and (semi)prime Lie ideals, and it follows that a Lie ideal is fully noncentral if and only if it is not contained in any prime Lie ideal.</description>

      <title>Embeddings into the ultrapower of the Jiang-Su algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence of embeddings into ultrapowers of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ and the Razak-Jacelon algebra $\mathcal{W}$. More specifically, we show that the cone over any separable $C^*$-algebra embeds into the ultrapowers of both $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{W}$. We also show that the result for $\mathcal{Z}$ generalizes to separable and exact continuous fields of $C^*$-algebras for which one of the fibers embeds into the ultrapower of $\mathcal{Z}$, if this fiber is suitably well-behaved.</description>

      <title>$K$-stability of $C^*$-algebras generated by isometries and unitaries with twisted commutation relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove $K$-stability for a family of $C^*$-algebras, which are generated by a finite set of unitaries and isometries satisfying twisted commutation relations. This family includes the $C^*$-algebra of doubly non-commuting isometries and free twist of isometries.
  Next, we consider the $C^*$-algebra $A_{\mathcal{V}}$ generated by an $n$-tuple of $\mathcal{U}$-twisted isometries $\mathcal{V}$ with respect to a fixed $n\choose 2$-tuple $\mathcal{U}=\{U_{ij}:1\leq i&lt;j \leq n\}$ of commuting unitaries (see \cite{NarJaySur-2022aa}). Under the assumption that the spectrum of the commutative $C^*$-algebra generated by $(\{U_{ij}:1\leq i&lt;j \leq n\})$ does not contain any element of finite order in the torus group $\bbbt^{n\choose 2}$, we show that $A_{\mathcal{V}}$
  is $K$-stable. Finally, we prove the same result for the $C^*$-algebra generated by a tuple of free $\mathcal{U}$-twisted isometries.</description>

      <title>Lie ideals in properly infinite C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every Lie ideal in a unital, properly infinite C*-algebra is commutator equivalent to a unique two-sided ideal. It follows that the Lie ideal structure of such a C*-algebra is concisely encoded by its lattice of two-sided ideals. This answers a question of Robert in this setting.
  We obtain similar structure results for Lie ideals in unital, real rank zero C*-algebras without characters. As an application, we show that every Lie ideal in a von Neumann algebra is related to a unique two-sided ideal, which solves a problem of Bre\v{s}ar, Kissin, and Shulman.</description>

      <title>Divided Differences and Multivariate Holomorphic Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus for tuples in a commutative Banach algebra and establish a simple "na\"ive" extension to commuting tuples in a general Banach algebra. The approach is na\"ive in the sense that the na\"ively defined joint spectrum maybe too big. The advantage of the approach is that the functional calculus then is given by a simple concrete formula from which all its continuity properties can easily be derived.
  We apply this framework to multivariate functions arising as divided differences of a univariate function. This provides a rich set of examples to which our na\"ive calculus applies. Foremost, we offer a natural and straightforward proof of the Connes-Moscovici Rearrangement Lemma in the context of the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus. Secondly, we show that the Daletski-Krein type noncommutative Taylor expansion is a natural consequence of our calculus. Also Magnus' Theorem which gives a nonlinear differential equation for the $\log$ of the solutions to a linear matrix ODE follows naturally and easily from our calculus. Finally, we collect various combinatorial related formulas.</description>
