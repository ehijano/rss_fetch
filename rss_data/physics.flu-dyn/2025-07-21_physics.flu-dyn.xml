      <title>Thin filaments in Hele-Shaw cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recently derived filament model, the stability of fluid filaments in Hele-Shaw cells, driven by a constant pressure gradient, is studied. It is found that thin circular filaments grow if their initial radius exceeds a dimensionless critical radius. Further, linear stability of the axisymmetric solution reveals that all modes are stable for twice this critical radius, with modes becoming unstable for larger radii. A translating circular solution is found for asymptotically large radius, termed a `pinned circle'. These are thought to describe the observed non-linear growth of filament into circular-like solutions. The solutions exhibit a finite-time blow up in the pinned circle radius, attributed to the circle shedding mass as it grows. This report presents the results of a project undertaken by the first author at the Matrix Workshop Instabilities in Porous Media, April 3-23, 2024, under the supervision of the other authors.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithms enhanced by Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present research work proposes advancement for Data Assimilation strategies using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). More precisely, multi-fidelity and multi-level algorithms for the Ensemble Kalman Filter are enhanced by CNN tools, with the objective to reduce the discrepancy in the prediction between ensemble realizations performed with different models. The proposed methodology is assessed via the analysis of the flow through a cascade of NACA 0012 profiles for Reynolds $Re=1\,000$ and Mach $Ma=0.5$. Depending on the angle of attack $\alpha$, unsteady features of the flow can be observed. The results indicate that the usage of the CNN tools, which are trained using data from the DA procedure, significantly augments the accuracy of the low-fidelity models with little augmentation in computational costs. It is shown that the usage of the CNN tools provides a faster convergence of the Data Assimilation algorithms, which leads to a significant gain in terms of computational resources required.</description>

      <title>A predictive model for bubble-particle collisions in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of bubble-particle collisions is crucial to improving the efficiency of industrial processes such as froth flotation. Although such systems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger than the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case which consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the bubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a first step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a frozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between finite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from simulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a model where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based on the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted collision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3, and particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a Taylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and simulations for Froude number $Fr \leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble Stokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the model's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters indicates that particle inertia effects are usually important. Generally, smaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall collision rate.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of evaporating, interconnected droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the dynamics of a pair of sessile droplets that are connected by a microchannel, yet open to the atmosphere and hence free to evaporate. Our results reveal that fluid exchange between droplets occurs via a pumping flow driven by differences in hydrostatic and Laplace pressure between the two droplets. Evaporation causes the droplets to slowly lose volume and change shape, which subsequently affects the fluid transport between them. We observe that, for equal contact areas, a larger droplet typically feeds a smaller droplet during evaporation and the flow in the connecting channel is unidirectional. However, for unequal contact areas, the flow can reverse in the connecting channel following a sudden switch in dropletshape that occurs during evaporation. A stability,analysis reveals that the dynamics of the exchange flow are underpinned by a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Evaporative volume loss permits the droplet pair to step through a sequence of quasi-stationary states determined by the instantaneous volume of the system. Enforcing unequal contact area unfolds the bifurcation such that droplet-shape switching and the associated flow reversal can be understood in terms of a jump from the disconnected to the connected branch of the bifurcation. This establishes symmetry breaking as a mechanism to induce evaporation-driven flow reversal in connected droplets.</description>

      <title>Fast synthesis of turbulence with multi-scale coherent vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence synthesis methods often struggle to reproduce coherent vortices while capturing key statistical features. We introduce a fast synthetic turbulence method to generate instantaneous turbulent fields (termed `woven turbulence') with multi-scale vortices, combining the advantages of fractal models and coherent structures. The method generates multi-scale Burgers vortex tubes based on stochastic centerlines constructed by the fractional Brownian bridge. The largest and smallest vortices govern the integral and dissipation scales, respectively, enabling precise control over the energy spectrum across the energy-containing, inertial, and dissipation ranges. The adjustable vortex density allows tailored intermittency in velocity statistics. Remarkably, the woven turbulence achieves an extremely low computational cost, proportional to the total number of grid points. For the Taylor-Reynolds number larger than 200, its computational cost is over five orders of magnitude lower than that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Validation against DNS data demonstrates excellent agreement in energy spectra, velocity probability distributions, and intermittency scaling. Unlike prior methods, woven turbulence simultaneously reproduces Gaussian velocity distributions, Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling for the energy spectrum, as well as intertwined coherent vortices and intermittency akin to real turbulence. This approach not only bridges the gap between structural and statistical turbulence modelling, but also offers an efficient tool for applications requiring realistic turbulent fields.</description>

      <title>Stability of soluble surfactant-laden falling film over a hydrophobic incline in the presence of external shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic stability analysis of gravity-driven, soluble surfactant-laden fluid streaming down a slippery, slanted plane in the presence of external shear force is being explored in this article. The Navier-Stokes equations are considered for the fluid flow along with the appropriate advection-diffusion equations for the concentration of different surfactant species. The monomers considered here are anticipated to dissolve in the bulk flow and can be adsorbed at the interface of air-liquid as well. Also, the adsorption-desorption kinetics of the surfactants at the free space is taken into consideration. The motivation behind this work is to extend the work of Karapetsas and Bontozoglou[1] for flow over a slippery bottom and in the presence of externally imposed shear forces and observe their impact on the flow dynamics. The Orr-Sommerfeld eigensystem is obtained, then it is solved analytically using the longwave approximation method in the longwave regime ($k \ll 1$) and subsequently, the Chebyshev spectral collocation method is employed for numerical evaluation in the arbitrary wave regime. Using the analytical method, two longwave modes, viz, surface mode and surfactant mode, are detected. Alternatively, the numerical analysis substantiated the existence of temporal surface and surfactant modes. Moreover, another temporal mode named shear mode arises in the high modified Reynolds number region at a low inclination angle. Thereafter, the modified Reynolds-Orr energy equation is deduced under the normal mode conditions, and the behaviour of different energy components is investigated for various slip parameters and imposed shear force.</description>

      <title>Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive forces.The results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.</description>

      <title>Impact of internal flow and particle-substrate interaction on deposit patterns during evaporation of a colloidal sessile droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our numerical study aims to investigate particle deposit patterns from the evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet. An in house finite volume code is developed to simulate the coupled phenomena of flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change of the evaporating droplet. The numerical model takes into account evaporative cooling effect, surface tension gradient effect at the liquid-air interface, thermal buoyancy effect inside the droplet, thermosolutal buoyancy effect in the surrounding air and electrical double layer and Van der Waals interactions between substrate and colloidal particles. Three models are used in this study: (a) a model that takes into account only the strong evaporation near the pinned contact line (b) a model that takes into account in addition the thermo capillary effect and (c) a comprehensive model that takes into account all effects. The results show that without heating the thermal buoyancy has a negligible effect on the formation of particle deposit. In presence of substrate-particle interactions, dominant radial flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving a ring-like pattern with inner traces, while the Marangoni flow reduces the coffee ring effect giving a uniform deposit with a dark periphery</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously construct the first steady traveling wave solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation that take the form of a contiguous vortex-patch dipole, which can be viewed as the vortex-patch counterpart of the well-known Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. Our construction is based on a novel fixed-point approach that determines the patch boundary as the fixed point of a certain nonlinear map. Smoothness and other properties of the patch boundary are also obtained.</description>

      <title>AI-Accelerated Flow Simulation: A Robust Auto-Regressive Framework for Long-Term CFD Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.</description>
