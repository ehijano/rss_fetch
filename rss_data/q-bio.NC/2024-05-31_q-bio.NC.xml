      <title>Bifurcation enhances temporal information encoding in the olfactory periphery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems continually respond to signals from the surrounding environment. Survival requires that their responses adapt quickly and robustly to the changes in the environment. One particularly challenging example is olfactory navigation in turbulent plumes, where animals experience highly intermittent odor signals while odor concentration varies over many length- and timescales. Here, we show theoretically that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) can exploit proximity to a bifurcation point of their firing dynamics to reliably extract information about the timing and intensity of fluctuations in the odor signal, which have been shown to be critical for odor-guided navigation. Close to the bifurcation, the system is intrinsically invariant to signal variance, and information about the timing, duration, and intensity of odor fluctuations is transferred efficiently. Importantly, we find that proximity to the bifurcation is maintained by mean adaptation alone and therefore does not require any additional feedback mechanism or fine-tuning. Using a biophysical model with calcium-based feedback, we demonstrate that this mechanism can explain the measured adaptation characteristics of Drosophila ORNs.</description>

      <title>Using Contrastive Learning with Generative Similarity to Learn Spaces that Capture Human Inductive Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans rely on strong inductive biases to learn from few examples and abstract useful information from sensory data. Instilling such biases in machine learning models has been shown to improve their performance on various benchmarks including few-shot learning, robustness, and alignment. However, finding effective training procedures to achieve that goal can be challenging as psychologically-rich training data such as human similarity judgments are expensive to scale, and Bayesian models of human inductive biases are often intractable for complex, realistic domains. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a Bayesian notion of generative similarity whereby two datapoints are considered similar if they are likely to have been sampled from the same distribution. This measure can be applied to complex generative processes, including probabilistic programs. We show that generative similarity can be used to define a contrastive learning objective even when its exact form is intractable, enabling learning of spatial embeddings that express specific inductive biases. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing how it can be used to capture human inductive biases for geometric shapes, and to better distinguish different abstract drawing styles that are parameterized by probabilistic programs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Region Markovian Gaussian Process: An Efficient Method to Discover Directional Communications Across Multiple Brain Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the complex interactions between different brain regions is crucial in neuroscience. Various statistical methods have explored the latent communication across multiple brain regions. Two main categories are the Gaussian Process (GP) and Linear Dynamical System (LDS), each with unique strengths. The GP-based approach effectively discovers latent variables with frequency bands and communication directions. Conversely, the LDS-based approach is computationally efficient but lacks powerful expressiveness in latent representation. In this study, we merge both methodologies by creating an LDS mirroring a multi-output GP, termed Multi-Region Markovian Gaussian Process (MRM-GP). Our work establishes a connection between an LDS and a multi-output GP that explicitly models frequencies and phase delays within the latent space of neural recordings. Consequently, the model achieves a linear inference cost over time points and provides an interpretable low-dimensional representation, revealing communication directions across brain regions and separating oscillatory communications into different frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Motor Imagery Task Alters Dynamics of Human Body Posture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motor Imagery (MI) is gaining traction in both rehabilitation and sports settings, but its immediate influence on human postural control is not yet clearly understood. The focus of this study is to examine the effects of MI on the dynamics of the Center of Pressure (COP), a crucial metric for evaluating postural stability. In the experiment, thirty healthy young adults participated in four different scenarios: normal standing with both open and closed eyes, and kinesthetic motor imagery focused on mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) sway movements. A mathematical model was developed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the COP and to assess the impact of MI on these dynamics. Our results show a statistically significant increase (p-value&lt;0.05) in variables such as COP path length and Long-Range Correlation (LRC) during MI compared to the closed-eye and normal standing conditions. These observations align well with psycho-neuromuscular theory, which suggests that imagining a specific movement activates neural pathways, consequently affecting postural control. This study presents compelling evidence that motor imagery not only has a quantifiable impact on COP dynamics but also that changes in the Center of Pressure (COP) are directionally consistent with the imagined movements. This finding holds significant implications for the field of rehabilitation science, suggesting that motor imagery could be strategically utilized to induce targeted postural adjustments. Nonetheless, additional research is required to fully understand the complex mechanisms that underlie this relationship and to corroborate these results across a more diverse set of populations.</description>
