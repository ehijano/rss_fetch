      <title>Several sufficient conditions for projective hypersurfaces to be GIT (semi)stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I present some sufficient conditions for projective hypersurfaces to be GIT (semi-)stable. These conditions will be presented in terms of dimension and degree of the hypersurfaces, dimension of the singular locus and multiplicities of the singular points. When singularities of the hypersurface are isolated and all have multiplicity 2, we can judge its stability via the ranks of Hessian matrices at these singular points.</description>

      <title>Fibering out Calabi-Yau motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the modularity of mixed periods associated with singular fibers of specific families of Calabi-Yau threefolds. This is done by "fibering out", i.e. by expressing these periods as integrals of periods of families of K3 surfaces and by using modularity properties of the latter. Besides classical periods of holomorphic modular forms and meromorphic modular forms with vanishing residues, the computations lead to new interesting periods associated with meromorphic modular forms with non-vanishing residues as well as contours between CM points.</description>

      <title>On minimal 3-folds with $K^3\geq 86$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $5$-canonical map of every minimal projective $3$-fold $X$ with $K_X^3\geq 86$ is stably birational onto its image, which loosens previous requirements $K_X^3&gt;4355^3$ and $K_X^3&gt;12^3$ respectively given by Todorov and Chen. The essential technical ingredient of this paper is an efficient utilization of a moving divisor which grows from global $2$-forms by virtue of Chen-Jiang.</description>

      <title>Whitney equisingularity for families of hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish conditions for a family $\{f_t\}$ of functions, with not necessarily isolated singularities, defined on a toric variety so that the associated family of hypersurfaces $\{f_t^{-1}(0)\}$ is Whitney equisingular. We work in the setting of toric varieties with arbitrary singular sets. This extends previous results by Eyral and Oka concerning families $\{F_t\}$ of functions in $\mathbb{C}^n$, with not necessarily isolated singularities, ensuring that the corresponding hypersurface family $\{F_t^{-1}(0)\}$ is Whitney equisingular.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Enumerative Geometry: A Narrative from Classical Problems to Enriched Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enumerative geometry, the art and science of counting geometric objects satisfying geometric conditions, has seen a resurgence of activity in recent years due to an influx of new techniques that allow for enriched computations. This paper offers a historical survey of enumerative geometry, starting with its classical origins and real counterparts, to new advances in quadratic enrichment. We include a brief survey of the paradigm shift initiated by Gromov-Witten theory, whose impact can be seen in recent results in quadratically enriched enumerative geometry. Finally, we conclude with a brief overview of emerging directions including random and equivariant enumerative geometry.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraicity of non-abundant foliations and abundance for adjoint foliated structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the abundance conjecture in dimension $d$, we establish a non-algebraicity criterion of foliations: any log canonical foliation of rank $\le d$ with $\nu\neq\kappa$ is not algebraically integrable, answering question of Ambro--Cascini--Shokurov--Spicer. Under the same hypothesis, we prove abundance for klt algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures of dimension $\le d$ and show the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. In particular, when $d=3$, all these results hold unconditionally.
  Using similar arguments, we solve a problem proposed by Lu and Wang on abundance of surface adjoint foliated structures that are not necessarily algebraically integrable.</description>

      <title>A Syzygy Rank Characterization of Strongly Euler Homogeneity for Projective Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a characterization of strongly Euler homogeneous singular points on a reduced complex projective hypersurface $D=V(f)\subset \PP^n$ using the Jacobian syzygies of $f$. The characterization compares the ranks of the first syzygy matrices of the global Jacobian ideal $J_f$ and its quotient $J_f/(f)$. When $D$ has only isolated singularities, our characterization refines a recent result of Andrade-Beorchia-Dimca-Mir\'{o}-Roig. We also prove a generalization of this characterization to smooth projective toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic jets and the chiral de Rham complex of a pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a smooth variety $X$ with simple normal crossings divisor $D$, we associate a sheaf of vertex algebras on $X$, denoted $\Omega^{ch}_{X}(\operatorname{log}D)$, whose conformal weight $0$ subspace is the algebra $\Omega_{X}(\operatorname{log}D)$ of forms with log poles along $D$. We prove various basic structural results about $\Omega^{ch}_{X}(\operatorname{log}D)$. In particular, if $X^{*}=X\setminus D$ has a volume form then we show that $\Omega^{ch}_{X}(\operatorname{log}D)$ admits a topological structure of rank $d=\operatorname{dim}(X)$, which is enhanced to an extended topological structure if $D\sim -K_{X}$ is in fact anticanonical. In this latter case we also show that the resulting $(q,y)$ character $\operatorname{Ell}(X,D)(q,y)$ is a section of the line bundle $\Theta^{\otimes d}$ on the elliptic curve $E=\mathbf{C}^{*}/q^{\mathbf{Z}}$. We further show how $\Omega^{ch}_{X}(\operatorname{log}D)$ can be understood in terms of a simple birational modification of the space of jets into $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Hodge-Riemann pair of cohomology classes that generalizes the classical Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, and the notion of a Bogomolov pair of cohomology classes that generalizes the Bogomolov inequality for semistable sheaves. We conjecture that every Hodge-Riemann pair is a Bogomolov pair, and prove various cases of this conjecture. As an application we get new results concerning boundedness of semistable sheaves.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten theory, degenerations, and the tautological ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gromov-Witten (GW) theory produces Chow and cohomology classes on the moduli of curves, and there are several conjectures/speculations about their relation to the tautological ring. We develop new degeneration techniques to address these.
  In Chow, we show that GW cycles of complete intersections in products of projective spaces (and more generally a broad class of toric varieties) with restricted insertions are tautological. This gives significant evidence for a 2010 speculation of Pandharipande that GW cycles of varieties over the algebraic numbers are tautological. In particular, the 0-cycle for curves on the quintic threefold is proportional to a zero stratum in the moduli space of stable curves.
  In cohomology, we show that in normal crossings degenerations, GW classes of the general fiber lie in the span of absolute GW classes of the special fiber strata. This confirms a 2006 conjecture of Levine-Pandharipande for targets that degenerate into elementary pieces, including complete intersections in products of projective spaces and many toric varieties.
  Our proofs rely on several reconstruction theorems in logarithmic GW theory, which make the logarithmic degeneration formula an inductive tool to compute GW cycles via snc degenerations. We prove a folklore conjecture that logarithmic GW cycles of a pair are determined by absolute invariants of the strata. We prove a conjecture of Urundolil Kumaran and the second author that GW cycles of toric pairs are tautological, and analogous results for broken toric bundles. We also develop tools to study GW cycles with vanishing cohomology and strengthen the logarithmic degeneration formula to allow iteration.</description>

      <title>$q$-Hodge complexes over the Habiro ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peter Scholze has raised the question whether some variant of the $q$-de Rham complex is already defined over the Habiro ring $\mathcal H = \lim_{m\in\mathbb N}\mathbb Z[q]_{(q^m-1)}^\wedge$. We show that such a variant exists whenever the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a "$q$-Hodge filtration": a $q$-deformation of the Hodge filtration, subject to some reasonable conditions. To any such $q$-Hodge filtration we associate a small modification of the $q$-de Rham complex, which we call the $q$-Hodge complex, and show that it descends canonically to the Habiro ring. This construction recovers and generalises the Habiro ring of a number field of Garoufalidis-Scholze-Wheeler-Zagier and is closely related to the $q$-de Rham--Witt complexes from previous work of the author as well as, conjecturally, to Scholze's analytic Habiro stack.
  While there's no canonical $q$-Hodge filtration in general, we show that it does exist in many cases of interest. For example, for a smooth scheme $X$ over $\mathbb Z$, the $q$-de Rham complex can be equipped with a canonical $q$-Hodge filtration as soon as one inverts all primes $p\leq \dim(X/\mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of weighted projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective toric variety of dimension $n$ and let $L$ be a ample line bundle on $X$. For $k \geq 0$, it is in general difficult to determine whether $L^{\otimes k}$ is very ample and whether it additionally gives a projectively normal embedding. These two properties are equivalent to the very ampleness, respectively normality, of the corresponding polytope. By a result of Ewald-Wessels, both statements are classically known to hold for $k \geq n - 1$.
  We study embeddings of weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{P}(a_0, \ldots, a_n)$ via their corresponding rectangular simplices $\Delta(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)$. We give multiple criteria (depending on arithmetic properties of the weights $a_i$) to obtain bounds for the power $k$ which are sharp in many cases. We also introduce combinatorial tools that allow us to systematically construct families exhibiting extremal behaviour. These results extend earlier work of Payne, Hering and Bruns-Gubeladze.</description>

      <title>On Milnor $K$-theory in the imperfect residue case and applications to period-index problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called pseudo-perfect extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$. This bound is sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Aspects of Elliptic Schubert Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to extend two fundamental combinatorial results in Schubert calculus on flag manifolds from equivariant cohomology and $K$-theory to equivariant elliptic cohomology. The foundations of elliptic Schubert calculus were laid in a few relatively recent papers by Rim\'anyi, Weber, and Kumar. They include the recursive construction of elliptic Schubert classes via generalizations of the cohomology and $K$-theory push-pull operators and the study of the corresponding Demazure algebra. We derive a Billey-type formula for the localization of elliptic Schubert classes (for partial flag manifolds of arbitrary type) and a pipe dream model for their polynomial representatives in the case of type $A$ flag manifolds. The latter extends the pipe dream model for double Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. We also study the degeneration of elliptic Schubert classes to $K$-theory, which recovers the corresponding classical formulas.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the strongly robust complex for configurations in general position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly robust toric ideals are the toric ideals for which the set of indispensable binomials is the Graver basis. The strongly robust simplicial complex $\Delta _T$ of a simple toric ideal $I_T$ determines the strongly robust property for all toric ideals that have $I_T$ as their bouquet ideal. We prove that $\text{dim} \Delta_T&lt;\text{rank}(T)$ for configurations in general position, partially answering a question posed by Sullivant.</description>

      <title>The relative minimal model program for excellent algebraic spaces and analytic spaces in equal characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the relative minimal model program with scaling for locally projective morphisms of quasi-excellent algebraic spaces admitting dualizing complexes, quasi-excellent formal schemes admitting dualizing complexes, semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field, all in equal characteristic zero. To do so, we prove finite generation of relative adjoint rings associated to projective morphisms of such spaces using the strategy of Cascini and Lazi\'c and the generalization of the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem to the scheme setting recently established by the second author. To prove these results uniformly, we prove GAGA theorems for Grothendieck duality and dualizing complexes to reduce to the algebraic case. In addition, we apply our methods to establish the relative minimal model program with scaling for spaces of the form above in dimensions $\le 3$ in positive and mixed characteristic, and to show that one can run the relative minimal model program with scaling for complex analytic spaces without shrinking the base at each step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate singularities on fibrations and related topics. We prove conjectures of McKernan and Shokurov on singularities on Fano type fibrations and a conjecture of the author on singularities on log Calabi-Yau fibrations. From these we derive a variant of a conjecture of McKernan and Prokhorov on rationally connected varieties with nef anti-canonical divisor.
  We present further applications to other problems including boundedness of klt complements for Fano fibrations over curves, torsion index of rationally connected Calabi-Yau pairs, and gonality of fibres of del Pezzo fibrations.
  We prove a general result on controlling multiplicities of fibres of certain fibrations (not necessarily of Fano type) which is the key ingredient of the proofs of the above results.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ associated with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations of relative Picard number $1$. The construction is modelled on the fact that the affine cone over the Segre-embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is the null locus of the $\sharp$-map of the $9$-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Using three fixed complementary primitive idempotents and the Peirce decomposition, we coordinatize $J$ by $8$ parameters and thereby obtain $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$.
  We then produce complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds, anticanonically embedded of codimension $4$, as weighted complete intersections in suitable weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$, in its subvarieties, or in their weighted cones (allowing some coordinates of weight $0$). We refer to $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and these projectivizations as key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds.
  As an application, we show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-fold of genus $3$ with three $1/2(1,1,1)$-singularities of type No.,5.4 as in \cite{Tak1} arises as a linear section of a weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with all coordinates of positive weight, and conversely any such threefold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ to the $C_{2}$-cluster variety of Coughlan--Ducat \cite{CD1}, we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or of its subvarieties serve as key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds belonging to $108$ classes in the online database \cite{GRDB}.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a notion of tensor product of (twisted) quiver representations with relations in the category of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: This work is dedicated to studying holomorphic distributions on Grassmann manifolds and smooth quadric hypersurfaces. In special, we prove, under certain conditions, when the tangent and conormal sheaves of a distribution splits as a sum of line bundles on these manifolds, generalizing the previous works on Fano threefolds and $\mathbb{P}^{n}$. We analyze how the algebro-geometric properties of the singular set of singular holomorphic distributions relate to their associated sheaves.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Varieties in Second Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic geometric framework for Fock space coupled cluster theory in second quantization. In quantum chemistry, many-electron states are represented as elements of the exterior algebra. The fermionic creation and annihilation operators generate the Fermi-Dirac algebra, which can be realized as a Clifford algebra acting on the exterior algebra. We present a non-commutative Gr\"obner basis for the Fermi-Dirac algebra; offering an alternative proof of Wick's theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory. In coupled cluster theory, eigenpairs of the Schr\"odinger equation are approximated by a hierarchy of polynomial equations corresponding to different levels of truncation. The coupled cluster exponential parameterization of quantum states gives rise to Fock space truncation varieties. This reveals well-known varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag varieties and spinor varieties. We offer a detailed study of the truncation varieties, providing an explicit description of their defining equations and dimension. Furthermore, we classify all cases in which their coupled cluster degree coincides with the degree of the graph of the exponential parameterization - most notably for singleton truncations such as CCD and for the Schubert like truncation varieties such as the Grassmannian, flag variety and the spinor variety.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen Bundles of Quintic Covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth irreducible curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. We classify the bundles that arise this way when $d = 5$. Equivalently, we classify which $\mathbb{P}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain smooth irreducible degree $5$ covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$.
  Our main contribution is proving the existence of \emph{smooth} covers whose structure sheaf has the desired pushforward. We do this by showing that the substack of singular curves has positive codimension in the moduli stack of finite flat covers with desired pushforward. To compute the dimension of the space of singular curves, we prove a (relative) ``minimization theorem'', which is the geometric analogue of Bhargava's sieving argument when computing the densities of discriminants of quintic number fields.</description>

As an application, we obtain a similar normality criterion for local models in both equal and mixed characteristic. In particular, we give a classification of normal Pappas-Zhu local models at absolutely special level as well as for adjoint groups of rank 1.</description>

Abstract: Considering the so-called Simpson system on smooth projective varieties, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, whose canonical bundle is ample, I give another proof the stability of this Higgs bundle, from which follows another proof of the Guggenheimer-Yau inequality. Where the equality holds, I prove that the discriminant class of the Simpson system vanishes and this Higgs bundle is curve semistable. This result follows from the study of the relations between ampleness and numerically nefness for Higgs bundles which "feel" the Higgs field and (semi)stability. Moreover, I obtain another proof of algebraic hyperbolicity of these varieties which furnishes a lower bound on a real positive constant related to this property; to best of my knowledge, this is the first and unique result of this type.</description>

      <title>Quadrature rules with few nodes supported on algebraic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quadrature rules for measures supported on real algebraic and rational curves, focusing on the {odd-degree} case \(2s-1\). Adopting an optimization viewpoint, we minimize suitable penalty functions over the space of quadrature rules of strength \(2s-1\), so that optimal solutions yield rules with the minimal number of nodes. For plane algebraic curves of degree \(d\), we derive explicit node bounds depending on \(d\) and the number of places at infinity, improving results of Riener--Schweighofer, and Zalar. For rational curves in arbitrary dimension of degree \(d\), we further refine these bounds using the geometry of the parametrization and recover the classical Gaussian quadrature bound when \(d=1\). Our results reveal a direct link between the algebraic complexity of the supporting curve and the minimal size of quadrature formulas, providing a unified framework that connects real algebraic geometry, polynomial optimization, and moment theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note revisits stability conditions on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on irreducible projective curves. In particular, all stability conditions on smooth curves are classified and a connected component of the stability manifold containing all the geometric stability conditions is identified for singular curves. On smooth curves of positive genus, the set of all non-locally-finite stability conditions gives a partial boundary of any known compactification of the stability manifold. To provide a reasonable full boundary, a notion of regular weak stability condition is proposed based on the definition of Collins--Lo--Shi--Yau and is classified for smooth curves of positive genus. On non-rational singular curves, any locally-finite numerical stability condition is shown to be geometric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a top gamma vector component equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is known (and expected more generally) that the cases where this top component is 0 are among the "building blocks" of those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood. In the course of addressing this situation, we find that this interpretation encodes *intrinsic* combinatorial information on the fan in addition to earlier compatibility with existing natural combinatorial examples.
  Our main method uses wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these "anchoring" linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them which are connected to optimization. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles covering the minimal objects described above. We intersect rational equivalence relations with 2-dimensional orbit closures instead of 1-dimensional ones as in most combinatorial applications.</description>

      <title>Smooth hyperbolicity cones are second-order cone representable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Netzer and Sanyal proved that every smooth hyperbolicity cone is a spectrahedral shadow. We generalize and sharpen this result at the same time, by showing that every Nash-smooth hyperbolicity cone is even second-order cone representable (socr). The result is proved as a consequence of our second theorem, according to which every compact convex semialgebraic set with Nash-smooth boundary of strict positive curvature is socr. The proof uses the technique of tensor evaluation.</description>

      <title>Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for calculating $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation--theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Conifold gap and all-genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.</description>

      <title>Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
  Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu. We also give a purely geometric proof of the required cohomological bound.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kuznetsov component of cubic fivefolds via their quadric fibration model. We construct a family of Serre-invariant Bridgeland stability conditions on the Kuznetsov component and establish the non-emptiness of all moduli spaces of stable objects. As an application, we identify the lowest-dimensional moduli with the Fano surface of planes of the cubic fivefold, and recover a classical result of its Lagrangian immersion into a hyper-K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0810.5176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let N be a positive integer and let f be a newform of weight 2 on \Gamma_0(N). In earlier joint work with K. Ribet and W. Stein, we introduced the notions of the modular number and the congruence number of the quotient abelian variety A_f of J_0(N) associated to the newform f. These invariants are analogs of the notions of the modular degree and congruence primes respectively associated to elliptic curves. We show that if p is a prime such that every maximal ideal of the Hecke algebra of characteristic p that contains the annihilator ideal of f satisfies multiplicity one, then the modular number and the congruence number have the same p-adic valuation.</description>

      <title>On the Hasse Principle for conic bundles over even degree extensions</title>

Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field and let $\pi \colon X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^1$ be a smooth conic bundle. We show that if $X/k$ has four geometric singular fibers with $X(\mathbb{A}_k)\neq \emptyset$ or non-trivial Brauer group, then $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over any even degree extension $L/k$. Furthermore for arbitrary $X$ we show that, conditional on Schinzel's hypothesis, $X$ satisfies the Hasse principle over all but finitely many quadratic extensions of $k$. We prove these results by showing the Brauer-Manin obstruction vanishes and then apply fibration method results of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene, following Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc.</description>

      <title>Boundary local integrability of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by studying boundary singularities of rational functions in two variables that are analytic on a domain, we investigate local integrability on $\mathbb{R}^2$ near $(0,0)$ of rational functions with denominator non-vanishing in the bi-upper half-plane but with an isolated zero (with respect to $\mathbb{R}^2$) at the origin. Building on work of Bickel-Pascoe-Sola, we give a necessary and sufficient test for membership in a local $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ space and we give a complete description of all numerators $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally in a given $L^{p}$ space. As applications, we prove that every bounded rational function on the bidisk has partial derivatives belonging to $L^1$ on the two-torus. In addition, we give a new proof of a conjecture, started in Bickel-Knese-Pascoe-Sola and completed by Koll\'ar, characterizing the ideal of $Q$ such that $Q/P$ is locally bounded. A larger takeaway from this work is that a local model for stable polynomials we employ is a flexible tool and may be of use for other local questions about stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Realization of Spherical T-Duality via $\star$-Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between two distinct frameworks for constructing and relating smooth manifolds: the geometric theory of \emph{$\star$-diagrams} and the string-theory-inspired notion of \emph{spherical T-duality}. We prove that for linear $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over the 4-sphere, the existence of a $\star$-diagram connecting two such bundles is equivalent to them forming a spherical T-dual pair. This result provides a concrete geometric realization of spherical T-duality, interpreting its abstract cohomological definitions in the language of differential geometry.
  To forge this connection, we introduce a higher-dimensional generalization of \emph{logarithmic transformations}. These topological surgeries change the diffeomorphism type of the homology $\Sigma\times \mathrm{S}^1$, where $\Sigma$ is a homotopy sphere. Forgetting the $\mathrm{S}^1$-factor, they realize the constructed spherical T-dualities. Furthermore, we show that the known isomorphisms in the equivariant K-theory and cohomology between the T-dual manifolds are a direct consequence of an underlying \emph{Morita equivalence} between the action groupoids naturally associated with the base manifolds in a $\star$-diagram.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we'll introduce a $q$-variant of Witt vectors and de Rham-Witt complexes. This variant is closely related to the Habiro ring of a number field constructed by Garoufalidis, Scholze, Wheeler, and Zagier, to $q$-Hodge cohomology, and to $\operatorname{THH}(-/\mathrm{ku})$. While most of these connections will only be explored in forthcoming work, the goal of this article is to provide the necessary technical foundation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the theory of parity sheaves, which allows for non-locally constant sheaves along strata. Our definition is tailored for proving the existence of (proper, quasihereditary, etc) stratifications of $\mathrm{Ext}$-algebras. We use this to study quiver Schur algebras $A(\alpha)$ for the cyclic quiver of length $2$. We find a polynomial quasihereditary structure on $A(\alpha)$ compatible with the categorified PBW basis of McNamara and Kleshchev-Muth, and sharpen their results to arbitrary characteristic. We also prove that semicuspidal algebras of $A(n\delta)$ are polynomial quasihereditary covers of semicuspidal algebras of the corresponding KLR algebra $R(n\delta)$, and compute them diagrammatically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, their properties, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class appears in algebraic geometry, differential geometry, algebra, and in Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. In particular, we use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category.</description>

      <title>Computing the number of realisations of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is said to be rigid if, given a generic realisation of the graph as a bar-and-joint framework in the plane, there exist only finitely many other realisations of the graph with the same edge lengths modulo rotations, reflections and translations. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in determining exactly what this finite amount is, hereon known as the realisation number. Combinatorial algorithms for the realisation number were previously known for the special cases of minimally rigid and redundantly rigid graphs. In this paper we provide a combinatorial algorithm to compute the realisation number of any rigid graph, and thus solve an open problem of Jackson and Owen. We then adapt our algorithm to compute: (i) spherical realisation numbers, and (ii) the number of rank-3 PSD matrix completions of a generic partial matrix.</description>
