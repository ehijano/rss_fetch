      <title>Towards Interpretable Protein Structure Prediction with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models have revolutionized structure prediction, but their nonlinear nature obscures how sequence representations inform structure prediction. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a path to interpretability here by learning linear representations in high-dimensional space, their application has been limited to smaller protein language models unable to perform structure prediction. In this work, we make two key advances: (1) we scale SAEs to ESM2-3B, the base model for ESMFold, enabling mechanistic interpretability of protein structure prediction for the first time, and (2) we adapt Matryoshka SAEs for protein language models, which learn hierarchically organized features by forcing nested groups of latents to reconstruct inputs independently. We demonstrate that our Matryoshka SAEs achieve comparable or better performance than standard architectures. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that SAEs trained on ESM2-3B significantly outperform those trained on smaller models for both biological concept discovery and contact map prediction. Finally, we present an initial case study demonstrating how our approach enables targeted steering of ESMFold predictions, increasing structure solvent accessibility while fixing the input sequence. To facilitate further investigation by the broader community, we open-source our code, dataset, pretrained models https://github.com/johnyang101/reticular-sae , and visualizer https://sae.reticular.ai .</description>

      <title>Differentiable Folding for Nearest Neighbor Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nearest Neighbor model is the $\textit{de facto}$ thermodynamic model of RNA secondary structure formation and is a cornerstone of RNA structure prediction and sequence design. The current functional form (Turner 2004) contains $\approx13,000$ underlying thermodynamic parameters, and fitting these to both experimental and structural data is computationally challenging. Here, we leverage recent advances in $\textit{differentiable folding}$, a method for directly computing gradients of the RNA folding algorithms, to devise an efficient, scalable, and flexible means of parameter optimization that uses known RNA structures and thermodynamic experiments. Our method yields a significantly improved parameter set that outperforms existing baselines on all metrics, including an increase in the average predicted probability of ground-truth sequence-structure pairs for a single RNA family by over 23 orders of magnitude. Our framework provides a path towards drastically improved RNA models, enabling the flexible incorporation of new experimental data, definition of novel loss terms, large training sets, and even treatment as a module in larger deep learning pipelines. We make available a new database, RNAometer, with experimentally-determined stabilities for small RNA model systems.</description>

      <title>GENEOnet: Statistical analysis supporting explainability and trustworthiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as mathematical tools for constructing networks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recent findings suggest that such models can be inserted within the domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) due to their inherent interpretability. In this study, we aim to verify this claim with respect to GENEOnet, a GENEO network developed for an application in computational biochemistry by employing various statistical analyses and experiments. Such experiments first allow us to perform a sensitivity analysis on GENEOnet's parameters to test their significance. Subsequently, we show that GENEOnet exhibits a significantly higher proportion of equivariance compared to other methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that GENEOnet is on average robust to perturbations arising from molecular dynamics. These results collectively serve as proof of the explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness of GENEOnet and confirm the beneficial use of GENEOs in the context of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.</description>

      <title>ProtTeX: Structure-In-Context Reasoning and Editing of Proteins with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have made remarkable progress in the field of molecular science, particularly in understanding and generating functional small molecules. This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</description>
