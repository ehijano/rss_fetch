      <title>Realizing Scaling Laws in Recommender Systems: A Foundation-Expert Paradigm for Hyperscale Model Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong, cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight, surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead. To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving, logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven, compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of scaling laws in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-based IR-system for Bank Supervisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of 0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.</description>

      <title>SustainableQA: A Comprehensive Question Answering Dataset for Corporate Sustainability and EU Taxonomy Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for corporate sustainability transparency, particularly under new regulations like the EU Taxonomy, necessitates precise data extraction from large, unstructured corporate reports. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, requires high-quality, domain-specific question-answering (QA) datasets to excel at particular domains. To address this, we introduce SustainableQA, a novel dataset and a scalable pipeline for generating a comprehensive QA datasets from corporate sustainability reports and annual reports. Our approach integrates semantic chunk classification, a hybrid span extraction pipeline combining fine-tuned Named Entity Recognition (NER), rule-based methods, and LLM-driven refinement, alongside a specialized table-to-paragraph transformation. With over 195,000 diverse factoid and non-factoid QA pairs, SustainableQA is an effective resource for developing and benchmarking advanced knowledge assistants capable of navigating complex sustainability compliance</description>

      <title>KBest: Efficient Vector Search on Kunpeng CPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector search, which returns the vectors most similar to a given query vector from a large vector dataset, underlies many important applications such as search, recommendation, and LLMs. To be economic, vector search needs to be efficient to reduce the resources required by a given query workload. However, existing vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss and DiskANN) are optimized for x86 CPU architectures (i.e., Intel and AMD CPUs) while Huawei Kunpeng CPUs are based on the ARM architecture and competitive in compute power. In this paper, we present KBest as a vector search library tailored for the latest Kunpeng 920 CPUs. To be efficient, KBest incorporates extensive hardware-aware and algorithmic optimizations, which include single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) accelerated distance computation, data prefetch, index refinement, early termination, and vector quantization. Experiment results show that KBest outperforms SOTA vector search libraries running on x86 CPUs, and our optimizations can improve the query throughput by over 2x. Currently, KBest serves applications from both our internal business and external enterprise clients with tens of millions of queries on a daily basis.</description>

      <title>ADSeeker: A Knowledge-Infused Framework for Anomaly Detection and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic vision inspection holds significant importance in industry inspection. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning. To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base, SEEK-MVTec&amp;VisA (SEEK-M&amp;V), which we construct to address the limitations of existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&amp;V includes semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection (IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly (MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories. Extensive experiments show that our plug-and-play framework, ADSeeker, achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Dual-disentangle Framework for Diversified Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts user preferences over time and has achieved remarkable success. However, the growing length of user interaction sequences and the complex entanglement of evolving user interests and intentions introduce significant challenges to diversity. To address these, we propose a model-agnostic Dual-disentangle framework for Diversified Sequential Recommendation (DDSRec). The framework refines user interest and intention modeling by adopting disentangling perspectives in interaction modeling and representation learning, thereby balancing accuracy and diversity in sequential recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DDSRec in terms of accuracy and diversity for sequential recommendations.</description>

      <title>Reliable Evaluation Protocol for Low-Precision Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Single Collaborative Branch for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores. In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and extended for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MultiRAG: A Knowledge-guided Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-source Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.</description>

      <title>PyLate: Flexible Training and Retrieval for Late Interaction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval. While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain, long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts, primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training, advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models, thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility for both research and production environments.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Sequential Recommendations: Counterfactual Explanations via Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in capturing users' evolving preferences. However, their inherent complexity as "black box" models poses significant challenges for explainability. This work presents the first counterfactual explanation technique specifically developed for SRSs, introducing a novel approach in this space, addressing the key question: What minimal changes in a user's interaction history would lead to different recommendations? To achieve this, we introduce a specialized genetic algorithm tailored for discrete sequences and show that generating counterfactual explanations for sequential data is an NP-Complete problem. We evaluate these approaches across four experimental settings, varying between targeted-untargeted and categorized-uncategorized scenarios, to comprehensively assess their capability in generating meaningful explanations. Using three different datasets and three models, we are able to demonstrate that our methods successfully generate interpretable counterfactual explanation while maintaining model fidelity close to one. Our findings contribute to the growing field of Explainable AI by providing a framework for understanding sequential recommendation decisions through the lens of "what-if" scenarios, ultimately enhancing user trust and system transparency.</description>

      <title>LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations at eBay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.</description>

      <title>Personalized Recommendation of Dish and Restaurant Collections on iFood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly created collections, we develop content-based representations using item embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably, our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance, enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food collections in a dynamic commercial environment.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Knowledge Poisoning Attacks During Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source. Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to those of the original RAG systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent System for Complex Reasoning in Radiology Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA, they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding, multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex reasoning.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Cognitive Response of Brake Lights in Initiating Braking Action Using EEG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half of all road accidents result from either lack of driver attention or from maintaining insufficient separation between vehicles. Collision from the rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years. Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the EEG signal.</description>

      <title>Taggus: An Automated Pipeline for the Extraction of Characters' Social Networks from Portuguese Fiction Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically identifying characters and their interactions from fiction books is, arguably, a complex task that requires pipelines that leverage multiple Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-speech (POS) tagging. However, these methods are not optimized for the task that leads to the construction of Social Networks of Characters. Indeed, the currently available methods tend to underperform, especially in less-represented languages, due to a lack of manually annotated data for training. Here, we propose a pipeline, which we call Taggus, to extract social networks from literary fiction works in Portuguese. Our results show that compared to readily available State-of-the-Art tools -- off-the-shelf NER tools and Large Language Models (ChatGPT) -- the resulting pipeline, which uses POS tagging and a combination of heuristics, achieves satisfying results with an average F1-Score of $94.1\%$ in the task of identifying characters and solving for co-reference and $75.9\%$ in interaction detection. These represent, respectively, an increase of $50.7\%$ and $22.3\%$ on results achieved by the readily available State-of-the-Art tools. Further steps to improve results are outlined, such as solutions for detecting relationships between characters. Limitations on the size and scope of our testing samples are acknowledged. The Taggus pipeline is publicly available to encourage development in this field for the Portuguese language.2</description>

Abstract: SemEval-2025 Task 7: Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval is approached as a Learning-to-Rank task using a bi-encoder model fine-tuned from a pre-trained transformer optimized for sentence similarity. Training used both the source languages and their English translations for multilingual retrieval and only English translations for cross-lingual retrieval. Using lightweight models with fewer than 500M parameters and training on Kaggle T4 GPUs, the method achieved 92% Success@10 in multilingual and 80% Success@10 in 5th in crosslingual and 10th in multilingual tracks.</description>

      <title>OpenLifelogQA: An Open-Ended Multi-Modal Lifelog Question-Answering Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&amp;A with diverse types and difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665 LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&amp;A dataset to the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a reality.</description>

      <title>Are We on the Right Way for Assessing Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.</description>

      <title>Heterophily-Aware Fair Recommendation using Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to improve the accuracy and performance of recommender systems. Modern recommender systems are not only designed to serve end users, but also to benefit other participants, such as items and item providers. These participants may have different or conflicting goals and interests, which raises the need for fairness and popularity bias considerations. GNN-based recommendation methods also face the challenges of unfairness and popularity bias, and their normalization and aggregation processes suffer from these challenges. In this paper, we propose a fair GNN-based recommender system, called HetroFair, to improve item-side fairness. HetroFair uses two separate components to generate fairness-aware embeddings: i) Fairness-aware attention, which incorporates the dot product in the normalization process of GNNs to decrease the effect of nodes' degrees. ii) Heterophily feature weighting, to assign distinct weights to different features during the aggregation process. To evaluate the effectiveness of HetroFair, we conduct extensive experiments over six real-world datasets. Our experimental results reveal that HetroFair not only alleviates unfairness and popularity bias on the item side but also achieves superior accuracy on the user side. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/NematGH/HetroFair.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Aspect Item Palette: A Semantic Tokenization Framework for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation models often rely on unique item identifiers (IDs) to distinguish between items, which can hinder their ability to effectively leverage item content information and generalize to long-tailed or cold-start items. Recently, semantic tokenization has been proposed as a promising solution that aims to tokenize each item's semantic representation into a sequence of discrete tokens. These semantic tokens have become fundamental in training generative recommendation models. However, existing methods typically rely on RQ-VAE, a residual vector quantizer, for semantic tokenization. This reliance introduces several key limitations, including challenges in embedding extraction, hierarchical coarse-to-fine quantization, and training stability. To address these issues, we introduce LAMIA, a novel approach for multi-aspect semantic tokenization. Unlike RQ-VAE, which uses a single embedding, LAMIA learns an ``item palette''--a collection of independent and semantically parallel embeddings that capture multiple aspects of items. Additionally, LAMIA enhances the semantic encoders through domain-specific tuning using text-based reconstruction tasks, resulting in more representative item palette embeddings. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the LAMIA framework across various recommendation tasks and datasets. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy over existing methods. To facilitate reproducible research, we will release the source code, data, and configurations.</description>

      <title>LightRetriever: A LLM-based Hybrid Retrieval Architecture with 1000x Faster Query Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based text retrieval retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel LLM-based retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a full LLM on an A800 GPU, our method achieves over 1000x speedup in query encoding and over 10x increase in end-to-end retrieval throughput. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks show that LightRetriever generalizes well across diverse tasks, maintaining an average of 95% retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</description>

      <title>MetaGen Blended RAG: Unlocking Zero-Shot Precision for Specialized Domain Question-Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) struggles with domain-specific enterprise datasets, often isolated behind firewalls and rich in complex, specialized terminology unseen by LLMs during pre-training. Semantic variability across domains like medicine, networking, or law hampers RAG's context precision, while fine-tuning solutions are costly, slow, and lack generalization as new data emerges. Achieving zero-shot precision with retrievers without fine-tuning still remains a key challenge. We introduce 'MetaGen Blended RAG', a novel enterprise search approach that enhances semantic retrievers through a metadata generation pipeline and hybrid query indexes using dense and sparse vectors. By leveraging key concepts, topics, and acronyms, our method creates metadata-enriched semantic indexes and boosted hybrid queries, delivering robust, scalable performance without fine-tuning. On the biomedical PubMedQA dataset, MetaGen Blended RAG achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all prior zero-shot RAG benchmarks and even rivaling fine-tuned models on that dataset, while also excelling on datasets like SQuAD and NQ. This approach redefines enterprise search using a new approach to building semantic retrievers with unmatched generalization across specialized domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.</description>

      <title>Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

Grounded in the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) model, this paper proposes a foundational mapping for the abstract legal Work - which is materialized as the Norm node in our legal Graph RAG framework - to the interoperable schema.org/Legislation vocabulary. Using the Normas.leg.br portal as a practical case study, we demonstrate how to describe this Work entity via JSON-LD, considering stable URN identifiers, inter-norm relationships, and lifecycle properties. This structured, formal approach provides the essential first step toward creating a deterministic and verifiable knowledge graph, which can serve as a formalized "ground truth" for Legal AI applications, overcoming the limitations of purely probabilistic models.</description>
