      <title>Comments on the paper "Derivation of lump solutions to a variety of Boussinesq equations with distinct dimensions."</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Comments are devoted to the paper 'Derivation of lump solutions to a variety of Boussinesq equations with distinct dimensions' (Int J Numer Methods Heat Fluid Flow. 2022;32:3072{3082), in which three new generalizations of the classical Boussinesq equation are suggested that were further investigated in several papers. Here it is shown that the equations derived in the above paper are not presented in their canonical forms. It turns out that all three equations can be essentially simplified by the standard technique widely used for linear and quasi-linear PDEs. As a result, it is proved that the equations suggested are not multidimensional generalizations of the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>On complex algebraic singularities of some genuinely nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we highlight a new phenomenon of complex algebraic singularity formation for solutions of a large class of genuinely nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We start from a unique Cauchy datum, which is holomorphic ramified around the smooth locus and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian. Moreover, the singular locus S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers equation. Later, we state a general conjecture that describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state another Conjecture 2, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 2. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests that suggest that a Banach norm should exist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique. This work is a continuation of Leichtnam (1993).</description>

      <title>Integrable systems associated to the filtrations of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983 Bogoyavlenski conjectured that if the Euler equations on a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g_0$ are integrable, then their certain extensions to semisimple lie algebras $\mathfrak g$ related to the filtrations of Lie algebras $\mathfrak g_0\subset \mathfrak g_1\subset \mathfrak g_2\dots\subset\mathfrak g_{n-1}\subset \mathfrak g_n=\mathfrak g$ are integrable as well. In particular, by taking $\mathfrak g_0=\{0\}$ and natural filtrations of $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ and $\mathfrak{u}(n)$, we have Gel'fand-Cetlin integrable systems. We proved the conjecture for filtrations of compact Lie algebras $\mathfrak g$: the system are integrable in a noncommutative sense by means of polynomial integrals. Various constructions of complete commutative polynomial integrals for the system are also given.</description>

      <title>Algebraic curves as a source of separable multi-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we systematically consider various ways of generating integrable and separable Hamiltonian systems in canonical and in non-canonical representations from algebraic curves on the plane. In particular, we consider St\"ackel transform between two pairs of St\"ackel systems, generated by 2n-parameter algebraic curves on the plane, as well as Miura maps between St\"ackel systems generated by (n+N)-parameter algebraic curves, leading to multi-Hamiltonian representation of these systems.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions and breakdown of manifolds determined by Cauchy problems of the Degasperis-Procesi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that both local and non-local formulations of the Degasperis-Procesi equation possess a pseudospherical nature. As a result, solutions determined by Cauchy problems with non-trivial initial data and a minimal specific regularity define an orthonormal coframe for a pseudospherical metric within a designated strip. While the region is entirely described by the initial condition, the one-forms are determined by the corresponding solutions. Moreover, we establish that any non-trivial initial condition yields a second fundamental form, which is locally determined within the strip. The surface may collapse within a finite-height strip when the initial condition leads to wave breaking. We determine conditions for the coframe to be defined on the upper plane. We investigate possible integrability structures related to the triad of fundamental one-forms.</description>
