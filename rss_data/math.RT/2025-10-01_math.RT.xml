      <title>Representation Theory of $0$-Schur Algebras and Related Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jensen, Su, and Yang described the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Schur algebra $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ using its geometric realization. In this paper, the simple modules of $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$ are identified by computing the tops of the projective indecomposable modules. Furthermore, functorial relations among the module categories $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$\textsf{-mod}, $\mathbf{S}_0(n,r)$\textsf{-mod}, and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$\textsf{-mod} are examined, where $\mathbf{H}_r(0)$ denotes the $0$-Hecke algebra and $U_0(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ denotes the degenerate quantum group.</description>

      <title>The type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the type I dichotomy for two-step nilpotent locally compact groups. Invoking work of Baggett-Kleppner, we characterize the closed points of the unitary dual of such a group $G$ purely in terms of the group structure. An algebraic criterion characterizing when $G$ is a type I group is derived. We show that this criterion automatically holds if $G$ is a central extension of vector groups over a non-discrete locally compact field $k$ such that the commutator map is $k$-bilinear. As an application, we show that the unipotent radicals of minimal parabolics in simple algebraic groups of $k$-rank one are type I groups. We also discuss the type I dichotomy for $p$-torsion contraction groups, and exhibit, for each prime $p$, uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic such groups that are not type I. This answers a recently posed question by the second author. Finally, we adapt a recent construction of Chirvasitu to obtain numerous examples of two-step nilpotent torsion locally compact groups that are not type I, but that embed as closed cocompact normal subgroups in two-step nilpotent groups that are type I.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalences, matrix equivalences, and homological conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralizer matrix algebras were investigated initially by Georg Ferdinand Frobenius in the Crelle's Journal around 1877. By introducing three new equivalence relations on all square matrices over a field, we completely characterize Morita, derived and almost $\nu$-stable derived equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras in terms of these matrix equivalences, respectively. Thus the categorical equivalences are reduced to matrix equivalences in linear algebra. Further, we show that a derived equivalence between centralizer matrix algebras of permutation matrices induces both a Morita equivalence and additional derived equivalences for $p$-regular parts and for $p$-singular parts. As applications, we show that the finitistic dimension conjecture and Nakayama conjecture are valid for centralizer matrix algebras.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic flows on flat vector bundles with an application to complete affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k &lt; n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, each element of it has a singular value that is uniformly bounded above and below. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show this holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</description>

      <title>The Tits construction for short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-super-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Tits construction for Lie superalgebras such that $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ acts by even derivations and decompose, as $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-module, into a direct sum of copies of the adjoint, the natural and the trivial representations.
  This construction generalizes the one provided by Elduque et al in \cite{EBCC23}, and it is possible to described the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superstructure in terms of $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebras as a super version of the defined by Allison. We extend the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction and the Tits-Allison-Gao functor that define a short $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Lie superalgebra from a $\mathcal{J}$-ternary superalgebra $(\mathcal{J},\mathcal{M})$. Our setting includes and generalizes both \cite{EBCC23} and Shang's \cite{S22}.</description>

      <title>On Harish-Chandra's Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the text of a talk given by the first author at the Harish-Chandra centenary meeting held in Allahabad in October 2023. It reviews Harish-Chandra's isomorphism and its many applications to representation theory and mathematical physics. It also announces the existence and uniqueness of nonsymmetric shift operators for an arbitrary root system. These are differential-reflection operators with a transmutation property relative to Dunkl-Cherednik operators: they shift the parameter k of these operators by 1, and restrict on symmetric functions to the hypergeometric shift operators introduced by the first author.</description>

      <title>Categorification of $k$-Schur functions and refined Macdonald positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the $k$-Schur functions as the graded characters of simple objects in an additive module category. This confirms a set of conjectures formulated in the Ph.D. thesis of Chen, written under the direction of Mark Haiman, and thereby establishes the algebraic framework proposed therein. As a consequence, we deduce that the modified Macdonald polynomials are $k$-Schur positive, thus realizing the original motivation behind the definition of the $k$-Schur functions by Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse. Our approach builds on our previous work on the algebraic and geometric realization of Catalan symmetric functions, which encompasses both the $k$-Schur functions and the Hall--Littlewood functions.</description>

      <title>An introduction to representation-theoretic canonical bases of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an introduction to cluster algebras and their common triangular bases. These bases are Kazhdan-Lusztig-type and serve as the canonical bases of cluster algebras from the representation-theoretic point of view. We review seeds associated with signed words, cluster operations (freezing and base change), the extension technique from finite to infinite rank, which are convenient tools to study these algebras and their bases. We present recent results on the topic and provide examples. An appendix collects detailed examples of some cluster algebras from Lie theory, including those from Lie groups and representations of quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>A construction of simple-minded systems over domestic Brauer graph algebras I: the 2-domestic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a 2-domestic Brauer graph algebra. We present a construction for a family of objects on $A$-$\stmod$ to be a simple-minded system and our construction provides all simple-minded systems on $A$-$\stmod$. As a byproduct, we provide a new proof of AR-conjecture for 2-domestic Brauer graph algebras and we prove that a weakly simple-minded system with a finite cardinality is a simple-minded system on $A$-$\stmod$. We also prove that an orthogonal system $\mathcal{S}$ which contains at least one object for an Euclidean component extends to a simple-minded system on $A$-$\stmod$ and its extension closure $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S})$ is functorially finite.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of a generalized flag variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simply connected semisimple complex algebraic group and $P\, \subset\, G$ a parabolic subgroup. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a line bundle -- on the blow-up of the generalized flag variety $G/P$ along a smooth Schubert variety -- to be ample (respectively, nef). Furthermore, it is shown that every such nef line bundle is actually globally generated. As a consequence, we are able to describe when such a blow-up is (weak) Fano.</description>
