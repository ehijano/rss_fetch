      <title>Resonance energies and linewidths of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons are the solid-state analog of Rydberg atoms and can, e.g., for cuprous oxide, easily reach a large size in the region of $\mu$m for principal quantum numbers up to $n=25$. The fabrication of quantum well-like structures in the crystal leads to quantum confinement effects and opens the possibility to study a crossover from three-dimensional to two-dimensional excitons. For small widths of the quantum well (QW) there are several well separated Rydberg series between various scattering thresholds leading to the occurrence of electron-hole resonances with finite lifetimes above the lowest threshold. By application of the stabilization method to the parametric dependencies of the real-valued eigenvalues of the original three-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation we calculate the resonance energies and linewidths for Rydberg excitons in QWs in regimes where a perturbative treatment is impossible. The positions and finite linewidths of resonances at energies above the third threshold are compared with the complex resonance energies obtained within the framework of the complex-coordinate-rotation technique. The excellent agreement between the results demonstrates the validity of both methods for intermediate sizes of the QW-like structures, and thus for arbitrary widths.</description>

      <title>Light-element and purely charge-based topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a class of Hamiltonians characterized by interatomic, interorbital even-odd parity hybridization as a model for a family of topological insulators without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Non-trivial properties of these materials are exemplified by studying the topologically-protected edge states of s-p hybridized alkali and alkaline earth atoms in one and two-dimensional lattices. In 1D the topological features are analogous to the canonical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but, remarkably, occur in the absence of dimerization. Alkaline earth chains, with Be standing out due to its gap size and near particle-hole symmetry, are of particular experimental interest since their Fermi energy without doping lies directly at the level of topological edge stats. Similar physics is demonstrated to occur in a 2D honeycomb lattice system of s-p bonded atoms, where dispersive edge states emerge. Lighter elements are predicted using this model to host topological states in contrast to spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversion favoring heaving atoms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic process for upconversion photoluminescence via $K$-momentum phonon coupling in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic microscopic mechanism of photon upconversion in air-suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes through photoluminescence and upconversion photoluminescence spectroscopy. Nearly linear excitation power dependence of upconversion photoluminescence intensity is observed, indicating a one-photon process as the underlying mechanism. In addition, we find a strongly anisotropic response to the excitation polarization which reflects the intrinsic nature of the upconversion process. In upconversion photoluminescence excitation spectra, three peaks are observed which are similar to photoluminescence sidebands of the $K$-momentum dark singlet exciton. The features in the upconversion photoluminescence excitation spectra are well reproduced by our second-order exciton-phonon interaction model, enabling the determination of phonon energies and relative amplitudes. The analysis reveals that the upconversion photoluminescence can be described as a reverse process of the sideband emission linked to the $K$-momentum phonon modes. The validity of our model is further reinforced by temperature-dependent upconversion photoluminescence excitation measurements reflecting variations in the phonon population. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the resonant exciton-phonon coupling in pristine carbon nanotubes and presents potential for advanced optothermal technologies by engineering the excitation pathways.</description>

      <title>Nagaoka Ferromagnetism in $3 \times 3$ Arrays and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NF) is a long-predicted example of itinerant ferromagnetism (IF) in the Hubbard model that has been studied theoretically for many years. The condition for NF, an infinite onsite Coulomb repulsion and a single hole in a half-filled band, does not arise naturally in materials, and was only realized recently for the first time in experiments on a 2 \times 2 array of gated quantum dots. Atomically precise fabrication of dopant arrays in Si allows for engineering highly controllable systems with complex geometries. This makes dopant arrays a good candidate to study NF in different array geometries through analog quantum simulation. Here we present theoretical simulations done for $3 \times 3$ arrays and larger $N \times N $ arrays of quantum dots, and predict the emergence of different forms of ferromagnetism in different geometries. We find NF in perfect $3 \times 3$ arrays, as well as in $N \times N $ arrays for one hole less than half-filling. The ratio of the Hubbard on-site repulsion U to hopping t that defines the onset of NF increases as N increases, approaching the bulk limit of infinite U for large N. Additional simulations are done for geometries made by removing sites from $N \times N $ arrays. Different forms of ferromagnetism are found for different geometries. Loops show ferromagnetism, but only for three electrons. For loops, the critical U/t for the onset of ferromagnetism decreases as the loop length increases. We show that this different dependence on size for loops and $N \times N $ arrays can be understood by a scaling argument. Our results show how analog quantum simulation with small arrays can elucidate the role of effects including wavefunction connectivity; system geometry, size and symmetry; bulk and edge sites; and kinetic energy in determining the quantum magnetism of small systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Electrical Detection of Spin Chemical Potential Due to Spin Hall Effect in $\beta$-Tungsten and Platinum Using a Pair of Ferromagnetic and Normal Metal Voltage probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Spin Hall Effect (SHE) generates a pure spin current transverse to an applied current in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling, although not detectable through conventional electrical measurement. An intuitive Hall effect like measurement configuration is implemented to directly measure pure spin chemical potential of the accumulated spins at the edges of heavy metal (HM) channels that generates large SHE. A pair of transverse linearly aligned voltage probes in placed in ohmic contact with the top surface of HM , one being a ferromagnetic metal (FM) with non-zero spin polarization and other is the reference metal (RM) with zero polarization of carriers. This combination of FM/RM electrodes is shown to induce an additional voltage proportional to a spin accumulation potential, which is anti symmetric with respect to opposite orientations of FM controlled by a 2D vector magnet. Proof of concept of the measurement scheme is verified by comparing the signs of voltages for HM channels of Tungsten (W) and Platinum (Pt) which are known to generate opposite spin accumulation under similar conditions of applied current. The same devices are also able to detect the reciprocal effect, inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) by swapping the current and voltage leads and the results are consistent with reciprocity principle. Further, exploiting a characteristic feature of W thin film deposition, a series of devices were fabricated with W resistivity varying over a wide range of 10 - 750 $\mu \Omega$-cm and the calculated spin Hall resistivity exhibits a pronounced power law dependence on resistivity. Our measurement scheme combined with almost two decades of HM resistivity variation provides the ideal platform required to test the underlying microscopic mechanism responsible for SHE/ISHE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of an in-plane honeycomb potential and of a photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emulates a photonic/polaritonic analog of bilayer graphene. We show that modulating the SOC magnitude allows to change the overall lattice periodicity, emulating any type of moir\'e-arranged bilayer graphene with a unique all-optical access to the moir\'e band topology. We show that breaking the time-reversal symmetry by an effective exciton-polariton Zeeman splitting opens a large topological gap in the array of moir\'e flat bands. This gap contains one-way topological edge states whose constant group velocity makes an increasingly sharp contrast with the flattening moir\'e bands.</description>

      <title>On the Antiferromagnetic$\unicode{x2013}$Ferromagnetic Phase Transition in Pinwheel Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopatterned magnetic thin films offer a platform for exploration of tailored magnetic properties such as emergent long-range order. A prominent example is artificial spin ice (ASI), where an arrangement of nanoscale magnetic elements, acting as macrospins, interact via their dipolar fields. In this study, we discuss the transition from antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order in a square lattice ASI, as the magnetic elements are gradually rotated through 45{\deg} to a "pinwheel" configuration. The AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition is observed experimentally using synchrotron radiation x-ray spectromicroscopy and occurs for a critical rotation angle of the nanomagnets, contingent upon the dipolar coupling determined by their separation in the lattice. Large-scale magnetic dipole simulations show that the point-dipole approximation fails to capture the correct AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition angle. However, excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using a dumbbell-dipole model which better reflects the actual dipolar fields of the magnets. This model explains the coupling-dependence of the transition angle, another feature not captured by the pointdipole model. Our findings resolve a discrepancy between measurement and theory in previous work on "pinwheel" ASIs. Control of the AF$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition and this revised model open for improved design of magnetic order in nanostructured systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Binarization in Mutually Synchronized Bias Field-free Spin Hall Nano-oscillators for Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutually coupled spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNO) can exhibit binarized phase state, offering pathways to realize Ising machines and efficient neuromorphic hardware. Conventionally, phase binarization is achieved in coupled SHNOs via injecting an external microwave at twice of the oscillator frequency in presence of a biasing magnetic field. However, this technology poses potential challenges of higher energy consumption and complex circuit design. Moreover, fabrication-induced mismatch in SHNO dimensions may hinder mutual synchronization. Addressing these challenges, we demonstrate purely DC current-driven mutual synchronization and phase binarization of two non-identical nanoconstriction SHNOs without biasing magnetic field and microwave injection. We thoroughly investigate these phenomena and underlying mechanisms using micromagnetic simulation. We further demonstrate the bias field-free synchronized SHNO pair efficiently performing a reservoir computing benchmark learning task: sin and square wave classification, utilizing current tunable phase binarization. Our results showcase promising magnetization dynamics of coupled bias field-free SHNOs for future computing applications.</description>

      <title>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. Thus, this analogous valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayer samples present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting, which is measured by their g-factor values that are approximately $-4$. Therefore, for application purposes it is mandatory alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses. Here we investigate the valley Zeeman effect in aged WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ grown monolayers by magneto-photoluminescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures. These samples present a lower energy defect-bound exciton emission related to defects adsorbed during the aging process. While the free excitons of these samples exhibit g-factors between $-3$ and $-4$, their defect-bound excitons present giant effective g-factor values of $-(25.0 \pm 0.2)$ and $-(19.1 \pm 0.2)$ for WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ aged monolayers, respectively. In addition, we observe a significant spin polarization of charge carriers in the defective mid gap states induced by the external magnetic fields. We explain this spin polarized population in terms of a spin-flip transition mechanism, which is also responsible for the magnetic dependent light emission of the defect-bound exciton states. Our work sheds light in the potential of aged TMDs as candidates for spintronic based devices.</description>

      <title>Braiding of Majorana bound states in a driven-dissipative Majorana box setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a system of Majorana box qubits, where each of the Coulomb blockaded boxes is driven by an applied AC voltage and is embedded in a dissipative environment. The AC voltage is applied between a pair of quantum dots, each of which is coupled by tunneling to a Majorana box qubit. Moreover, the dissipation is created by the coupling to an electromagnetic environment. Recent work has shown that in this case the Majorana bound states which form the computational basis can emerge as dark states, which are stabilized by the dissipation. In our work, we show that the same platform can be used to enable topological braiding of these dissipative Majorana bound states. We show that coupling three such Majorana boxes allows a braiding transformation by changing the tunnel amplitudes adiabatically in time.</description>

      <title>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss potential induces a competition between these first and second-order topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity. Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to create matter-wave superposition states is a long-sought-after goal, not only due to its potential applications in the quantum realm but also because of its fundamental implications for studying the quantum properties of gravity. The main challenge in creating a macroscopic quantum interferometer arises from the loss of coherence, primarily through two channels. One channel involves strong coupling with the environment for macroscopic matter, leading to decoherence. The other channel relates to the precision of wave packet overlap, which can occur due to external and internal fluctuations of various sources. The latter introduces a unique challenge for larger-scale masses by perturbing the centre of mass motion of the macroscopic object. Here, we study a particular challenge, namely, the issue of internal degrees of freedom, specifically phonon fluctuations and contrast reduction. This work will investigate the contrast reduction caused by spin-magnetic field and diamagnetic interactions at the phonon occupation level in the quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM) protocol configuration.</description>

      <title>Overcoming temperature limits in the optical cooling of solids using light-dressed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser cooling of solids currently has a temperature floor of 50 - 100 K. We propose a method that could overcome this using defects, such as diamond color centers, with narrow electronic manifolds and bright optical transitions. It exploits the dressed states formed in strong fields which extend the set of phonon transitions and have tunable energies. This allows an enhancement of the cooling power and diminishes the effect of inhomogeneous broadening. We demonstrate these effects theoretically for the silicon-vacancy and the germanium-vacancy, and discuss the role of background absorption, phonon-assisted emission, and non-radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Intercavity polariton slows down dynamics in strongly coupled cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band engineering stands as an efficient route to induce strongly correlated quantum many-body phenomena. Besides inspiring analogies among diverse physical fields, tuning on demand the group velocity is highly attractive in photonics because it allows unconventional flows of light. $\Lambda$-schemes offer a route to control the propagation of light in a lattice-free configurations, enabling exotic phases such as slow-light and allowing for highly optical non-linear systems. Here, we realize room-temperature intercavity Frenkel polaritons excited across two strongly coupled cavities. We demonstrate the formation of a tuneable heavy-polariton, akin to slow light, appearing in the absence of a periodic in-plane potential. Our photonic architecture based on a simple three-level scheme enables the unique spatial segregation of photons and excitons in different cavities and maintains a balanced degree of mixing between them. This unveils a dynamical competition between many-body scattering processes and the underlying polariton nature which leads to an increased fluorescence lifetime. The intercavity polariton features are further revealed under appropriate resonant pumping, where we observe suppression of the polariton fluorescence intensity.</description>

      <title>Identification of graphite with perfect rhombohedral stacking by electronic Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphite (RG) shows strong correlations in its topological flat band and is pivotal for exploring emergent, correlated electronic phenomena. One key advantage is the enhancement of electronic interactions with the increase in the number of rhombohedrally stacked graphene layers. Increasing thickness also leads to an exponential increase in the number of stacking faults, necessitating a precise method to identify flawless rhombohedral stacking. Overcoming this challenge is difficult because the established technique for stacking sequence identification, based on the Raman 2D peak, fails in thick RG samples. We demonstrate that the strong layer dependence of the band structure can be harnessed to identify RG without stacking faults, or alternatively, to detect their presence. For thicknesses ranging from 3 to 12 layers, we show that each perfect RG structure presents distinctive peak positions in electronic Raman scattering (ERS). This measurement can be carried out using a conventional confocal Raman spectrometer at room temperature, using visible excitation wavelengths. Consequently, this overcomes the identification challenge by providing a simple and fast optical measurement technique, thereby helping to establish RG as a platform for studying strong correlations in one of the simplest crystals possible.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of magnetic tunnel junction-based computational random-access memory</title>

Abstract: Conventional computing paradigm struggles to fulfill the rapidly growing demands from emerging applications, especially those for machine intelligence, because much of the power and energy is consumed by constant data transfers between logic and memory modules. A new paradigm, called "computational random-access memory (CRAM)" has emerged to address this fundamental limitation. CRAM performs logic operations directly using the memory cells themselves, without having the data ever leave the memory. The energy and performance benefits of CRAM for both conventional and emerging applications have been well established by prior numerical studies. However, there lacks an experimental demonstration and study of CRAM to evaluate its computation accuracy, which is a realistic and application-critical metrics for its technological feasibility and competitiveness. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Further analysis of scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication shows promising results. These results are then applied to a complete application: a neural network based handwritten digit classifier, as an example to show the connection between the application performance and further MTJ development. The classifier achieved almost-perfect classification accuracy, with reasonable projections of future MTJ development. With the confirmation of MTJ-based CRAM's accuracy, there is a strong case that this technology will have a significant impact on power- and energy-demanding applications of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Soliton formation in an exciton-polariton condensate at a bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are of special interest in photonics due to their theoretically infinite radiative lifetime. Here, we design a structure composed of a GaN layer with guided exciton-polaritons and a TiO$_2$ 1D photonic crystal slab. The photonic BIC hosted by the photonic crystal slab couples with the excitons of GaN to form a polaritonic BIC with a negative mass. This allows condensation to be reached with a low threshold in a structure suitable for electrical injection, paving the way for room-temperature polariton microdevices. We study in detail how the repulsive interaction between exciton-polaritons affects the condensate distribution in reciprocal space and, consequently, the condensate's overlap with the BIC resonance and, therefore, the condensate lifetime. We study an intrinsic contribution related to the formation of a bright soliton and the extrinsic contribution related to the interaction with an excitonic reservoir induced by spatially focused non-resonant pumping. We then study the peculiar dynamics of the condensation process in a BIC state for interacting particles using Boltzmann equations and hybrid Boltzmann-Gross Pitaevskii equations. We find optimal conditions allowing one to benefit from the long lifetime of the BIC for polariton condensation in a real structure.</description>
