      <title>When the center matters: color screening and gluelumps in dihedral lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit.
  Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative False Vacuum Decay Using Lattice Monte Carlo in Imaginary Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for calculating quantum tunneling rates using lattice Monte Carlo simulations in imaginary time. This method is designed with the goal of studying false vacuum decay non-perturbatively on the lattice. To get results in real time, we construct an implicit decay amplitude, inspired by Fermi's Golden Rule, and use spectral reconstruction. To deal with the suppression of the false vacuum state in the Euclidean path integral, we develop a new sampling method which combines results from multiple Monte Carlo simulations. For a simple family of one-dimensional quantum systems, we reproduce the tunneling rates calculated from the Schrodinger equation.</description>

      <title>Higher order net-baryon number cumulants and baryon-strangeness correlations: Comparing QCD results on thepseudo-critical line with RHIC-BES II results on the freeze-out line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lattice QCD results for ratios of net-baryon number cumulants along the pseudo-critical line and compare them with STAR measurements from the RHIC BES-II program. The ratio of first and second order cumulants, $R_{12}^B$, agrees well with corresponding net-proton number cumulants down to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.5$ GeV or baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B/T \le 2$. Likewise higher-order cumulant ratios, $R_{31}^B$ and $R_{42}^B$, show no sign for the existence of a critical point in the parameter range explored with these cumulant ratios. A QCD critical point is unlikely to occur within the BES-II range in collider mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a non-interacting HRG description breaks down for $\mu_B/T &gt; 1$. We further analyze baryon-strangeness correlations normalized by strangeness fluctuations, finding consistency with STAR data at large beam energies but deviations at lower energies. Comparisons of electric-charge and strangeness correlations with STAR and ALICE data also show agreement at high energies, while the deviations at lower energies emphasize the role of unobserved strange resonances and the need for controlled feed-down corrections in baryon-strangeness correlations.</description>

      <title>A Bootstrap Study of Confinement in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Mills theory in AdS$_{4}$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions is expected to undergo a transition as the AdS radius varies, since the boundary data is incompatible with confinement in flat space. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the disappearance of the Dirichlet boundary condition. From the boundary viewpoint, the associated $3d$ CFT is a deformation of a generalised free theory of non-Abelian conserved currents, with the deformation governed by the bulk gauge coupling. We test these scenarios by deriving non-perturbative constraints from the numerical conformal bootstrap of the four-point function of non-Abelian conserved currents. We rule out the scenario in which the boundary current decouples. Bounds on the lightest scalar operators disfavour a bulk Higgs mechanism and instead point to a transition driven by a scalar singlet becoming marginal. We also obtain bounds on other scalar operators and on the current central charge, and we refine character-based techniques incorporating parity and charge-conjugation symmetry to determine the operator spectrum of the $3d$ Generalised Free Vector theory. These results may be of independent interest beyond Yang-Mills theory in AdS.</description>

      <title>Exotic $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ States in Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ Born-Oppenheimer approximation to the $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^0$ and $T_{c\bar s0}^a(2900)^{++}$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration and study mass spectrum and root-mean-square radius values. For this purpose, we use dynamical diquark model. We assume that strange quark is a heavy for the usage of Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Our results strongly indicate that the $T_{c\overline{s}0}^{a}(2900)$ states are best described as composed of axial-vector (spin-1) diquark pairs. Furthermore, the calculated root-mean-square radius, $\langle r^{2}\rangle^{1/2} \approx 0.70-0.80$ fm, which is significantly less than 1 fm, provides compelling evidence that these are compact tetraquarks rather than loosely bound hadronic molecules.</description>

      <title>Using lattice chiral effective theory to study pi-pi scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use lattice field theory to study the finite-volume energy spectrum of the $\pi\pi$ system in $SU(2)$ chiral effective field theory (ChEFT) at leading order in the chiral expansion. We compare our results with the finite volume spectrum obtained from lattice QCD (Blum et al., Phys. Rev. D 107(9):094512, 2023, arXiv:2301.09286 [hep-lat]). Our calculation and the lattice QCD calculation are both performed with the physical pion mass and the same physical volume. However, we find significant differences between the two calculations in the isospin $I=0$ channel. In particular, there is a nearly stable $\sigma$ resonance in our lattice ChEFT calculation, which is absent in the lattice QCD calculation. This likely indicates that ChEFT does not converge well with a naive lattice regularization.</description>
