      <title>The checkerboard copula and dependence concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random vector are not all continuous. Inspired by three motivating examples including simulation from copulas, stress scenarios, and co-risk measures, we propose to use the checkerboard copula, that is, intuitively, the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform as possible within regions of flexibility. We show that the checkerboard copula has the largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of diversification penalty and impact portfolios.</description>

      <title>Risk-Averse Markov Decision Processes through a Distributional Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By adopting a distributional viewpoint on law-invariant convex risk measures, we construct dynamics risk measures (DRMs) at the distributional level. We then apply these DRMs to investigate Markov decision processes, incorporating latent costs, random actions, and weakly continuous transition kernels. Furthermore, the proposed DRMs allow risk aversion to change dynamically. Under mild assumptions, we derive a dynamic programming principle and show the existence of an optimal policy in both finite and infinite time horizons. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the optimality of deterministic actions. For illustration, we conclude the paper with examples from optimal liquidation with limit order books and autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Factor Models for Different Periods of the Electricity Spot Price Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to major shifts in European energy supply, a structural change can be observed in Austrian electricity spot price data starting from the second quarter of the year 2021 onward. In this work we study the performance of two different factor models for the electricity spot price in three different time periods. To this end, we consider three samples of EEX data for the Austrian base load electricity spot price, one from the pre-crises from 2018 to 2021, the second from the time of the crisis from 2021 to 2023 and the whole data from 2018 to 2023. For each of these samples, we investigate the fit of a classical 3-factor model with a Gaussian base signal and one positive and one negative jump signal and compare it with a 4-factor model to assess the effect of adding a second Gaussian base signal to the model. For the calibration of the models we develop a tailor-made Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on Gibbs sampling. To evaluate the model adequacy, we provide simulations of the spot price as well as a posterior predictive check for the 3- and the 4-factor model. We find that the 4-factor model outperforms the 3-factor model in times of non-crises. In times of crises, the second Gaussian base signal does not lead to a better fit of the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding stochastic electricity spot price models in this new market environment. Hence, it serves as a solid base for future research.</description>
