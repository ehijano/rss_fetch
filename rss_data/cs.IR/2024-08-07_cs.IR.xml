      <title>Lifelong Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We primarily focus on the field of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, which has been actively explored recently and poses a significant challenge in effectively enhancing recommender systems with logical reasoning abilities and open-world knowledge. Current mainstream efforts mainly center around injecting personalized information from recommendation models into LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between semantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face three significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in existing works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters as the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users' characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong personalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises effectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and inference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable for large datasets due to training efficiency constraints. Thus, LLMs only see a small fraction of the datasets (e.g., less than 10%) instead of the whole datasets, limiting their exposure to the full training space. To address these problems, we propose RecLoRA. This model incorporates a Personalized LoRA module that maintains independent LoRAs for different users and a Long-Short Modality Retriever that retrieves different history lengths for different modalities, significantly improving performance while adding minimal time cost. Furthermore, we design a Few2Many Learning Strategy, using a conventional recommendation model as a lens to magnify small training spaces to full spaces. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our RecLoRA compared to existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>Relevance meets Diversity: A User-Centric Framework for Knowledge Exploration through Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing recommendations that are both relevant and diverse is a key consideration of modern recommender systems. Optimizing both of these measures presents a fundamental trade-off, as higher diversity typically comes at the cost of relevance, resulting in lower user engagement. Existing recommendation algorithms try to resolve this trade-off by combining the two measures, relevance and diversity, into one aim and then seeking recommendations that optimize the combined objective, for a given number of items to recommend. Traditional approaches, however, do not consider the user interaction with the recommended items.
  In this paper, we put the user at the central stage, and build on the interplay between relevance, diversity, and user behavior. In contrast to applications where the goal is solely to maximize engagement, we focus on scenarios aiming at maximizing the total amount of knowledge encountered by the user. We use diversity as a surrogate of the amount of knowledge obtained by the user while interacting with the system, and we seek to maximize diversity. We propose a probabilistic user-behavior model in which users keep interacting with the recommender system as long as they receive relevant recommendations, but they may stop if the relevance of the recommended items drops. Thus, for a recommender system to achieve a high-diversity measure, it will need to produce recommendations that are both relevant and diverse.
  Finally, we propose a novel recommendation strategy that combines relevance and diversity by a copula function. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology over multiple datasets, and we show that our strategy outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/EricaCoppolillo/EXPLORE.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible Analysis of Sequential Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have emerged as a highly efficient approach to recommendation systems. By leveraging sequential data, SRSs can identify temporal patterns in user behaviour, significantly improving recommendation accuracy and relevance.Ensuring the reproducibility of these models is paramount for advancing research and facilitating comparisons between them. Existing works exhibit shortcomings in reproducibility and replicability of results, leading to inconsistent statements across papers. Our work fills these gaps by standardising data pre-processing and model implementations, providing a comprehensive code resource, including a framework for developing SRSs and establishing a foundation for consistent and reproducible experimentation. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, comparing various SRSs implemented in our resource. We challenge prevailing performance benchmarks, offering new insights into the SR domain. For instance, SASRec does not consistently outperform GRU4Rec. On the contrary, when the number of model parameters becomes substantial, SASRec starts to clearly dominate all the other SRSs. This discrepancy underscores the significant impact that experimental configuration has on the outcomes and the importance of setting it up to ensure precise and comprehensive results. Failure to do so can lead to significantly flawed conclusions, highlighting the need for rigorous experimental design and analysis in SRS research. Our code is available at https://github.com/antoniopurificato/recsys_repro_conf.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmentation via User Interest Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing industrial recommender systems are sensitive to the patterns of user-item engagement. Light users, who interact less frequently, correspond to a data sparsity problem, making it difficult for the system to accurately learn and represent their preferences. On the other hand, heavy users with rich interaction history often demonstrate a variety of niche interests that are hard to be precisely captured under the standard "user-item" similarity measurement. Moreover, implementing these systems in an industrial environment necessitates that they are resource-efficient and scalable to process web-scale data under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing an intermediate "interest" layer between users and items. We propose a novel approach that efficiently constructs user interest and facilitates low computational cost inference by clustering engagement graphs and incorporating user-interest attention. This method enhances the understanding of light users' preferences by linking them with heavy users. By integrating user-interest attention, our approach allows a more personalized similarity metric, adept at capturing the complex dynamics of user-item interactions. The use of interest as an intermediary layer fosters a balance between scalability and expressiveness in the model. Evaluations on two public datasets reveal that our method not only achieves improved recommendation performance but also demonstrates enhanced computational efficiency compared to item-level attention models. Our approach has also been deployed in multiple products at Meta, facilitating short-form video related recommendation.</description>

      <title>The Ontoverse: Democratising Access to Knowledge Graph-based Data Through a Cartographic Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the number of scientific publications and preprints is growing exponentially, several attempts have been made to navigate this complex and increasingly detailed landscape. These have almost exclusively taken unsupervised approaches that fail to incorporate domain knowledge and lack the structural organisation required for intuitive interactive human exploration and discovery. Especially in highly interdisciplinary fields, a deep understanding of the connectedness of research works across topics is essential for generating insights. We have developed a unique approach to data navigation that leans on geographical visualisation and uses hierarchically structured domain knowledge to enable end-users to explore knowledge spaces grounded in their desired domains of interest. This can take advantage of existing ontologies, proprietary intelligence schemata, or be directly derived from the underlying data through hierarchical topic modelling. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques to extract named entities from the underlying data and normalise them against relevant domain references and navigational structures. The knowledge is integrated by first calculating similarities between entities based on their shared extracted feature space and then by alignment to the navigational structures. The result is a knowledge graph that allows for full text and semantic graph query and structured topic driven navigation. This allows end-users to identify entities relevant to their needs and access extensive graph analytics. The user interface facilitates graphical interaction with the underlying knowledge graph and mimics a cartographic map to maximise ease of use and widen adoption. We demonstrate an exemplar project using our generalisable and scalable infrastructure for an academic biomedical literature corpus that is grounded against hundreds of different named domain entities.</description>

      <title>ULLME: A Unified Framework for Large Language Model Embeddings with Generation-Augmented Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks, but leveraging them for dense passage embedding remains challenging. This is due to their causal attention mechanism and the misalignment between their pre-training objectives and the text ranking tasks. Despite some recent efforts to address these issues, existing frameworks for LLM-based text embeddings have been limited by their support for only a limited range of LLM architectures and fine-tuning strategies, limiting their practical application and versatility. In this work, we introduce the Unified framework for Large Language Model Embedding (ULLME), a flexible, plug-and-play implementation that enables bidirectional attention across various LLMs and supports a range of fine-tuning strategies. We also propose Generation-augmented Representation Learning (GRL), a novel fine-tuning method to boost LLMs for text embedding tasks. GRL enforces consistency between representation-based and generation-based relevance scores, leveraging LLMs' powerful generative abilities for learning passage embeddings. To showcase our framework's flexibility and effectiveness, we release three pre-trained models from ULLME with different backbone architectures, ranging from 1.5B to 8B parameters, all of which demonstrate strong performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark. Our framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/ullme. A demo video for ULLME can also be found at https://rb.gy/ws1ile.</description>

      <title>Consumer Transactions Simulation through Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of large-scale retail data systems, envisioning and simulating future consumer transactions has become a crucial area of interest. It offers significant potential to fortify demand forecasting and fine-tune inventory management. This paper presents an innovative application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic retail transaction data, specifically focusing on a novel system architecture that combines consumer behavior modeling with stock-keeping unit (SKU) availability constraints to address real-world assortment optimization challenges. We diverge from conventional methodologies by integrating SKU data into our GAN architecture and using more sophisticated embedding methods (e.g., hyper-graphs). This design choice enables our system to generate not only simulated consumer purchase behaviors but also reflects the dynamic interplay between consumer behavior and SKU availability -- an aspect often overlooked, among others, because of data scarcity in legacy retail simulation models. Our GAN model generates transactions under stock constraints, pioneering a resourceful experimental system with practical implications for real-world retail operation and strategy. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced realism in simulated transactions measured by comparing generated items with real ones using methods employed earlier in related studies. This underscores the potential for more accurate predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Generative Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Short Answer Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Short Answer Scoring (ASAS) is a critical component in educational assessment. While traditional ASAS systems relied on rule-based algorithms or complex deep learning methods, recent advancements in Generative Language Models (GLMs) offer new opportunities for improvement. This study explores the application of GLMs to ASAS, leveraging their off-the-shelf capabilities and performance in various domains. We propose a novel pipeline that combines vector databases, transformer-based encoders, and GLMs to enhance short answer scoring accuracy. Our approach stores training responses in a vector database, retrieves semantically similar responses during inference, and employs a GLM to analyze these responses and determine appropriate scores. We further optimize the system through fine-tuned retrieval processes and prompt engineering. Evaluation on the SemEval 2013 dataset demonstrates a significant improvement on the SCIENTSBANK 3-way and 2-way tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of GLMs in advancing ASAS technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the telecommunication domain presents unique challenges, primarily due to the complex nature of telecom standard documents and the rapid evolution of the field. The paper introduces Telco-RAG, an open-source RAG framework designed to handle the specific needs of telecommunications standards, particularly 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) documents. Telco-RAG addresses the critical challenges of implementing a RAG pipeline on highly technical content, paving the way for applying LLMs in telecommunications and offering guidelines for RAG implementation in other technical domains.</description>

      <title>A general framework for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similarity search is a central problem in domains such as information management and retrieval or data analysis. Many similarity search algorithms are designed or specifically adapted to metric distances. Thus, they are unsuitable for alternatives like the cosine distance, which has become quite common, for example, with embeddings and in text mining. This paper presents GDASC (General Distributed Approximate Similarity search with Clustering), a general framework for distributed approximate similarity search that accepts arbitrary distances. This framework can build a multilevel index structure, by selecting a clustering algorithm, the number of prototypes in each cluster and any arbitrary distance function. As a result, this framework effectively overcomes the limitation of using metric distances and can address situations involving cosine similarity or other non-standard similarity measures. Experimental results using k-medoids clustering in GDASC with real datasets confirm the applicability of this approach for approximate similarity search, improving the performance of extant algorithms for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Wiping out the limitations of Large Language Models -- A Taxonomy for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research on RAGs is distributed across various disciplines, and since the technology is evolving very quickly, its unit of analysis is mostly on technological innovations, rather than applications in business contexts. Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. When discussing our findings, we also detail the specific research areas and pose key research questions to guide future information system researchers as they explore the emerging topics of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling User Intent Beyond Trigger: Incorporating Uncertainty for Trigger-Induced Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To cater to users' desire for an immersive browsing experience, numerous e-commerce platforms provide various recommendation scenarios, with a focus on Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) tasks. However, the majority of current TIR methods heavily rely on the trigger item to understand user intent, lacking a higher-level exploration and exploitation of user intent (e.g., popular items and complementary items), which may result in an overly convergent understanding of users' short-term intent and can be detrimental to users' long-term purchasing experiences. Moreover, users' short-term intent shows uncertainty and is affected by various factors such as browsing context and historical behaviors, which poses challenges to user intent modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model called Deep Uncertainty Intent Network (DUIN), comprising three essential modules: i) Explicit Intent Exploit Module extracting explicit user intent using the contrastive learning paradigm; ii) Latent Intent Explore Module exploring latent user intent by leveraging the multi-view relationships between items; iii) Intent Uncertainty Measurement Module offering a distributional estimation and capturing the uncertainty associated with user intent. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DUIN compared to existing baselines. Notably, DUIN has been deployed across all TIR scenarios in our e-commerce platform, with online A/B testing results conclusively validating its superiority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LiRank, a large-scale ranking framework at LinkedIn that brings to production state-of-the-art modeling architectures and optimization methods. We unveil several modeling improvements, including Residual DCN, which adds attention and residual connections to the famous DCNv2 architecture. We share insights into combining and tuning SOTA architectures to create a unified model, including Dense Gating, Transformers and Residual DCN. We also propose novel techniques for calibration and describe how we productionalized deep learning based explore/exploit methods. To enable effective, production-grade serving of large ranking models, we detail how to train and compress models using quantization and vocabulary compression. We provide details about the deployment setup for large-scale use cases of Feed ranking, Jobs Recommendations, and Ads click-through rate (CTR) prediction. We summarize our learnings from various A/B tests by elucidating the most effective technical approaches. These ideas have contributed to relative metrics improvements across the board at LinkedIn: +0.5% member sessions in the Feed, +1.76% qualified job applications for Jobs search and recommendations, and +4.3% for Ads CTR. We hope this work can provide practical insights and solutions for practitioners interested in leveraging large-scale deep ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Detecting and Mitigating Cognitive Bias in Spoken Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruments such as eye-tracking devices have contributed to understanding how users interact with screen-based search engines. However, user-system interactions in audio-only channels -- as is the case for Spoken Conversational Search (SCS) -- are harder to characterize, given the lack of instruments to effectively and precisely capture interactions. Furthermore, in this era of information overload, cognitive bias can significantly impact how we seek and consume information -- especially in the context of controversial topics or multiple viewpoints. This paper draws upon insights from multiple disciplines (including information seeking, psychology, cognitive science, and wearable sensors) to provoke novel conversations in the community. To this end, we discuss future opportunities and propose a framework including multimodal instruments and methods for experimental designs and settings. We demonstrate preliminary results as an example. We also outline the challenges and offer suggestions for adopting this multimodal approach, including ethical considerations, to assist future researchers and practitioners in exploring cognitive biases in SCS.</description>

Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) can be risky and, in various circumstances, can produce sub-optimal models that hurt performance when deployed. Safe CLTR was introduced to mitigate these risks when using inverse propensity scoring to correct for position bias. However, the existing safety measure for CLTR is not applicable to state-of-the-art CLTR methods, cannot handle trust bias, and relies on specific assumptions about user behavior. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we generalize the existing safe CLTR approach to make it applicable to state-of-the-art doubly robust CLTR and trust bias. Second, we propose a novel approach, proximal ranking policy optimization (PRPO), that provides safety in deployment without assumptions about user behavior. PRPO removes incentives for learning ranking behavior that is too dissimilar to a safe ranking model. Thereby, PRPO imposes a limit on how much learned models can degrade performance metrics, without relying on any specific user assumptions. Our experiments show that both our novel safe doubly robust method and PRPO provide higher performance than the existing safe inverse propensity scoring approach. However, in unexpected circumstances, the safe doubly robust approach can become unsafe and bring detrimental performance. In contrast, PRPO always maintains safety, even in maximally adversarial situations. By avoiding assumptions, PRPO is the first method with unconditional safety in deployment that translates to robust safety for real-world applications.</description>
