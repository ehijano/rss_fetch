      <title>Relay synchronization and control of dynamics in multiplex networks with unidirectional inter layer coupling</title>

Abstract: Multiplex networks provide a proper framework for understanding the dynamics of complex systems with differing types of interactions. This study considers different dynamical states possible in a multiplex network of nonlinear oscillators, with a drive layer and two identical response layers where the interlayer interactions are unidirectional. We report how the directionality in coupling can lead to relay synchronization with amplification in the two response layers through feedback from the middle drive layer. The amplitude of synchronized oscillations of response layers can be controlled by tuning the strength of interlayer coupling. Moreover, we find the synchronization patterns that emerge in the response layers depend on the nature of interlayer coupling, whether feedback or diffusive, and the time scale or parameter mismatches between drive and response layers. Thus, the study indicates the potential for controlling and optimizing the dynamics of response layers remotely by adjusting the strength of interlayer coupling or tuning the dynamic time scale of the drive layer.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reservoir Computers</title>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</description>

      <title>Competing aggregation and iso-density equilibrium lead to band pattern formation in density gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrifugation of biological matter in density gradient solutions is a standard method for separating cell types or components. It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between isodensity distribution and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and iso-density distribution is a novel mechanism driving pattern formation.</description>
