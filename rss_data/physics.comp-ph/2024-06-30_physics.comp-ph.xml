      <title>Neural Network Representations of Multiphase Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equations of State model relations between thermodynamic variables and are ubiquitous in scientific modelling, appearing in modern day applications ranging from Astrophysics to Climate Science. The three desired properties of a general Equation of State model are adherence to the Laws of Thermodynamics, incorporation of phase transitions, and multiscale accuracy. Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either "from scratch" to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower shapes of bacterial clusters in the off-lattice Eden model for bacterial growth in a Petri dish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed the off-lattice Eden model to simulate the growth of bacterial colonies in the three-dimensional geometry of a Petri dish. In contrast to its two-dimensional counterpart, our model takes a three-dimensional set of possible growth directions and employs additional constraints on growth, limited by access to the nutrient layer. We rigorously tested the basic off-lattice Eden implementation against literature data in the case of a planar cluster. Then, we extended it for three-dimensional growth. Our model successfully demonstrated the non-trivial dependency of the cluster morphology, the non-monotonous dependency of the cluster density, and the power-law of the thickness of the boundary layer of clusters in the function of the nutrient layer height. Moreover, we revealed the fractal nature of all clusters by investigating their fractal dimensions. Our density results allowed us to estimate the basic transport properties, namely permeability and tortuosity of bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Electronic and Mechanical Properties of TPDH-Nanotube: Insights from Ab initio and Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetra-Penta-Deca-Hexa-graphene (TPDH) is a new 2D carbon allotrope with attractive electronic and mechanical properties. It is composed of tetragonal, pentagonal, and hexagonal carbon rings. When TPDH-graphene is sliced into quasi-one-dimensional (1D) structures like nanoribbons, it exhibits a range of behaviors, from semi-metallic to semiconducting. An alternative approach to achieving these desirable electronic (electronic confinement and/or non-zero electronic band gap) properties is the creation of nanotubes (TPDH-NT). In the present work, we carried out a comprehensive study of TPDH-NTs combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Classical Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MD). Our results show structural stability and a chiral dependence on mechanical properties. Similarly to standard carbon nanotubes, TPDH-NT can be metallic or semiconductor. MD results show Young's modulus values exceeding $700$ GPa, except for nanotubes with very small radii. However, certain chiral TPDH-NTs (n,m) display values both below and above $700$ GPa, particularly for those with small radii. The analyses of the angle and C-C bond length distributions underscore the significance of the tetragonal and pentagonal rings in determining the mechanical response of TPDH-NTs (n,0) and (0,n), respectively.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Monte Carlo algorithms for random trees with controlled branching activity: efficient trial move generation and universal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reptation Monte Carlo algorithm is a simple, physically motivated and efficient method for equilibrating semi-dilute solutions of linear polymers. Here we propose two simple generalizations for the analogue {\it Amoeba} algorithm for randomly branching chains, which allow to efficiently deal with random trees with controlled branching activity. We analyse the rich relaxation dynamics of Amoeba algorithms and demonstrate the existence of an unexpected scaling regime for the tree relaxation. In particular, our results suggests that the equilibration time for Amoeba algorithms scales in general like $N^2 \langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle^\Delta$, where $N$ denotes the number of tree nodes, $\langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle$ the mean number of linear segments the trees are composed of and $\Delta \simeq 0.4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have attracted attention recently as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for scientific machine learning. However, KANs can be expensive to train, even for relatively small networks. Inspired by finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs), in this work, we develop a domain decomposition method for KANs that allows for several small KANs to be trained in parallel to give accurate solutions for multiscale problems. We show that finite basis KANs (FBKANs) can provide accurate results with noisy data and for physics-informed training.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Predicting Topological Entanglement Entropy in a Rydberg analog simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamical properties of topological matter is a challenging task, not only in theoretical and experimental settings, but also numerically. This work proposes a variational approach based on a time-dependent correlated Ansatz, focusing on the dynamical preparation of a quantum-spin-liquid state on a Rydberg-atom simulator. Within this framework, we are able to faithfully represent the state of the system throughout the entire dynamical preparation protocol. The flexibility of our approach does not only allow one to match the physically correct form of the Rydberg-atom Hamiltonian but also the relevant lattice topology. This is unlike previous numerical studies which were constrained to simplified versions of the problem through the modification of both the Hamiltonian and the lattice. Our approach further gives access to global quantities such as the topological entanglement entropy ($\gamma$), providing insight into the topological properties of the system. This is achieved by the introduction of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (t-VMC) technique to the dynamics of topologically ordered phases. Upon employing a Jastrow variational Ansatz with a scalable number of parameters, we are able to efficiently extend our simulations to system sizes matching state-of-the-art experiments and beyond. Our results corroborate experimental observations, confirming the presence of topological order during the dynamical state-preparation protocol, and additionally deepen our understanding of topological entanglement dynamics. We show that, while the simulated state exhibits (global) topological order and local properties resembling those of a resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state, it lacks the latter's characteristic topological entanglement entropy signature $\gamma = \ln(2)$, irrespective of the degree of adiabaticity of the protocol.</description>

      <title>A Python-based flow solver for numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method on single GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation for running three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction problems on single GPUs, based on Nvidia CUDA through Numba and Python. The incompressible flow around moving bodies is solved in this framework through an implementation of the Immersed Boundary Method tailored for the GPU, where different GPU grid architectures are exploited to optimize the overall performance. By targeting a single-GPU, we avoid GPU-CPU and GPU-GPU communication bottlenecks, since all the simulation data is always in the global memory of the GPU. We provide details about the numerical methodology, the implementation of the algorithm in the GPU and the memory management, critical in single-GPU implementations. Additionally, we verify the results comparing with our analogous CPU-based parallel solver and assess satisfactorily the efficiency of the code in terms of the relative computing time of the different operations and the scaling of the CPU code compared to a single GPU case. Overall, our tests show that the single-GPU code is between 34 to 54 times faster than the CPU solver in peak performance (96-128 CPU cores). This speedup mainly comes from the change in the method of solution of the linear systems of equations, while the speedup in sections of the algorithm that are equivalent in the CPU and GPU implementations is more modest (i.e., $\times 1.6-3$ speedup in the computation of the non-linear terms). Finally, we showcase the performance of this new GPU implementation in two applications of interest, one for external flows (i.e., bioinspired aerodynamics) and one for internal flows (i.e., cardiovascular flows), demonstrating the strong scaling of the code in two different GPU cards (hardware).%\red{for both single and double precision.}</description>

      <title>Integrating Quantum Algorithms Into Classical Frameworks: A Predictor-corrector Approach Using HHL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of quantum algorithms to classical problems is generally accompanied by significant bottlenecks when transferring data between quantum and classical states, often negating any intrinsic quantum advantage. Here we address this challenge for a well-known algorithm for linear systems of equations, originally proposed by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd (HHL), by adapting it into a predictor-corrector instead of a direct solver. Rather than seeking the solution at the next time step, the goal now becomes determining the change between time steps. This strategy enables the intelligent omission of computationally costly steps commonly found in many classical algorithms, while simultaneously mitigating the notorious readout problems associated with extracting solutions from a quantum state. Random or regularly performed skips instead lead to simulation failure. We demonstrate that our methodology secures a useful polynomial advantage over a conventional application of the HHL algorithm. The practicality and versatility of the approach are illustrated through applications in various fields such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, plasma simulations, and reactive flow configurations. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is well suited to run asynchronously on future heterogeneous hardware infrastructures and can effectively leverage the synergistic strengths of classical as well as quantum compute resources.</description>

      <title>Neural Differentiable Modeling with Diffusion-Based Super-resolution for Two-Dimensional Spatiotemporal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Robustly learning the Hamiltonian dynamics of a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The required precision to perform quantum simulations beyond the capabilities of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges. The key to solving these issues are precise means of characterizing analog quantum simulators. Here, we robustly estimate the free Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic excitations in a superconducting-qubit analog quantum simulator from measured time-series of single-mode canonical coordinates. We achieve high levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian parameters by exploiting a priori knowledge, making it robust against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Importantly, we are also able to obtain tomographic information about those SPAM errors from the same data, crucial for the experimental applicability of Hamiltonian learning in dynamical quantum-quench experiments. Our learning algorithm is scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique coined tensorESPRIT for frequency extraction from matrix time-series. The algorithm then combines tensorESPRIT with constrained manifold optimization for the eigenspace reconstruction with pre- and post-processing stages. For up to 14 coupled superconducting qubits on two Sycamore processors, we identify the Hamiltonian parameters -- verifying the implementation on one of them up to sub-MHz precision -- and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our results constitute an accurate implementation of a dynamical quantum simulation that is characterized using a new diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient dimension-by-dimension finite-volume method which solves the adiabatic magnetohydrodynamics equations at high discretization order, using the constrained-transport approach on Cartesian grids. Results are presented up to tenth order of accuracy. This method requires only one reconstructed value per face for each computational cell. A passage through high-order point values leads to a modest growth of computational cost with increasing discretization order. At a given resolution, these high-order schemes present significantly less numerical dissipation than commonly employed lower-order approaches. Thus, results of comparable accuracy are achievable at a substantially coarser resolution, yielding overall performance gains. We also present a way to include physical dissipative terms: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity and cooling functions, respecting the finite-volume and constrained-transport frameworks.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform periodic interpolation method for superposition sums in a periodic unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Fast Fourier Transform based Periodic Interpolation Method (FFT-PIM), a flexible and computationally efficient approach for computing the scalar potential given by a superposition sum in a unit cell of an infinitely periodic array. Under the same umbrella, FFT-PIM allows computing the potential for 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities for dynamic and static problems, including problems with and without a periodic phase shift. The computational complexity of the FFT-PIM is of $O(N \log N)$ for $N$ spatially coinciding sources and observer points. The FFT-PIM uses rapidly converging series representations of the Green's function serving as a kernel in the superposition sum. Based on these representations, the FFT-PIM splits the potential into its near-zone component, which includes a small number of images surrounding the unit cell of interest, and far-zone component, which includes the rest of an infinite number of images. The far-zone component is evaluated by projecting the non-uniform sources onto a sparse uniform grid, performing superposition sums on this sparse grid, and interpolating the potential from the uniform grid to the non-uniform observation points. The near-zone component is evaluated using an FFT-based method, which is adapted to efficiently handle non-uniform source-observer distributions within the periodic unit cell. The FFT-PIM can be used for a broad range of applications, such as periodic problems involving integral equations in computational electromagnetic and acoustic, micromagnetic solvers, and density functional theory solvers.</description>

Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Graph Foundation Models for Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study with HydraGNN</title>

Abstract: We present our work on developing and training scalable graph foundation models (GFM) using HydraGNN, a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>
