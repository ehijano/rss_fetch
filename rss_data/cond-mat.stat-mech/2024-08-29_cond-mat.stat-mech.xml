      <title>Volume Changing Symmetries by Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spin chain models with exotic symmetries that change the length of the spin chain. It is known that the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain at the supersymmetric point $\Delta=-1/2$ possesses such a symmetry: it is given by the supersymmetry generators, which change the length of the chain by one unit. We show that volume changing symmetries exist also in other spin chain models, and that they can be constructed using a special tensor network, which is a simple generalization of a Matrix Product Operator. As examples we consider the folded XXZ model and its perturbations, and also a new hopping model that is defined on constrained Hilbert spaces. We show that the volume changing symmetries are not related to integrability: the symmetries can survive even non-integrable perturbations. We also show that the known supersymmetry generator of the XXZ chain with $\Delta=-1/2$ can also be expressed as a generalized Matrix Product Operator.</description>

      <title>First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Identifying Influential and Vulnerable Nodes in Interaction Networks through Estimation of Transfer Entropy Between Univariate and Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer entropy (TE) is a powerful tool for measuring causal relationships within interaction networks. Traditionally, TE and its conditional variants are applied pairwise between dynamic variables to infer these causal relationships. However, identifying the most influential or vulnerable node in a system requires measuring the causal influence of each component on the entire system and vice versa. In this paper, I propose using outgoing and incoming transfer entropy-where outgoing TE quantifies the influence of a node on the rest of the system, and incoming TE measures the influence of the rest of the system on the node. The node with the highest outgoing TE is identified as the most influential, or "hub", while the node with the highest incoming TE is the most vulnerable, or "anti-hub". Since these measures involve transfer entropy between univariate and multivariate time series, naive estimation methods can result in significant errors, particularly when the number of variables is comparable to or exceeds the number of samples. To address this, I introduce a novel estimation scheme that computes outgoing and incoming TE only between significantly interacting partners. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by using synthetic data, and by applying it to a real data of oral microbiota. The method successfully identifies the bacterial species known to be key players in the bacterial community, demonstrating the power of the new method.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$, which seem no less realistic than $H_\theta$, and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>A note on defect stability in $d=4-\varepsilon$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the space of scalar line, surface and interface defect field theories in $d=4-\varepsilon$ by examining their stability properties under generic deformations. Examples are known of multiple stable line defect Conformal Field Theories (dCFTs) existing simultaneously, unlike the case of normal multiscalar field theories where a theorem by Michel guarantees that the stable fixed point is the unique global minimum of a so-called $A$-function. We prove that a suitable modification of Michel's theorem survives for line defect theories, with fixed points locally rather than globally minimizing an $A$-function along a specified surface in coupling space and provide a novel classification of the fixed points in the hypertetrahedral line defect model. For surface defects Michel's theorem survives almost untouched, and we explore bulk models for which the symmetry preserving defect is the unique stable point. In the case of interface theories, we prove that for any critical bulk model there can exist no fixed points stable under generic deformations for $N\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Deep thermalization under charge-conserving quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Deep thermalization'' describes the emergence of universal wavefunction distributions in quantum many-body dynamics, appearing on a local subsystem upon measurement of its environment. In this work, we study in detail the effect of continuous internal symmetries and associated conservation laws on deep thermalization. Concretely, we consider quantum spin systems with a $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the conservation of magnetization (or `charge'), and analyze how the choice of initial states (specifically, their degree of charge fluctuations) and the choice of measurement basis (specifically, whether or not it can reveal information about the local charge density) determine the ensuing universal wavefunction distributions. We find a rich set of possibilities. First we focus on the case of a random state of well-defined charge subjected to charge-revealing masurements, and rigorously prove that the projected ensemble approaches a direct sum of Haar ensembles in the charge sectors of the subsystem of interest. We then analytically derive the limiting wavefunction distributions for more general initial states and measurement bases, finding results that include the Haar ensemble, the ``Scrooge ensemble'' (a distortion of the Haar ensemble by a density matrix), and the ``generalized Scrooge ensemble'' (a stochastic mixture of multiple Scrooge ensembles). These represent nontrivial higher-moment generalizations of the Gibbs state, and notably can depend on the entire charge distribution of the initial state, not just its average. Our findings demonstrate a rich interplay between symmetries and the information extracted by measurements, which allows deep thermalization to exhibit a range of universal behaviors far beyond regular thermalization.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, boundary modes, and the necessity of unnecessary criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We link the presence of "unnecessary" quantum critical surfaces within a single gapped phase of matter to the non-trivial topology of families of gapped Hamiltonians that encircle the critical surface. We study a specific set of one-dimensional spin models where each such family forms a one-parameter loop in a two-dimensional phase diagram. Foliating the non-critical region by such loops identifies "radial" and "angular" coordinates in the phase diagram that respectively parametrize different families and different members of a single family. We show that each one-parameter family is a generalized Thouless charge pump, all with the same topological index, and hence the gapped phase undergoes one or more nontrivial boundary phase transitions as we vary the angular coordinate in a loop through members of one family. Tuning the radial coordinate generates loci of boundary critical points that terminate at endpoints of the bulk unnecessary critical line within the gapped phase. We discuss broader implications of our results and possible extensions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Adsorption of Guanidinium Cations to the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining Deep-UV second harmonic generation spectroscopy with molecular simulations, we confirm and quantify the specific adsorption of guanidinium cations to the air-water interface. Using a Langmuir analysis and measurements at multiple concentrations, we extract the Gibbs free energy of adsorption, finding it larger than typical thermal energies. Molecular simulations clarify the role of polarizability in tuning the thermodynamics of adsorption, and establish the preferential parallel alignment of guanidinium at the air-water interface. Guanidinium is the first polyatomic cation proven to exhibit a propensity for the air-water interface. As such, these results expand on the growing body of work on specific ion adsorption.</description>

      <title>Integer Topological Defects Reveal Effective Forces in Active Nematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell layers are often categorized as contractile or extensile active nematics but recent experiments on neural progenitor cells with induced $+1$ topological defects challenge this classification. In a bottom-up approach, we first study a relevant particle-level model and then analyze a continuous theory derived from it. We show that both model and theory account qualitatively for the main experimental result, i.e. accumulation of cells at the core of any type of +1 defect. We argue that cell accumulation is essentially due to two generally ignored 'effective active forces'.
  We finally discuss the relevance and consequences of our findings in the context of other cellular active nematics experiments and previously proposed theories.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-range opposite charge repulsion in multivalent salt solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrostatic correlations between ions profoundly influence the structure and forces within electrical double layers. Here, we apply the modified Gaussian Renormalized Fluctuation theory to investigate the counter-intuitive phenomenon of repulsion between two oppositely charged surfaces and discuss its relationship with overcharging. By accurately accounting for the effect of spatially varying ion-ion correlations, we capture these repulsive forces for divalent, trivalent as well as tetravalent ions, in quantitative agreement with reported simulation results. We show that the opposite-charge repulsion is long-ranged with an effective length scale of a few nanometers. The strength of opposite-charge repulsion increases monotonically with the multivalent salt concentration, in stark contrast with the non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of other ion correlation-driven phenomena, such as overcharging and like-charge attraction. We also elucidate that the origin of the opposite-charge repulsion is the large amount of ions attracted to the double layer as a result of ion-ion correlations, leading to higher osmotic pressure and stronger screening of the electrostatic attraction, which results in an overall repulsive force between two oppositely charged surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is no causal relationship between opposite-charge repulsion and the overcharging of the surface. Opposite-charge repulsion is accompanied by overcharging at large separation distances, but can also occur in normal double layers without overcharging at intermediate separation distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of using simple macroscopic examples to illustrate the physics of complex systems, we modify a historic experimental setup in which interacting floating magnets spontaneously self-assemble into ordered clusters. By making the cluster components mechanically stable against their natural tendency to flip and coalesce, we can monitor the torque experienced by individual magnets through the macroscopic tilt angles they acquire when exposed to non-collinear external fields. A mathematical model that reproduces the empirical observations is introduced, enabling us to go beyond the experimental cases considered. The model confirms the existence of alternative orderings as the number of objects increases. Furthermore, a simpler and more mathematically transparent version of our model enables us to establish the conditions under which the cluster structure is stable and when it will collapse. We argue that our simple experimental setup combined with the accompanying models may be useful to describe general features seen in systems composed of mutually repulsive particles in the presence of modulating confining fields.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals on Dependence of Volume on Pressure and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common wisdom that volume decreases with pressure and increases with temperature is analyzed in terms of Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the present work. It is shown that the derivative of volume to pressure in a stable system is always negative, i.e., volume decreases with the increase of pressure, when all other natural variables of the system are kept constant. This originates from the stability requirement that the conjugate variables, such as volume and negative pressure, must change in the same direction in a stable system. Consequently, since volume and temperature are not conjugate variables, they do not have to change in the same direction and thus do change in opposite directions in both natural and man-made systems. It is shown that the decrease of volume with the increase of temperature, commonly referred as negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the literature, originates from the statistical competitions of configurations in the system when the volumes of metastable configurations are smaller than that of the ground-state configuration. It is demonstrated that the zentropy theory can concisely explain and accurately predict NTE based on the density functional theory without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy and Mutual Information in Gaussian Statistical Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a powerful measure of the dissimilarity between two statistical field theories in the continuum. In this work, we study the relative entropy between Gaussian scalar field theories in a finite volume with different masses and boundary conditions. We show that the relative entropy depends crucially on $d$, the dimension of Euclidean space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mutual information between two disjoint regions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is finite if the two regions are separated by a finite distance and satisfies an area law. We then construct an example of "touching" regions between which the mutual information is infinite. We argue that the properties of mutual information in scalar field theories can be explained by the Markov property of these theories.</description>

      <title>Can helicity modulus be defined for boundary conditions with finite twist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of a two-dimensional classical XY model to a finite (non-infinitesimal) twist of the boundary conditions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the free energy difference between periodic and twisted-periodic boundary conditions and find deviations from the expected quadratic dependence on the twist angle. Consequently, the helicity modulus (spin-stiffness) shows a non-trivial dependence on the twist angle. We show that the deviation from the expected behavior arises because of the mixing of states with opposite chirality which leads to an additional entropy contribution in the quasi-long-range ordered phase. We give an improved prescription for the numerical evaluation of the helicity modulus, and we discuss the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry for anti-periodic boundary conditions. We also discuss applications to discrete spin systems and some experimental scenarios where boundary conditions with finite twist are necessary.</description>

Abstract: R\'enyi entropy is a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, which has been used in various fields of physics. Despite its wide applicability, the physical interpretations of the R\'enyi entropy are not widely known. In this paper, we discuss some basic properties of the R\'enyi entropy relevant to physics, in particular statistical mechanics, and its physical interpretations using free energy, replicas, work, and large deviation.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator phases in one dimensional quasi-periodic mechanical SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21550v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition between topological phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model composed of springs and masses in which the intracellular Aubry-Andr\'e disorder modulates the spring constants. We analytically compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix for both periodic and fixed boundary conditions, and compare them with the dispersion spectrum of the original tight-binding SSH model. We observe the presence of a topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phase within a specific range of quasi-periodic modulation strength and calculate the phase transition boundary analytically. We examine the localization properties of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenstates of the dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fractal dimension associated with quasiperiodic modulation. We also examine the stability of the TAI phase across a range of modulation strengths and comments on the presence of mobility edge that separate localized modes from non-localized ones. We demonstrate the fact that special analytical techniques are needed to compute an exact expression for mobility edges in such scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an action of the Weyl group W of a simple Lie algebra g on a completion of the ring Y, which is the codomain of the q-character homomorphism of the corresponding quantum affine algebra U_q(g^). We prove that the subring of W-invariants of Y is precisely the ring of q-characters, which is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category of finite-dimensional representations of U_q(g^). This resolves an old puzzle in the theory of q-characters. We also identify the screening operators, which were previously used to describe the ring of q-characters, as the subleading terms of simple reflections from W in a certain limit. Our results have already found applications to the study of the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of U_q(g^) in arXiv:2312.13256 and to the categorification of cluster algebras in arXiv:2401.04616.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the spatial structure of quantum correlations in materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are a fundamental property of quantum many-body states. Yet they remain experimentally elusive, hindering certification of genuine quantum behavior, especially in quantum materials. Here we show that the momentum-dependent dynamical susceptibility measured via inelastic neutron scattering enables the systematic reconstruction of a general family of quantum correlation functions, which express the degree of quantum coherence in the fluctuations of two spins at arbitrary mutual distance. Using neutron scattering data on the compound KCuF$_3$ $\unicode{x2014}$ a system of weakly coupled $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chains $\unicode{x2014}$ and of numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo data, we show that quantum correlations possess a radically different spatial structure with respect to conventional correlations. Indeed, they exhibit a new emergent length scale $\unicode{x2014}$ the quantum coherence length $\unicode{x2014}$ which is finite at any finite temperature (including when long-range magnetic order develops). Moreover, we show theoretically that coupled Heisenberg spin chains exhibit a form of quantum monogamy, with a trade-off between quantum correlations along and transverse to the spin chains. These results highlight real-space quantum correlators as an informative, model-independent means of probing the underlying quantum state of real quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Designs via Free Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary Designs have become a vital tool for investigating pseudorandomness since they approximate the statistics of the uniform Haar ensemble. Despite their central role in quantum information, their relation to quantum chaotic evolution and in particular to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) are still largely debated issues. This work provides a bridge between the latter and $k$-designs through Free Probability theory. First, by introducing the more general notion of $k$-freeness, we show that it can be used as an alternative probe to designs. In turn, free probability theory comes with several tools, useful for instance for the calculation of mixed moments or the so-called $k$-fold quantum channels. Our second result is the connection to quantum dynamics. Quantum ergodicity, and correspondingly ETH, apply to a restricted class of physical observables, as already discussed in the literature. In this spirit, we show that unitary evolution with generic Hamiltonians always leads to freeness at sufficiently long times, but only when the operators considered are restricted within the ETH class. Our results provide a direct link between unitary designs, quantum chaos and the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, and shed new light on the universality of late-time quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 2+1 dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary numerical evidence for the hypothesis that the Hamiltonian SU(2) gauge theory discretized on a lattice obeys the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). To do so we study three approximations: (a) a linear plaquette chain in a reduced Hilbert space limiting the electric field basis to $j=0,\frac{1}{2}$ , (b) a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with periodic or closed boundary condition and the same Hilbert space constraint, and (c) a chain of only three plaquettes but such a sufficiently large electric field Hilbert space ($j \leq \frac{7}{2})$ that convergence of all energy eigenvalues in the analyzed energy window is observed. While an unconstrained Hilbert space is required to reach the continuum limit of SU(2) gauge theory, numerical resource constraints do not permit us to realize this requirement for all values of the coupling constant and large lattices. In each of the three studied cases we check first for random matrix theory (RMT) behavior in the eigenenergy spectrum and then analyze the diagonal as well as the off-diagonal matrix elements between energy eigenstates for a few operators. Within current uncertainties all results for (a), (b) and (c) agree with ETH predictions. Furthermore, we find the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric energy operator exhibit RMT behavior in frequency windows that are small enough in (b) and (c). To unambiguously establish ETH behavior and determine for which class of operators it applies, an extension of our investigations is necessary.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in the mesoscopic-leads formulation of quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entropy production of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths is a core problem of both quantum thermodynamics and mesoscopic physics. While there exist many techniques to accurately study entropy production in such systems, they typically require a microscopic description of the baths, which can become numerically intractable to study for large systems. Alternatively an open-systems approach can be employed with all the nuances associated with various levels of approximation. Recently, the mesoscopic leads approach has emerged as a powerful method for studying such quantum systems strongly coupled to multiple thermal baths. In this method, a set of discretised lead modes, each locally damped, provide a Markovian embedding. Here we show that this method proves extremely useful to describe entropy production of a strongly coupled open quantum system. We show numerically, for both non-interacting and interacting setups, that a system coupled to a single bath exhibits a thermal fixed point at the level of the embedding. This allows us to use various results from the thermodynamics of quantum dynamical semi-groups to infer the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the strongly coupled, non-Markovian central systems. In particular, we show that the entropy production in the transient regime recovers the well established microscopic definitions of entropy production with a correction that can be computed explicitly for both the single- and multiple-lead cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>
