      <title>Prediction Sets and Conformal Inference with Censored Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given data on a scalar random variable $Y$, a prediction set for $Y$ with miscoverage level $\alpha$ is a set of values for $Y$ that contains a randomly drawn $Y$ with probability $1 - \alpha$, where $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Among all prediction sets that satisfy this coverage property, the oracle prediction set is the one with the smallest volume. This paper provides estimation methods of such prediction sets given observed conditioning covariates when $Y$ is censored or measured in intervals. We first characterise the oracle prediction set under interval censoring and develop a consistent estimator for the shortest prediction interval that satisfies this coverage property. We then extend these consistency results to accommodate cases where the prediction set consists of multiple disjoint intervals. Second, we use conformal inference to construct a prediction set that achieves a particular notion of finite-sample validity under censoring and maintains consistency as sample size increases. This notion exploits exchangeability to obtain finite sample guarantees on coverage using a specially constructed conformity score function. The procedure accomodates the prediction uncertainty that is irreducible (due to the stochastic nature of outcomes), the modelling uncertainty due to partial identification and also sampling uncertainty that gets reduced as samples get larger. We conduct a set of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to data from the Current Population Survey. The results highlight the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The Causal Impact of Dean's List Recognition on Academic Performance: Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the causal impact of being placed on the Dean's List, a positive education incentive, on future student performance using a regression discontinuity design. The results suggest that for students with low prior academic performance and who are native English speakers, there is a positive impact of being on the Dean's List on the probability of getting onto the Dean's List in the following year. However, being on the Dean's List does not appear to have a statistically significant effect on subsequent GPA, total credits taken, dropout rates, or the probability of graduating within four years. These findings suggest that a place on the Dean's List may not be a strong motivator for students to improve their academic performance and achieve better outcomes.</description>

      <title>Testing identifying assumptions in Tobit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops sharp testable implications for Tobit and IV-Tobit models' identifying assumptions: linear index specification, (joint) normality of latent errors, and treatment (instrument) exogeneity and relevance. The new sharp testable equalities can detect all possible observable violations of the identifying conditions. We propose a testing procedure for the model's validity using existing inference methods for intersection bounds. Simulation results suggests proper size for large samples and that the test is powerful to detect large violation of the exogeneity assumption and violations in the error structure. Finally, we review and propose new alternative paths to partially identify the parameters of interest under less restrictive assumptions.</description>

      <title>Comparing hundreds of machine learning classifiers and discrete choice models in predicting travel behavior: an empirical benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have compared machine learning (ML) and discrete choice models (DCMs) in predicting travel demand. However, these studies often lack generalizability as they compare models deterministically without considering contextual variations. To address this limitation, our study develops an empirical benchmark by designing a tournament model, thus efficiently summarizing a large number of experiments, quantifying the randomness in model comparisons, and using formal statistical tests to differentiate between the model and contextual effects. This benchmark study compares two large-scale data sources: a database compiled from literature review summarizing 136 experiments from 35 studies, and our own experiment data, encompassing a total of 6,970 experiments from 105 models and 12 model families. This benchmark study yields two key findings. Firstly, many ML models, particularly the ensemble methods and deep learning, statistically outperform the DCM family (i.e., multinomial, nested, and mixed logit models). However, this study also highlights the crucial role of the contextual factors (i.e., data sources, inputs and choice categories), which can explain models' predictive performance more effectively than the differences in model types alone. Model performance varies significantly with data sources, improving with larger sample sizes and lower dimensional alternative sets. After controlling all the model and contextual factors, significant randomness still remains, implying inherent uncertainty in such model comparisons. Overall, we suggest that future researchers shift more focus from context-specific model comparisons towards examining model transferability across contexts and characterizing the inherent uncertainty in ML, thus creating more robust and generalizable next-generation travel demand models.</description>
