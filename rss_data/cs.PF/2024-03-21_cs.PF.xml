      <title>Starlink on the Road: A First Look at Mobile Starlink Performance in Central Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks such as Starlink promise to provide world-wide Internet access. While traditionally designed for stationary use, a new dish, released in April 2023 in Europe, provides mobile Internet access including in-motion usage, e.g., while mounted on a car. In this paper, we design and build a mobile measurement setup. Our goal is to fully autonomously conduct continuous Starlink measurements while the car is in motion. We share our practical experiences, including challenges regarding the permanent power supply. We measure the Starlink performance over the span of two months from mid-January to mid-March 2024 when the car is in motion. The measurements consist of all relevant network parameters, such as the download and upload throughput, the RTT, and packet loss, as well as detailed power consumption data. We analyze our dataset to assess Starlink's mobile performance in Central Europe, Germany, and compare it to stationary measurements in proximity. We find that the mobile performance is significantly worse than stationary performance. The power consumption of the new dish is higher, but seems to be more correlated to the heating function of the dish than to the speed of the vehicle.</description>

      <title>Network Calculus Bounds for Time-Sensitive Networks: A Revisit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network calculus (NC), particularly its min-plus branch, has been extensively utilized to construct service models and compute delay bounds for time-sensitive networks (TSNs). This paper provides a revisit to the fundamental results. In particular, counterexamples to the most basic min-plus service models, which have been proposed for TSNs and used for computing delay bounds, indicate that the packetization effect has often been overlooked. To address, the max-plus branch of NC is also considered in this paper, whose models handle packetized traffic more explicitly. It is found that mapping the min-plus models to the max-plus models may bring in an immediate improvement over delay bounds derived from the min-plus analysis. In addition, an integrated analytical approach that combines models from both the min-plus and the max-plus NC branches is introduced. In this approach, the max-plus $g$-server model is extended and the extended model, called $g^{x}$-server, is used together with the min-plus arrival curve traffic model. By applying the integrated NC approach, service and delay bounds are derived for several settings that are fundamental in TSNs.</description>
