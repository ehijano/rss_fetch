      <title>Relay synchronization and control of dynamics in multiplex networks with unidirectional inter layer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplex networks provide a proper framework for understanding the dynamics of complex systems with different types of interactions. In this study, we consider the occurrence of different dynamical states in a multiplex network of nonlinear oscillators, with a drive layer and two identical response layers where the inter layer interactions are unidirectional. We report how the directionality in coupling can lead to relay synchronization with amplification in the two response layers, through the middle drive layer. Moreover, we find that the dynamics of the response layers can be controlled by adjusting the strength of inter layer coupling or tuning the dynamical time scale of the drive layer. With nonidentical parameters between the drive and response layers, the response layers get completely synchronized, with a functional relation with the drive, indicating generalized synchronization between the drive and response networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bias of collective oscillation frequency induced by asymmetric Cauchy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the effect of nonlinear bias of the frequency of collective oscillations of sin-coupled phase oscillators subject to individual asymmetric Cauchy noises. The noise asymmetry makes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz inapplicable. We argue that, for all stable non-Gaussian noises, the tail asymmetry is not only possible (in addition to the trivial shift of the distribution median) but also generic in many physical and biophysical set-ups. For the theoretical description of the effect, we develop a mathematical formalism based on the circular cumulants. The derivation of rigorous asymptotic results can be performed on this basis but seems infeasible in traditional terms of the circular moments (the Kuramoto-Daido order parameters). The effect of the entrainment of individual oscillator frequencies by the global oscillations is also reported in detail. The accuracy of theoretical results based on the low dimensional circular cumulant reductions is validated with the high-accuracy "exact" solutions calculated with the continued fraction method.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Shear-Thinning Rheology on the Dynamics and Pressure Distribution of a Single Rigid Ellipsoidal Particle in Viscous Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the behavior of a single rigid ellipsoidal particle suspended in homogenous viscous flow with a power-law Generalized Newtonian Fluid (GNF) rheology using a custom-built finite element analysis (FEA) simulation. The combined effects of the shear-thinning fluid rheology, the particle aspect ratio, the initial particle orientation and the shear-extensional rate factor in various homogenous flow regimes on the particle's dynamics and surface pressure evolution are investigated. The shear-thinning fluid behavior was found to modify the particle's trajectory and alter the particle's kinematic response. Moreover, the pressure distribution over the particle's surface is significantly reduced by the shear-thinning fluid rheology. The FEA model is validated by comparing results of the Newtonian case with results obtained from the well-known Jefferys analytical model. Furthermore, Jefferys model is extended to define the particle's trajectory in a special class of homogenous Newtonian flows with combined extension and shear rate components typically found in axisymmetric nozzle flow contractions. The findings provide an improved understanding of key transport phenomenon related to physical processes involving fluid-structure interaction (FSI) such as that which occurs within the flow-field developed during material extrusion-deposition additive manufacturing of fiber reinforced polymeric composites. These results provide insight into important microstructural formations within the print beads.</description>

      <title>The clock advance description of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we propose to extend the ETAS model to micro-seismic events. For that we interpret the triggered events in an ETAS model as individual local clock advances of an independent background process. The solution of the ETAS model thus becomes the sum of an infinite Markov chain of independent time adjusted background processses. This allows the incorporation of events at all scales. No artificial small magnitude cutoff is needed.</description>
