      <title>Healing Gradient Degradation in Nb3Sn SRF Cavities Using a Recoating Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite having advantageous superconducting properties, Nb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities still have practical challenges compared to Nb SRF cavities due to the brittle nature of Nb3Sn. Performance degradation can occur when a Nb3Sn SRF cavity experiences mechanical stresses such as during handling and tuning of the cavity. In this study, we present a potential treatment for SRF cavities that have experienced stress induced performance degradation that involves a recoating procedure. The degraded cavity is coated with a small amount of Sn using a single step vapor-diffusion methodology. Using this approach we can recover a significant portion of the lost performance of a Nb3Sn SRF cavity.</description>

      <title>Flexible multi-bunch-length operation for continuous-wave x-ray free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) are cutting-edge instruments pivotal in a broad range of fields, providing high-power X-ray pulses with durations spanning from femtoseconds to attoseconds. One of the critical challenges in XFEL facilities is the simultaneous accommodation of diverse requirements for XFEL operation modes and photon properties across different undulator lines. This paper proposes a dipole-kicker combination in the bunch compressors to vary the electron bunch length for the continuous-wave XFEL facilities driven by a superconducting linac. This method enables optimization of the electron bunch length on a per-bunch basis, tailored to each specific needs of each undulator. Through start-to-end simulations based on the parameters of the Shanghai high-repetition-rate XFEL and extreme light facility, we demonstrate the feasibility of this technique. The results show its effectiveness in enabling simultaneous operations of self-amplified spontaneous emission and externally seeded FEL across different undulator lines, ensuring optimal electron bunch compression for each undulator line.</description>

      <title>From Compton Scattering of photons on targets to Inverse Compton Scattering of electron and photon beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the kinematics of Compton Scattering (electron-photon interactions producing electrons and photons in the exit channel) covering the full range of energy/momenta distribution between the two colliding particles, with a dedicated view to statistical properties of secondary beams that are generated in beam-beam collisions. Starting from the Thomson inverse scattering, where electrons do not recoil and photons are back-scattered to higher energies by a Lorentz boost effect (factor $4\gamma^2$), we analyze three transition points, separating four regions. These are in sequence, given by increasing the electron recoil (numbers are for transition points, letters for regions): a) Thomson back-scattering, 1) equal sharing of total energy in the exit channel between electron and photon, b) deep recoil regime where the bandwidth/energy spread of the two interacting beams are exchanged in the exit channel, 2) electron is stopped, i.e. taken down at rest in the laboratory system by colliding with an incident photon of $mc^2/2$ energy, c) electron back-scattering region, where incident electron is back-scattered by the incident photon, 3) symmetric scattering, when the incident particles carry equal and opposite momenta, so that in the exit channel they are back-scattered with same energy/momenta, d) Compton scattering ($a'$ $la$ Arthur Compton, see ref.4), where photons carry an energy much larger than the colliding electron energy. For each region and/or transition point we discuss the potential effects of interest in diverse areas, like generating mono-chromatic gamma ray beams in deep recoil regions with spectral purification, or possible mechanisms of generation and propagation of very high energy photons in the cosmological domain.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Irradiation Behavior of Dual Phases in Ti-6Al-4V Alloy at Low-Temperature Due to Omega-phase Precursors in Beta-phase Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming to simulate the radiation damage effect on a dual alpha+beta phase Ti-6Al-4V alloy utilized as high-intensity accelerator beam window material, a series of irradiation experiments were conducted with a 2.8 MeV-Fe^2+ ion beam in several dpa regions at room temperature. The nano-indentation hardness increased steeply at 1 dpa and unchanged up to 10 dpa, due to the saturation of defect clusters and tangled dislocations in the dominant alpha-phase matrix with a size of 2~3 nm and a density of about 1x10^23 m^-3. In contrast in the intergranular beta-phase, larger loops of 20~30 nm diameter were observed with much less density of about 5x10^20 m^-3. The diffraction pattern showed rectilinear diffuse streaks between the beta-phase reflections, corresponding to the omega-phase precursor, without dose dependency in its intensity. FFT/I-FFT analysis of the HREM revealed a sub-nanometer-sized lattice disorder with local fluctuations, not discrete but continuous, and homogeneously distributed within the matrix beta-phase stably against the irradiation. The significantly low dislocation density and the absence of phase transformation in the beta-phase matrix could be attributed either to the strong sink effect expected for this distinctive sub-nanometer-sized homogeneous lattice disorder or to the anomalous point defect recombination induced by the high mobility of vacancies, both of which are originated from the metastable omega-phase precursors specifically formed in the beta(BCC) phase of group-4 transition metals.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Particle-in-Cell Simulations Through Learning and GPU Computing for Hybrid Particle Accelerator Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle accelerator modeling is an important field of research and development, essential to investigating, designing and operating some of the most complex scientific devices ever built. Kinetic simulations of relativistic, charged particle beams and advanced plasma accelerator elements are often performed with high-fidelity particle-in-cell simulations, some of which fill the largest GPU supercomputers. Start-to-end modeling of a particle accelerator includes many elements and it is desirable to integrate and model advanced accelerator elements fast, in effective models. Traditionally, analytical and reduced-physics models fill this role. The vast data from high-fidelity simulations and power of GPU-accelerated computation open a new opportunity to complement traditional modeling without approximations: surrogate modeling through machine learning. In this paper, we implement, present and benchmark such a data-driven workflow, synthesising a fully GPU-accelerated, conventional-surrogate simulation for hybrid particle accelerator beamlines.</description>
