      <title>Automated Glaucoma Report Generation via Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM and Multimodal Clinical Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI for automated glaucoma diagnostic report generation faces two predominant challenges: content redundancy in narrative outputs and inadequate highlighting of pathologically significant features including optic disc cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer defects, and visual field abnormalities. These limitations primarily stem from current multimodal architectures' insufficient capacity to extract discriminative structural-textural patterns from fundus imaging data while maintaining precise semantic alignment with domain-specific terminology in comprehensive clinical reports. To overcome these constraints, we present the Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM Network (DA-SPL), an advanced multimodal generation framework that synergistically processes both fundus imaging and supplementary visual inputs. DA-SPL employs an Encoder-Decoder structure augmented with the novel joint dual-attention mechanism in the encoder for cross-modal feature refinement, the parallelized LSTM decoder architecture for enhanced temporal-semantic consistency, and the specialized label enhancement module for accurate disease-relevant term generation. Rigorous evaluation on standard glaucoma datasets demonstrates DA-SPL's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models across quantitative metrics. DA-SPL exhibits exceptional capability in extracting subtle pathological indicators from multimodal inputs while generating diagnostically precise reports that exhibit strong concordance with clinical expert annotations.</description>

      <title>GrifFinNet: A Graph-Relation Integrated Transformer for Financial Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting stock returns remains a central challenge in quantitative finance, transitioning from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep learning techniques. However, many current models struggle with effectively capturing spatio-temporal dynamics and integrating multiple relational data sources. This study proposes GrifFinNet, a Graph-Relation Integrated Transformer for Financial Predictions, which combines multi-relational graph modeling with Transformer-based temporal encoding. GrifFinNet constructs inter-stock relation graphs based on industry sectors and institutional ownership, and incorporates an adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically integrate relational data in response to changing market conditions. This approach enables the model to jointly capture spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, offering a comprehensive representation of market dynamics. Extensive experiments on two Chinese A-share indices show that GrifFinNet consistently outperforms several baseline models and provides valuable, interpretable insights into financial market behavior.

      <title>Parameterized crack modelling based on a localized non-intrusive reduced basis method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents a model order reduction strategy for fast parametric modelling of problems with cracks formulated on spline discretizations. In the context of damage detection, parametric reduced order models (ROMs) are well suited for fast computations by establishing an efficient offline/online split of the simulation process. The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost. We demonstrate the applicability of the ROM approach with benchmark tests on linear elastic problems discretized with splines and the extended isogeometric method (XIGA) for crack modelling. The results we obtain show the accuracy and real-time efficiency of the constructed reduced order models.</description>

      <title>Influence of coronary plaque morphology on local mechanical states and associated in-stent restenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention is a multifactorial process. Specific morphological lesion characteristics were observed to contribute to the occurrence of in-stent restenosis. Local mechanical factors, such as stresses and strains, are known to influence tissue adaptation after stent implantation. However, the influence of morphological features on those local mechanical states and, hence, on the occurrence of in-stent restenosis remains understudied. This work investigates the correlation between local mechanical quantities and in-stent restenosis by evaluating the stress distributions in the artery wall during and after stent implantation for informative lesion morphologies. We perform computational simulations of the stenting procedure with physics-based patient-specific coronary artery models. Different morphologies are assessed using the spatial plaque composition information from high-resolution coronary computed tomography angiography data. We quantify the correlation between in-stent restenosis and local tensional stresses. We found that specific morphological characteristics like circumferential or asymmetric block calcifications result in higher stresses in the surrounding tissue. This study concludes that local stresses are critical for assessing the individual in-stent restenosis risk.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Earth-Observing Satellite Sampling Effectiveness Using Kullback-Leibler Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an objective, repeatable, automatic, and fast methodology for assessing the representativeness of geophysical variables sampled by Earth-observing satellites. The primary goal is to identify and mitigate potential sampling biases attributed to orbit selection during pre-Phase A mission studies. This methodology supports current incubation activities for a future Planetary Boundary Layer observing system by incorporating a sampling effectiveness measure into a broader architectural study. The study evaluates the effectiveness of 20 satellite configurations for observing convective storm activity in the Southwestern U.S. during the North American Monsoon (NAM) season. The primary design variables are the number of satellites, orbit type (sun-synchronous or inclined), and Local Time of Ascending Node (LTAN). Using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to assess observational representativeness and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate probability density functions, the study quantifies the discrepancy between observed and ground truth storm features. Results indicate that a two-satellite sun-synchronous system with an 8:00 PM LTAN, achieved the lowest KL divergence, signifying the most representative observation of storm clusters. In contrast, single-satellite configurations, particularly those with late-night LTANs (e.g., 12:00 AM), demonstrated significantly higher KL divergence. The study concludes that dual-satellite configurations in sun-synchronous orbits with evening LTANs outperform single-satellite and inclined configurations in capturing representative convective storm activity.

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Neural Network Architectures for Generalizable Human Spatial Preference Prediction in Unseen Built Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Physics-Enhanced Bayesian Inverse Analysis: Information Gain from Additional Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world inverse problems suffer from limited data, often because they rely on measurements of a single physical field. Such data frequently fail to sufficiently reduce parameter uncertainty in Bayesian inverse analysis. Incorporating easily available data from additional physical fields can substantially decrease this uncertainty. We focus on Bayesian inverse analyses based on computational models, e.g., those using the finite element method. To incorporate data from additional physical fields, the computational model must be extended to include these fields. While this model extension may have little to no effect on forward model predictions, it can greatly enhance inverse analysis by leveraging the multi-physics data. Our work proposes this multi-physics-enhanced inverse approach and demonstrates its potential using two models: a simple model with one-way coupled fields and a complex computational model with fully coupled fields. We quantify the uncertainty reduction by comparing the effect of single-physics and multi-physics data on the information gain from the prior to the posterior. Our results show that even a few or noisy data points from an additional physical field can considerably increase the information gain, even if this field is weakly or one-way coupled. Although multi-physics data are often readily available, it is remarkable that their potential has been largely neglected in model calibration so far. Instead, costly and time-consuming additional experimental setups are often pursued. In contrast, incorporating multi-physics data requires minimal effort when multi-physics models are readily available or easy to implement, as is the case with uncoupled and one-way coupled models. This work proposes and promotes the future use of multi-physics-enhanced Bayesian inverse analysis as a cost- and time-saving game-changer across various fields of science and industry.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for pricing perishable goods for quick-commerce applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quick commerce (q-commerce) is one of the fastest growing sectors in India. It provides informal employment to approximately 4,50,000 workers, and it is estimated to become a USD 200 Billion industry by 2026. A significant portion of this industry deals with perishable goods. (e.g. milk, dosa batter etc.) These are food items which are consumed relatively fresh by the consumers and therefore their order volume is high and repetitive even when the average basket size is relatively small. The fundamental challenge for the retailer is that, increasing selling price would hamper sales and would lead to unsold inventory. On the other hand setting a price less, would lead to forgoing of potential revenue. This paper attempts to propose a mathematical model which formalizes this dilemma. The problem statement is not only important for improving the unit economics of the perennially loss making quick commerce firms, but also would lead to a trickle-down effect in improving the conditions of the gig workers as observed in [4]. The sections below describe the mathematical formulation. The results from the simulation would be published in a follow-up study.</description>

      <title>LRQ-Solver: A Transformer-Based Neural Operator for Fast and Accurate Solving of Large-scale 3D PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on complex three-dimensional geometries represents a central challenge in scientific and engineering computing, often impeded by expensive pre-processing stages and substantial computational overhead. We introduce Low-Rank Query-based PDE Solver (LRQ-Solver), a physics-integrated framework engineered for rapid, accurate, and highly scalable simulations of industrial-grade models. This framework is built upon two primary technical innovations. First, our Parameter Conditioned Lagrangian Modeling (PCLM) approach explicitly couples local physical states with global design parameters, enabling robust predictions across varied simulation configurations. By embedding physical consistency directly into the learning architecture, PCLM ensures that predictions remain physically meaningful even under unseen design conditions, significantly enhancing generalization and reliability. Second, the Low-Rank Query Attention (LR-QA) module leverages the second-order statistics of physical fields to construct a global coherence kernel, reducing the computational complexity of attention from O(N2) to O(NC2 + C3). By replacing point-wise clustering with covariance decomposition, LRQ-Solver achieves exceptional scalability efficiently processing up to 2 million points on a single GPU. Validated on standard benchmarks, LRQ-Solver achieves a 38.9% error reduction on the DrivAer++ dataset and 28.76% on the 3D Beam dataset, alongside a training speedup of up to 50 times. Our results establish that LRQ-Solver offers a powerful paradigm for multi-configuration physics simulations, delivering a SOTA combination of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. Code to reproduce the experiments is available at https://github.com/LilaKen/LRQ-Solver.</description>

      <title>On the Relationship between Space-Time Accessibility and Leisure Activity Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines. In this study, we introduce a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes, and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Spatial patterns show that most individuals-especially active transport users-choose destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling reveals that SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity. These findings highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in social life across diverse population groups.</description>

      <title>Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation. TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition, reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods plateau early under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Quantifying Financial Bubbles with the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model, the Hyped Log-Periodic Power Law Model (HLPPL), to the problem of quantifying and detecting financial bubbles, an ever-fascinating one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility. Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a feature which is especially beneficial for market signaling and decision-making. Overall, this approach utilizes both theoretical and empirical advances for real-time positive and negative bubble identification and measurement with HLPPL signals.</description>

      <title>Automating Structural Engineering Workflows with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization -- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in practical engineering scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hot-Starting Quantum Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization with a smooth and convex objective function arises naturally in applications such as discrete mean-variance portfolio optimization, where assets must be traded in integer quantities. Although optimal solutions to the associated smooth problem can be computed efficiently, existing adiabatic quantum optimization methods cannot leverage this information. Moreover, while various warm-starting strategies have been proposed for gate-based quantum optimization, none of them explicitly integrate insights from the relaxed continuous solution into the QUBO formulation. In this work, a novel approach is introduced that restricts the search space to discrete solutions in the vicinity of the continuous optimum by constructing a compact Hilbert space, thereby reducing the number of required qubits. Experiments on software solvers and a D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Discontinuous Galerkin Splitting Schemes for Fluids with Variable Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates matrix-free higher-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the Navier--Stokes equations for incompressible flows with variable viscosity. The viscosity field may be prescribed analytically or governed by a rheological law, as often found in biomedical or industrial applications. The DG discretization of the adapted second-order viscous terms is carried out via the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method, obviating auxiliary variables. Based on this spatial discretization, we compare several linearized variants of saddle point block systems and projection-based splitting time integration schemes in terms of their computational performance. Compared to the velocity-pressure block-system for the former, the splitting scheme allows solving a sequence of simple problems such as mass, convection-diffusion and Poisson equations. We investigate under which conditions the improved temporal stability of fully implicit schemes and resulting expensive nonlinear solves outperform the splitting schemes and linearized variants that are stable under hyperbolic time step restrictions.
  The key aspects of this work are i) a higher-order DG discretization for incompressible flows with variable viscosity, ii) accelerated nonlinear solver variants and suitable linearizations adopting a matrix-free $hp$-multigrid solver, and iii) a detailed comparison of the monolithic and projection-based solvers in terms of their (non-)linear solver performance.
  The presented schemes are evaluated in a series of numerical examples verifying their spatial and temporal accuracy, and the preconditioner performance under increasing viscosity contrasts, while their efficiency is showcased in the backward-facing step benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Fueled Modelfluid for Flowsheet Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process optimization in chemical engineering may be hindered by the limited availability of reliable thermodynamic data for fluid mixtures. Remarkable progress is being made in predicting thermodynamic mixture properties by machine learning techniques. The vast information provided by these prediction methods enables new possibilities in process optimization. This work introduces a novel modelfluid representation that is designed to seamlessly integrate these ML-predicted data directly into flowsheet optimization. Tailored for distillation, our approach is built on physically interpretable and continuous features derived from core vapor liquid equilibrium phenomena. This ensures compatibility with existing simulation tools and gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the power and accuracy of this ML-fueled modelfluid by applying it to the problem of entrainer selection for an azeotropic separation. The results show that our framework successfully identifies optimal, thermodynamically consistent entrainers with high fidelity compared to conventional models. Ultimately, this work provides a practical pathway to incorporate large-scale property prediction into efficient process design and optimization, overcoming the limitations of both traditional thermodynamic models and complex molecular-based equations of state.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive comparison of neural operators for 3D industry-scale engineering designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning nonlinear mappings between function spaces, enabling real-time prediction of complex dynamics in diverse scientific and engineering applications. With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.</description>

      <title>AbBiBench: A Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1. We sample new antibody variants with the top-performing models, rank them by the structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex, and assess them with in vitro ELISA binding assays. Our findings show that structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz Scheme for Linear-Quadratic Programs in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimize-then-discretize framework for solving linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCP) governed by time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our method employs a modified overlapping Schwarz decomposition based on the Pontryagin Minimum Principle, partitioning the temporal domain into overlapping intervals and independently solving Hamiltonian systems in continuous time. We demonstrate that the convergence is ensured by appropriately updating the boundary conditions of the individual Hamiltonian dynamics. The cornerstone of our analysis is to prove that the exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS) exhibited in discrete-time OCPs carries over to the continuous-time setting. Unlike the discretize-then-optimize approach, our method can flexibly incorporate different numerical integration methods for solving the resulting Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value subproblems, including adaptive-time integrators. A numerical experiment on a linear-quadratic OCP illustrates the practicality of our approach in broad scientific applications.</description>
