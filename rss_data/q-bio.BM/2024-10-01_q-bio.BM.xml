      <title>Generalized Protein Pocket Generation with Prior-Informed Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing ligand-binding proteins, such as enzymes and biosensors, is essential in bioengineering and protein biology. One critical step in this process involves designing protein pockets, the protein interface binding with the ligand. Current approaches to pocket generation often suffer from time-intensive physical computations or template-based methods, as well as compromised generation quality due to the overlooking of domain knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose PocketFlow, a generative model that incorporates protein-ligand interaction priors based on flow matching. During training, PocketFlow learns to model key types of protein-ligand interactions, such as hydrogen bonds. In the sampling, PocketFlow leverages multi-granularity guidance (overall binding affinity and interaction geometry constraints) to facilitate generating high-affinity and valid pockets. Extensive experiments show that PocketFlow outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks, e.g., achieving an average improvement of 1.29 in Vina Score and 0.05 in scRMSD. Moreover, modeling interactions make PocketFlow a generalized generative model across multiple ligand modalities, including small molecules, peptides, and RNA.</description>

      <title>FlexSBDD: Structure-Based Drug Design with Flexible Protein Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which aims to generate 3D ligand molecules binding to target proteins, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Existing SBDD methods typically treat protein as rigid and neglect protein structural change when binding with ligand molecules, leading to a big gap with real-world scenarios and inferior generation qualities (e.g., many steric clashes). To bridge the gap, we propose FlexSBDD, a deep generative model capable of accurately modeling the flexible protein-ligand complex structure for ligand molecule generation. FlexSBDD adopts an efficient flow matching framework and leverages E(3)-equivariant network with scalar-vector dual representation to model dynamic structural changes. Moreover, novel data augmentation schemes based on structure relaxation/sidechain repacking are adopted to boost performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexSBDD achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity molecules and effectively modeling the protein's conformation change to increase favorable protein-ligand interactions (e.g., Hydrogen bonds) and decrease steric clashes.</description>

      <title>Assessing interaction recovery of predicted protein-ligand poses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of protein-ligand pose prediction has seen significant advances in recent years, with machine learning-based methods now being commonly used in lieu of classical docking methods or even to predict all-atom protein-ligand complex structures. Most contemporary studies focus on the accuracy and physical plausibility of ligand placement to determine pose quality, often neglecting a direct assessment of the interactions observed with the protein. In this work, we demonstrate that ignoring protein-ligand interaction fingerprints can lead to overestimation of model performance, most notably in recent protein-ligand cofolding models which often fail to recapitulate key interactions.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Constrained Nucleus-Level Denoising Diffusion Model for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving binding affinities.</description>
