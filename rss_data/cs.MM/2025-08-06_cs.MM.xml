      <title>LUST: A Multi-Modal Framework with Hierarchical LLM-based Scoring for Learned Thematic Significance Tracking in Multimedia Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.</description>

      <title>Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training, offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages, developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information. Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving industrial needs.</description>

      <title>Privileged Contrastive Pretraining for Multimodal Affect Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and practical solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives, while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically, GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally, the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>LayerT2V: Interactive Multi-Object Trajectory Layering for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

      <title>I$^3$-MRec: Invariant Learning with Information Bottleneck for Incomplete Modality Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due to missing images, incomplete descriptions, or inconsistent user content. These challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization capabilities of current models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective modality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information while maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item embeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference signals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. The code and processed datasets are released at https://github.com/HuilinChenJN/I3-MRec.</description>

      <title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Leaderboard: Rethinking Medical Benchmarks for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.</description>

      <title>CLASP: Cross-modal Salient Anchor-based Semantic Propagation for Weakly-supervised Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors}, which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an \textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>SEAgent: Self-Evolving Computer Use Agent with Autonomous Learning from Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.</description>

      <title>Iola Walker: A Mobile Footfall Detection System for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is part of a larger music technology research project. http://willbjames.github.io The goal of this research is to find a method of materially enhancing music using hardware and software. Why might one want to do this, you might ask? Because if it was possible to create a new form of music that was preferred by listeners, that would be a great way for musicians to reclaim live musical performance from the digital advertising industry. This project is an initial iteration towards the broader research goal of promoting equitable human thriving in the music field. \par The project is dubbed "iola walker" in reference to a common polyrhythm, the hemiola. A listener goes for a walk, and the Iola Walker app detects their walking pace. Iola Walker picks up footfalls using a foot-mounted accelerometer, processing the signals in real time using a recurrent neural network in an android app. The android app outputs a midi event for each footfall. The iola walker player plays the version of the next music passage with underlying polyrhythms closest to the listener's walking pace, as determined by the composer. \par This paper documents the process of training the model to detect a walking listener's footfalls in real time. The model is trained on accelerometer data from an Mbient Labs foot-mounted IMU \cite{mbientlabs} at 200~Hz, with the ground truth for footfalls annotated by pressing the volume up button on the android device when the foot hits the ground. To collect training data, I walked around my neighborhood clicking the volume up button each time my foot hit the ground. I tried several methods for detecting footfalls in real time from sensor data, with the most success from an LSTM.

      <title>Can Sound Replace Vision in LLaVA With Token Substitution?</title>

Abstract: What happens when we push audio-visual alignment to its absolute limits? To systematically investigate this question, we needed datasets with granular alignment quality annotations, but existing datasets treat alignment as binary, either synchronized or not. To address this limitation, we developed a comprehensive dataset featuring detailed alignment scores that reveal the hidden spectrum of audio-visual perceptual correspondence. Using these precise scores, we create "superaligned" representations by training exclusively on the most perfectly matched audio-visual pairs, then conduct our systematic investigation into how this extreme alignment transforms perceptual model behavior across retrieval and generation tasks. The encoders under study fall into two main groups consisting of image-centric encoders that were pretrained using visual modalities as intermediary hubs for connecting modalities, and text-centric encoders that were pretrained with direct audio-language alignment. We first measure the baseline performance of these encoders on two key tasks, namely cross-modal retrieval and text description generation in vision-language models. Subsequently, we realign all encoders with the CLIP space using highly coherent audio-visual data and observe the performance changes. Our findings reveal that the initial architectural type of the encoder determines how it responds to the alignment process. Image-centric encoders, which are inherently designed for alignment, demonstrate exceptional performance in cross-modal retrieval, but this intensive alignment causes compression of unique linguistic information and reduces the quality of their text description generation in vision-language models. In contrast, text-centric encoders, which possess stronger linguistic authenticity, are able to maintain a better balance between the two objectives.</description>

      <title>RoboTron-Drive: All-in-One Large Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose RoboTron-Drive, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD datasets to finetune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on three unseen datasets, where RoboTron-Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope RoboTron-Drive as a promising solution for AD in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/RoboTron-Drive.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages audio and visual modalities to improve robustness in noisy environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, the long speech representations lead to high computational costs for LLMs. Prior methods compress inputs before feeding them to LLMs, but high compression often harms accuracy. To address this, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which flexibly adapts audio-visual token allocation under varying compute constraints. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, our model encodes representations at multiple granularities with a single architecture, avoiding the need for separate models. For efficient fine-tuning, we introduce three LoRA-based strategies using global and scale-specific modules. Evaluations on major AVSR datasets show Llama-MTSK matches or outperforms models trained at fixed compression levels.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Multi-Task Federated Foundation Models for Next-Generation Extended Reality Systems: Towards Privacy-Preserving Distributed Intelligence in AR/VR/MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05683</link>

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.</description>

      <title>Consistent and Invariant Generalization Learning for Short-video Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.</description>
