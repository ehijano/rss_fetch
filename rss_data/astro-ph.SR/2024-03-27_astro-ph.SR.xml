      <title>Detailed cool star flare morphology with CHEOPS and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. White-light stellar flares are proxies for some of the most energetic types of flares, but their triggering mechanism is still poorly understood. As they are associated with strong X and UV emission, their study is particularly relevant to estimate the amount of high-energy irradiation onto the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially those in their stars' habitable zone. Aims. We used the high-cadence, high-photometric capabilities of the CHEOPS and TESS space telescopes to study the detailed morphology of white-light flares occurring in a sample of 130 late-K and M stars, and compared our findings with results obtained at a lower cadence. We developed dedicated software for this purpose. Results. Multi-peak flares represent a significant percentage ($\gtrsim 30$\%) of the detected outburst events. Our findings suggest that high-impulse flares are more frequent than suspected from lower-cadence data, so that the most impactful flux levels that hit close-in exoplanets might be more time-limited than expected. We found significant differences in the duration distributions of single-peak and complex flare components, but not in their peak luminosity. A statistical analysis of the flare parameter distributions provides marginal support for their description with a log-normal instead of a power-law function, leaving the door open to several flare formation scenarios. We tentatively confirmed previous results about quasi-periodic pulsations in high-cadence photometry, report the possible detection of a pre-flare dip, and did not find hints of photometric variability due to an undetected flare background. Conclusions. The high-cadence study of stellar hosts might be crucial to evaluate the impact of their flares on close-in exoplanets, as their impulsive phase emission might otherwise be incorrectly estimated. Future telescopes such as PLATO and Ariel will help in this respect.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Helicity Signs and Flaring Propensity: Comparing Force-free Parameter with the Helicity signs of H{\alpha} Filaments and X-ray Sigmoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sigmoids produce strong eruptive events. Earlier studies have shown that the ICME axial magnetic field Bz can be predicted with some credibility by observing the corresponding filament or the polarity inversion line in the region of eruption and deriving the magnetic field direction from that. Sigmoids are coronal structures often associated with filaments in the sigmoidal region. In this study, firstly we compare filament chirality with sigmoid handedness to observe their correlation. Secondly, we perform non-linear force-free approximations of the coronal magnetic connectivity using photospheric vector magnetograms underneath sigmoids to obtain a weighted-average value of the force-free parameter and to correlate it with filament chirality and the observed coronal sigmoid handedness. Importantly, we find that the sigmoids and their filament counterparts do not always have the same helicity signs. Production of eruptive events by regions that do not have the same signs of helicities is $\sim$3.5 times higher than when they do. A case study of magnetic energy/ helicity evolution in NOAA AR 12473 is also presented.</description>

      <title>Runaway OB Stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud III. Updated Kinematics and Insights on Dynamical vs. Supernova Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the kinematics of field OB stars to estimate the frequencies of runaway stars generated by the dynamical ejection scenario (DES), the binary supernova scenario (BSS), and the combined two-step mechanism. We update the proper motions for field OB and OBe stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3. Our sample now contains 336 stars from the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4), and we update our algorithm to calculate more accurate velocities compared to those obtained previously from DR2. We find a decrease in median velocity from 39 to 29 km/s, implying that the proper motions from our previous work were systematically overestimated. We present the velocity distribution for OBe stars and quantitatively compare it to those of non-compact binaries and high-mass X-ray binaries. We confirm that OBe stars appear to be dominated by the BSS and are likely post-SN binary systems, further supporting the mass-transfer model to explain the origin of their emission-line disks. In contrast, normal OB stars may show a bimodal velocity distribution, as may be expected from different processes that occur with dynamical ejections. The kinematics of fast-rotating OB stars are similar to those of normal OB stars rather than OBe stars, suggesting that the origin of their high v_r*sin(i) is different from that of OBe stars. We update our model parameters describing the kinematic origins of the SMC field population, still confirming that for runaway stars, the DES mechanism dominates, and two-step ejections seem comparable in frequency to pure BSS ejections.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spin Down in Post-Mass Transfer Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by measurements of the rotation speed of accretor stars in post-mass-transfer (post-MT) systems, we investigate how magnetic braking affects the spin-down of individual stars during binary evolution with the \texttt{MESAbinary} module. Unlike the conventional assumption of tidal synchronization coupled with magnetic braking in binaries, we first calculate whether tides are strong enough to synchronize the orbit. Subsequently, this influences the spin-down of stars and the orbital separation. In this study, we apply four magnetic braking prescriptions to reduce the spin angular momentum of the two stars throughout the entire binary evolution simulation. Our findings reveal that despite magnetic braking causing continuous spin-down of the accretor, when the donor begins to transfer material onto the accretor, the accretor can rapidly spin up to its critical rotation rate. After MT, magnetic braking becomes more important in affecting the angular momentum evolution of the stars. Post-MT accretor stars thus serve as a valuable testbed for observing how the magnetic braking prescriptions operate in spinning down stars from their critical rotation, including the saturation regimes of the magnetic braking. The rotation rate of the accretor star, combined with its mass, could provide age information since the cessation of MT. By comparing the models against observation, the magnetic braking prescription by Garraffo et al. (2018b) is found to better align with the rotation data of post-MT accretors.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en Waves at Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind upstream of Mars's bow shock can be described in terms of Alfv\'enic turbulence, with an incompressible energy cascade rate of $10^{-17}$ J m$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ at magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) scales. The solar wind has more Alfv\'en waves propagating outwards from the Sun (than inwards) and a median Alfv\'en ratio of $\sim0.33$. Newly ionized planetary protons associated with the extended hydrogen corona generate waves at the local proton cyclotron frequency. These 'proton cyclotron waves' (PCW) mostly correspond to fast magnetosonic waves, although the ion cyclotron (Alfv\'enic) wave mode is possible for large Interplanetary Magnetic Field cone angles. PCW do not show significant effects on the solar wind energy cascade rates at MHD scales but could affect smaller scales. The magnetosheath displays high amplitude wave activity, with high occurrence rate of Alfv\'en waves. Turbulence appears not fully developed in the magnetosheath, suggesting fluctuations do not have enough time to interact in this small-size region. Some studies suggest PCW affect turbulence in the magnetosheath. Overall, wave activity is reduced inside the magnetic pile-up region and the Martian ionosphere. However, under certain conditions, upstream waves can reach the upper ionosphere. So far, there have not been conclusive observations of Alfv\'en waves in the ionosphere or along crustal magnetic fields, which could be due to the lack of adequate observations.</description>

      <title>Short-term Classification of Strong Solar Energetic Particle Events using Multivariate Time Series Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting. Their prediction depends on various factors including source eruptions. In the present work, we use the Geostationary Solar Energetic Particle (GSEP) data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We develop a framework using time series-based machine learning (ML) models with the aim of developing robust short-term forecasts by classifying SEP events. For this purpose, we introduce an ensemble learning approach that merges the results from univariate time series of three proton channels (10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long band X-ray flux channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) missions and analyze their performance. We consider three models, namely, time series forest (TSF), supervised time series forest (STSF) and bag of SFA symbols (BOSS). Our study also focuses on understanding and developing confidence in the predictive capabilities of our models. Therefore, we utilize multiple evaluation techniques and metrics. Based on that, we find STSF to perform well in all scenarios. The summary of metrics for the STSF model is as follows: AUC = 0.981; F1-score = 0.960; TSS = 0.919; HSS = 0.920; GSS = 0.852; and MCC = 0.920. The Brier score loss of the STSF model is 0.077. This work lays the foundation for building near-real-time (NRT) short-term SEP event predictions using robust ML methods.</description>

      <title>Tracking the motion of a shock along a channel in the low solar corona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock waves are excited by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and large-scale extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave fronts and can result in low-frequency radio emission under certain coronal conditions. In this work, we investigate a moving source of low-frequency radio emission as a CME and an associated EUV wave front move along a channel of a lower density, magnetic field, and Alfv\'en speed in the solar corona. Observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Heliograph (NRH), and the Irish Low Frequency Array(I-LOFAR) were analysed. Differential emission measure maps were generated to determine densities and Alfv\'en maps, and the kinematics of the EUV wave front was tracked using CorPITA. The radio sources' positions and velocity were calculated from NRH images and I-LOFAR dynamic spectra. The EUV wave expanded radially with a uniform velocity of $\sim$ 500 km s$^{-1}$. However, the radio source was observed to be deflected and appeared to move along a channel of a lower Alfv\'en speed, abruptly slowing from 1700 km s$^{-1}$ to 250 km s$^{-1}$ as it entered a quiet-Sun region. A shock wave with an apparent radial velocity of &gt; 420 km s$^{-1}$ was determined from the drift rate of the associated Type II radio burst. The apparent motion of the radio source may have resulted from a wave front moving along a coronal wave guide or by different points along the wave front emitting at locations with favourable conditions for shock formation.</description>

      <title>Large Fluctuations within 1 AU in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are often assumed to change slowly and smoothly during planet formation. Here, we investigate the time evolution of isolated disks subject to viscosity and a disk wind. The viscosity is assumed to increase rapidly at around 900 K due to thermal ionization of alkali metals, or thermionic and ion emission from dust, and the onset of magneto-rotational instability (MRI). The disks generally undergo large, rapid fluctuations for a wide range of time-averaged mass accretion rates. Fluctuations involve coupled waves in temperature and surface density that move radially in either direction through the inner 1.5 AU of the disk. Two types of wave are seen with radial speeds of roughly 50 and 1000 cm/s respectively. The pattern of waves repeats with a period of roughly 10,000 years that depends weakly on the average mass accretion rate. Viscous transport due to MRI is confined to the inner disk. This region is resupplied by mass flux from the outer disk driven by the disk wind. Interior to 1 AU, the temperature and surface density can vary by a factor of 2--10 on timescales of years to ky. The stellar mass accretion rate varies by 3 orders of magnitude on a similar timescale. This behavior lasts for at least 1 My for initial disks comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula.</description>

      <title>On the Heating of the Slow Solar-Wind by Imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave Turbulence from 0.06 au to 1 au: Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we analyze plasma and magnetic field data provided by the Parker Solar Probe (\emph{PSP}) and Solar Orbiter (\emph{SO}) missions to investigate the radial evolution of the heating of Alfv\'enic slow wind (ASW) by imbalanced Alfv\'en-Wave (AW) turbulent fluctuations from 0.06 au to 1 au. in our analysis we focus on slow solar-wind intervals with highly imbalanced and incompressible turbulence (i.e., magnetic compressibility $C_B=\delta B/B\leq 0.25$, plasma compressibility $C_n=\delta n/n\leq 0.25$ and normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c\geq 0.65$). First, we estimate the AW turbulent dissipation rate from the wave energy equation and find that the radial profile trend is similar to the proton heating rate. Second, we find that the scaling of the empirical AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_W$ obtained from the wave energy equation matches the scaling from the phenomenological AW turbulent dissipation rate $Q_{\rm CH09}$ (with $Q_{\rm CH09}\simeq 1.55 Q_W$) derived by~\cite{chandran09} based on the model of reflection-driven turbulence. Our results suggest that, as in the fast solar wind, AW turbulence plays a major role in the ion heating that occurs in incompressible slow-wind streams.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on a submanifold: intermediate formalism versus Hamiltonian reduction of Dirac bracket, and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05151v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Hamiltonian formulation of a dynamical system forced to move on a submanifold $G_\alpha(q^A)=0$. If for some reasons we are interested in knowing the dynamics of all original variables $q^A(t)$, the most economical would be a Hamiltonian formulation on the intermediate phase-space submanifold spanned by reducible variables $q^A$ and an irreducible set of momenta $p_i$, $[i]=[A]-[\alpha]$. We describe and compare two different possibilities for establishing the Poisson structure and Hamiltonian dynamics on an intermediate submanifold: Hamiltonian reduction of the Dirac bracket and intermediate formalism. As an example of the application of intermediate formalism, we deduce on this basis the Euler-Poisson equations of a spinning body, establish the underlying Poisson structure, and write their general solution in terms of the exponential of the Hamiltonian vector field.</description>

      <title>Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N : A $\mathcal{O}(N)$ software for N-body integration in collisional and fragmenting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.</description>
