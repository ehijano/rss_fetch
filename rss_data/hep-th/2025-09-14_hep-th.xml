      <description>arXiv:2509.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Virasoro OPE and Conformal Blocks from the Inverse Shapovalov Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive expressions for the Virasoro OPE and four-point conformal blocks on the sphere via the resolution of identity recently determined in [Phys. Rev. D 111, 085010 (2025), arXiv:2409.12224]. Even though the resolution of the identity depends on Virasoro singular vectors, our expression for the blocks does not depend on their precise form, but just on their well-known conformal weights. We verify that our expression is compatible with -- but differs from -- Zamolodchikov's $h$-recursion relation and we also examine the impact of various large central charge limits in our formula. A Mathematica notebook with a simple implementation of our expression for the Virasoro conformal blocks is provided as an ancillary file.</description>

      <title>QM2-branes and the Swampland Distance Conjecture in nine dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the Swampland program and QM2-branes, which are supersymmetric M2-branes with discrete spectrum. The worldvolume description of these M2-branes is well-known. The global description is given in terms of twisted torus bundles with monodromy in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we show that the towers of states that ensure the Swampland Distance Conjecture for type II maximal supergravity in nine dimensions are directly related to QM2-branes with trivial monodromy on a background that is toroidally compactified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate coupling selection rules in heterotic string theory on non-Abelian orbifolds. Since boundary conditions on the orbifolds are classified by conjugacy classes of space group elements, non-Abelian orbifolds give rise to non-invertible selection rules on couplings among twisted sectors as well as ones including untwisted sectors. Furthermore, we find that non-invertible selection rules lead to characteristic patterns of Yukawa matrices.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained BCFT Tensor Networks and Holographic Reflected Entropy in 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the framework of $\textit{BCFT tensor networks}$ to present a microscopic CFT derivation of the correspondence between reflected entropy (RE) and entanglement wedge cross section (EW) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, for both bipartite and multipartite settings. These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.</description>

      <title>On Casimir effect in Yang-Mills theories in three and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the Casimir energy for the configuration of two parallel plates coupled to nonabelian gauge fields with a Yang-Mills action. We consider both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions in the manifestly gauge-invariant formalism we have pursued over the last several years which allows us to factor out the gauge degrees of freedom. A boundary action in the functional integral, equivalent to the insertion of operators representing the plates, is used to enforce the required boundary conditions for the gauge fields. The result is for a kinematic regime corresponding to the exchange of gluons with a dynamically generated mass. We find good agreement in 2+1 dimensions and reasonable agreement in 3+1 dimensions with lattice-based numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for Continuous Symmetries: Non-linear Realizations and Spontaneous Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that continuous symmetries of quantum fields can be realized non-linearly, e.g. in the context of sigma models, and can also be spontaneously broken on non-compact spacetimes. In this note we study how these effects are realized in the context of the topological symmetry theory for continuous symmetries. In particular, we explain cosets realizations and their higher $p$-form symmetry versions from this perspective, as well as uplifts to higher groups and non-invertible symmetries. Moreover, using a setup with boundaries and corners, we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios for higher $p$-form symmetries as well as non-Abelian $0$-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>An emergent higher-form symmetry from type IIB superstring theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a higher-form symmetry in type IIB superstring theory, which possesses an ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. From the point of view of the low-energy effective field theory, the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is treated as a gauge symmetry. Hence, an $8$-form global symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ emerges as a quantum symmetry. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of the topological operator associated with the $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ symmetry. In this construction, the discriminant $\Delta(\tau)$ plays a central role. As a result, it becomes manifest that $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ is the solitonic symmetry of $7$-branes. Furthermore, taking into account the extensions of the duality group, we also discuss what global symmetries emerge when considering not ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ but ${\rm Mp}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and ${\rm Pin}^+({\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}))={\rm GL}^+(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Bianchi-I cosmology with scale dependent $G$ and $\Lambda$ in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic Bianchi-I (BI) cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections into the Einstein equation through the scale-dependent Newton coupling and cosmological term, as determined by the flow equation of the effective action for gravity. For the cosmological term $\Lambda_0=0$, we derive the quantum-corrected power-series solution for a general equation-of-state parameter $w$ in the range $-1&lt;w\leq 1$ in the form of expansions in both inverse cosmic time and the anisotropy parameter. We give a general criterion, valid for any $\Lambda_0$, if the solution becomes isotropic in the late time, which indicates that the universe becomes isotropic for most cases of $-1&lt;w&lt;1$ except $w=1$. By numerical analysis, we show that quantum corrections lead to earlier isotropization compared to the classical case starting from an initially highly anisotropic state. In contrast, for $\Lambda_0 &gt;0$, we obtain the inverse power-series solution in the exponential of the cosmic time. We find that the universe always becomes isotropic in the late time, in accordance with the cosmic no hair theorem, and the quantum corrections make the isotropization faster. We also briefly summarize the Kasner solution and its generalization with quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</description>

      <title>The 3D index and Dehn filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous proof of the Gang-Yonekura formula describing the transformation of the 3D index under Dehn filling a cusp in an orientable 3-manifold. The 3D index, originally introduced by Dimofte, Gaiotto and Gukov, is a physically inspired q-series that encodes deep topological and geometric information about cusped 3-manifolds. Building on the interpretation of the 3D index as a generating function over Q-normal surfaces, we introduce a relative version of the index for ideal triangulations with exposed boundary. This notion allows us to formulate a relative Gang-Yonekura formula, which we prove by developing a gluing principle for relative indices and establishing an inductive framework in the case of layered solid tori. Our approach makes use of Garoufalidis-Kashaev's meromorphic extension of the index, along with new identities involving q-hypergeometric functions. As an application, we study the limiting behaviour of the index for large fillings. We also develop code to perform certified computations of the index, guaranteeing correctness up to a specified accuracy. Our extensive computations support the topological invariance of the 3D index and suggest a well-defined extension to closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of quantum spacetime that are consistent with quantum energy inequalities potentially enable the formation of Planck scale wormholes. Building on the proposal of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever that such microscopic spacetime structures might be enlarged to macroscopic size, we revisit Roman's analysis of a wormhole in an inflationary de Sitter background. In this context, we introduce a refined quasi-local toy mechanism, which we call the local inflation bubble. This construction inflates a compact region of spacetime and thereby magnifies the underlying microstructure. Using the Einstein equations we determine the required stress-energy to sustain the bubble and obtain intrinsic lower bounds for the corresponding energy density, while acknowledging the continued reliance on exotic matter.</description>

      <title>On the semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the first author with A. Ardehali, M. Lemos, and L. Rastelli introduced the notion of graded unitarity for vertex algebras. This generalization of unitarity is motivated by the SCFT/VOA correspondence and introduces a novel Hilbert space structure on the state space of a large class of vertex algebras that are not unitary in the conventional sense. In this paper, we study the relative semi-infinite cohomology of graded-unitary vertex algebras that admit a chiral quantum moment map for an affine current algebra at twice the critical level. We show that the relative semi-infinite chain complex for such a graded-unitary vertex algebra has a structure analogous to that of differential forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold, generalizing a strong form of the classic construction of Banks--Peskin and Frenkel--Garland--Zuckerman. We deduce that the relative semi-infinite cohomology is itself graded-unitary, which establishes graded unitarity for a large class of vertex operator algebras arising from three- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories. We further establish an outer USp$(2)$ action on the semi-infinite cohomology (which does not respect cohomological grading), analogous to the Lefschetz $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ in K\"ahler geometry. We also show that the semi-infinite chain complex is quasi-isomorphic as a differential graded vertex algebra to its cohomology, in analogy to the formality result of Deligne--Griffiths--Morgan--Sullivan for the de Rham cohomology of compact K\"ahler manifolds. We conclude by observing consequences of these results to the associated Poisson vertex algebras and related finite-type derived Poisson reductions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signature and the Nature of Neutrino Masses: Majorana, Dirac, or Pseudo-Dirac?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermionic nature of neutrinos and the origin of their tiny masses remain unresolved issues in particle physics, intrinsically connected to lepton number symmetry-conserved for Dirac, violated for Majorana, and effectively pseudo-Dirac when global symmetries invoked for conservation are broken by quantum gravity. We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.</description>

      <title>Comment on the cosmological constant for $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article we showed that the analog of the cosmological constant in two spacetime dimensions for a wide variety of integrable quantum field theories has the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = - m^2 /2 \mathfrak{g} $ where $m$ is a physical mass and $\mathfrak{g} $ is a generalized coupling, where in the free field limit $\mathfrak{g} \to 0$, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ diverges. We speculated that in four spacetime dimensions $\rho_{\rm vac} $ takes a similar form $\rho_{\rm vac} = - m^4/2 \mathfrak{g}$, but did not support this idea in any specific model. In this article we study this problem for $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d$ spacetime dimensions. We show how to obtain the exact $\rho_{\rm vac}$ for the sinh-Gordon theory in the weak coupling limit by using a saddle point approximation. This calculation indicates that the cosmological constant can be well-defined, positive or negative, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. We also show that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ satisfies a Callan-Symanzik type of renormalization group equation. For the most interesting case physically, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is positive and can arise from a marginally relevant negative coupling $\mathfrak{g}$ and the cosmological constant flows to zero at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the renormalisation of Einstein gravity using a novel subtraction scheme in dimensional regularisation. The one-loop beta function for Newton's constant receives contributions from poles in even dimensions and can be mapped to the beta function obtained using a proper-time cutoff. Field redefinitions are used to remove off-shell contributions to the renormalisation group equations. To check the consistency of our approximations we use a general parametrisation of the metric fluctuation. Within truncations of the derivative expansion and the expansion in Newton's constant, we show that the parametrisation dependence can be removed order by order. Going to all orders in the scalar curvature an all-order beta function for Newton's constant is obtained that is independent of the parameterisation. The beta function vanishes at the Reuter fixed point and the critical exponent is in good agreement with non-perturbative calculations. Finally, we compare the critical exponent to the counterpart computed via Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT).</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Emergent AdS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a $\textit{Twisted Modular Inclusion}$ and a $\textit{Twisted Modular Intersection}$ property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB analysis for dynamical and geometric exponents in generalized and nonlinear Landau-Zener transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Berry phase is a geometric phase that is important in explaining topological quantum phenomena. The Berry phase is also important in non-perturbative phenomena, as the imaginary part of the phase explains the non-perturbative transitions. However, problems arose because the singular perturbation with respect to the Planck constant has not been treated adequately in conventional calculations, where the most serious problem is the arbitrariness of approximate calculations. To solve this problem, we consider the exact WKB, which is a mathematical method that treats perturbative expansion with respect to the Planck constant as a rigorous singular perturbation. This method is also a powerful computational tool that makes analytical computation much easier for mathematical software. Using the exact WKB, we analyze the derivation of the dynamical and the geometric exponents in generalized Landau-Zener models, highlighting the differences from other calculational methods. The discontinuity of complex geometric factor is a universal phenomenon that manifests itself in phase transitions, boundaries, particle generation, and topology changes. These phenomena are ``non-perturbative'' in physics, while mathematically, these discontinuities can be deeply related to the singular structure of complex analysis. The mathematical structure of these phenomena will be revealed by using the exact WKB.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>

Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the BGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson class not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\upbeta$ case we also argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to obtain it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and comparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>

      <title>The holographic entanglement pattern of BTZ planar black hole from a thread perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the holographic quantum entanglement structure in the finite-temperature CFT state/planar BTZ black hole correspondence from the perspective of entanglement threads. Unlike previous studies based on bit threads, these entanglement threads provide a more detailed characterization of the contribution sources to the von Neumann entropy of boundary subregions, in particular by quantitatively deriving the flux function of entanglement threads that traverse the wormhole horizon and connect the two asymptotic boundaries. Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary. We also discuss the close connections of this work with concepts such as bit threads and partial entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the holographic entropy cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropies computed using the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi formula are known to obey an infinite set of linear inequalities, which define the so-called RT entropy cone. The general structure of this cone, or equivalently the set of all valid inequalities, is unknown. It is also unknown whether those same inequalities are also obeyed by entropies computed using the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, although significant evidence has accumulated that they are. Using Markov states, we develop a test of this conjecture in a heretofore unexplored regime. The test reduces to checking that a given inequality obeys a certain majorization property, which is easy to evaluate. We find that the RT inequalities pass this test and, surprisingly, only RT inequalities do so. Our results not only provide strong new evidence that the HRT and RT cones coincide, but also offer a completely new characterization of that cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate elliptical Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills theory at weak and strong coupling for small values of the eccentricity. We obtain analytical results for the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the form of a series in the eccentricity parameter. At weak coupling, we use perturbation theory in ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang--Mills. At strong coupling, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence, which maps the Wilson loop to the minimal-area worldsheet of an open string in AdS space. We present a novel perturbative method to solve the Nambu--Goto equations allowing us to describe the minimal surface in terms of a coordinate parameterization in Euclidean AdS$_3$. Our results for the regularized area agree with those obtained by Dekel in [1] based on the Polyakov action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to deriving positivity bounds on effective field theories by analyzing the thermodynamic behavior of thermal quantum field systems. Focusing on scalar theories with higher-dimensional operators, we compute the finite-temperature entropy using thermal field theory techniques. We argue that consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles--specifically, the expectation that entropy increases with the introduction of new degrees of freedom--imposes nontrivial constraints on Wilson coefficients. In particular, we show that the coefficient of the leading dimension-8 operator must be strictly positive. This thermodynamic perspective offers an alternative to traditional S-matrix-based derivations of positivity bounds and provides a complementary perspective into the interplay between entropy, unitarity, and causality in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh non-perturbative field theory of open quantum systems beyond the Markovian regime: Application to spin-boson and spin-chain-boson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00765v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for open quantum systems composed of many mutually interacting quantum spins, or any isomorphic systems like qubits and qudits, surrounded by one or more independent bosonic baths. Our framework, based on Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT), can handle arbitrary spin value S, dimensionality of space, and geometry, while being applicable to a large parameter space for system and bath or their coupling. It can probe regimes in which non-Markovian dynamics and nonperturbative effects pose formidable challenges for other state-of-the-art theoretical methods. This is achieved by working with the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which resums classes of Feynman diagrams of SKFT to an infinite order. Furthermore, such diagrams are generated via an expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons we employ to map spin operators onto canonically commuting ones, rather than via conventional expansion in system-bath coupling constant. We carefully benchmark our SKFT+2PI-computed results vs. numerically (quasi)exact ones from tensor network calculations applied to the archetypical spin-boson model where both methodologies are applicable. Additionally, we demonstrate the capability of SKFT+2PI to handle a much more complex spin-chain-boson model with multiple baths interacting with each spin where no benchmark from other methods is available at present. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by the SKFT+2PI framework with an increasing number of spins and time steps makes it a promising route for simulating driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing, quantum magnonics, and quantum spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a methodology to infer the reheat temperature ($T_{\rm RH}$) of the Universe from the collider signal of freezing in dark matter (DM). We demonstrate it for the mono-$\gamma$ signal at the electron-positron colliders, which indicates to a low-scale $T_{\rm RH}$, after addressing observed DM abundance, BBN, and other relevant constraints. The method can be used to correlate different reheating dynamics, DM models, and collider signals.</description>

Abstract: The Feigin-Frenkel homomorphism underpinning the Wakimoto construction realises an affine Lie algebra at critical level in terms of the $\beta\gamma$-system of free fields. It was recently shown that much of the construction also goes through for double loop algebras. However, certain divergent sums appear. In this paper, we show that, suggestively, these sums vanish when one performs $\zeta$-function regularisation.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric teleparallel gravity and its $f(Q)$ extensions have emerged as promising alternatives to General Relativity (GR), yet the role of explicit geometry-matter couplings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a generalized $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ theory, where the gravitational Lagrangian density depends on both the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_m$. This formulation naturally includes Coincident GR and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR as special cases. Working in the metric formalism, we derive the corresponding field equations, which generalize those of the standard $f(Q)$ gravity, and obtain the modified Klein-Gordon equation for scenarios involving scalar fields. The cosmological implications of the theory are explored in the context of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. As a first step, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$ gravity in full generality. We then investigate specific cosmological models arising from both linear and non-linear choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_m)$, performing detailed comparisons with the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and examining their observational consequences.</description>

Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

      <title>Cloning Games, Black Holes and Cryptography</title>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new toolkit for analyzing cloning games, a notion that captures stronger and more quantitative versions of the celebrated quantum no-cloning theorem. This framework allows us to analyze a new cloning game based on binary phase states. Our results provide evidence that these games may be able to overcome important limitations of previous candidates based on BB84 states and subspace coset states: in a model where the adversaries are restricted to making a single oracle query, we show that the binary phase variant is $t$-copy secure when $t=o(n/\log n)$. Moreover, for constant $t$, we obtain the first optimal bounds of $O(2^{-n})$, asymptotically matching the value attained by a trivial adversarial strategy. We also show a worst-case to average-case reduction which allows us to show the same quantitative results for the new and natural notion of Haar cloning games.
  Our analytic toolkit, which we believe will find further applications, is based on binary subtypes and uses novel bounds on the operator norms of block-wise tensor products of matrices. To illustrate the effectiveness of these new techniques, we present two applications: first, in black-hole physics, where our asymptotically optimal bound offers quantitative insights into information scrambling in idealized models of black holes; and second, in unclonable cryptography, where we (a) construct succinct unclonable encryption schemes from the existence of pseudorandom unitaries, and (b) propose and provide evidence for the security of multi-copy unclonable encryption schemes.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy-induced phases) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, which encompasses a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the formation of the event horizon. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Multishell Dirac fermions in the Einstein-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multifermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Dirac system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of previous studies of the Einstein-Dirac system are restricted to two neutral fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells, similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a spherically symmetric system. Even single-shell multifermions exhibit a multipeak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The behavior observed in our multishell model can be explained by interactions between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of intershell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.</description>
