      <title>Conditional means, vector pricings, amenability and fixed points in cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. This leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>

      <title>Concentration of the truncated variation of fractional Brownian motions of any Hurst index, their $1/H$-variations and local times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain bounds for probabilities of deviations of the truncated variation functional of fractional Brownian motions (fBm) of any Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$ from their expected values. Obtained bounds are optimal for large values of deviations up to multiplicative constants depending on the parameter $H$ only. As an application, we give tight bounds for tails of $1/H$-variations of fBm along Lebesgue partitions and establish the a.s. weak convergence (in $L^1$) of normalized numbers of strip crossings by the trajectories of fBm to their local times for any Hurst parameter $H \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Monge solutions and uniqueness in multi-marginal optimal transport with hierarchical jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Jump multi-marginal transport (HJMOT), a generalization of multi-marginal optimal transport where mass can "jump" over intermediate spaces via augmented isolated points. Established on Polish spaces, the framework guarantees the existence of Kantorovich solutions and, under sequential differentiability and a twist condition, the existence and uniqueness of Monge solutions. This core theory extends robustly to diverse settings, including smooth Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating its versatility as a unified framework for optimal transport across complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities of MA(1) sequences with Laplace innovations and $q$-deformed zigzag numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the persistence probabilities of a moving average process of order one with innovations that follow a Laplace distribution. The persistence probabilities can be computed fully explicitly in terms of classical combinatorial quantities like certain $q$-Pochhammer symbols or $q$-deformed analogues of Euler's zigzag numbers, respectively. Similarly, the generating functions of the persistence probabilities can be written in terms of $q$-analogues of the exponential function or the $q$-sine/$q$-cosine functions, respectively.</description>

      <title>On fractal minimizers and potentials of occupation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four prototypes of variational problems and prove the existence of fractal minimizers through the direct method in the calculus of variations. By design these minimizers are H\"older curves or H\"older parametrizations of hypersurfaces whose images generally have a non-integer Hausdorff dimension. Although their origin is deterministic, their regularity properties are roughly similar to those of typical realizations of stochastic processes. As a key tool, we prove novel continuity and boundedness results for potentials of occupation measures of Gaussian random fields. These results complement well-known results for local times, but hold under much less restrictive assumptions. In an auxiliary section, we generalize earlier results on non-linear compositions of fractional Sobolev functions with $BV$-functions to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a segment $\{1,\ldots,b_N\}$ and are interested in its total variation distance to equilibrium when started from an initial configuration $\xi^{N}$. We provide a general result which gives the cutoff window and profile whenever a KPZ-type limit theorem is available for an extension of $\xi^{N}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$. We apply this result to obtain the cutoff window and profile of ASEP on the segment with flat, half-flat and step initial data. Our arguments are entirely probabilistic and make no use of Hecke algebras.</description>

      <title>Large field problem in coercive singular PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20716v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a priori estimates for singular differential equations of the form \[ \mathcal{L} \phi = P(\phi,\nabla\phi) + f(\phi,\nabla\phi)\xi \] where $P$ is a polynomial, $f$ is a sufficiently well-behaved function, and $\xi$ is an irregular distribution such that the equation is subcritical. The differential operator $\mathcal L$ is either a derivative in time, in which case we interpret the equation using rough path theory, or a heat operator, in which case we interpret the equation using regularity structures. Our only assumption on $P$ is that solutions with $\xi=0$ exhibit coercivity. Our estimates are local in space and time, and independent of boundary conditions.
  One of our main results is an abstract estimate that allows one to pass from a local coercivity property to a global one using scaling, for a large class of equations. This allows us to reduce the problem of deriving a priori estimates to the case when $\xi$ is small.</description>

      <title>Dropout Neural Network Training Viewed from a Percolation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.
  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.</description>

      <title>Representation theory and cycle statistics for random walks on the symmetric group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use representation theory of $S_n$ to analyze the mixing of permutation cycle type statistics $a_j(\sigma) = ${# of $j$-cycles of $\sigma$} for any fixed $j$ and $\sigma$ resulting from a random $i$-cycle walk on $S_n$. We also derive analogous results for the random star transposition walk. Our approach uses the method of moments; a key ingredient is a new formula for the coefficients in the irreducible character decomposition of the $S_n$-class function $(a_j)^r(\sigma)=\{(\text{# of $j$-cycles of $\sigma$})^r\}$ for any positive integers $r,j$ when $n\geq 2rj$.</description>

      <title>Monotone max-convolution and subordination functions for free max-convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the distribution of the spectral maximum of monotonically independent self-adjoint operators coincides with the classical max-convolution of their distributions. In free probability, it was proven that for any probability measures $\sigma,\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ there is a unique probability measure $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ satisfying $\sigma\boxplus \mu = \sigma \triangleright \mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$, where $\boxplus$ and $\triangleright$ are free and monotone additive convolutions, respectively. We recall that the reciprocal Cauchy transform of $\mathbb{A}_\sigma(\mu)$ is the subordination function for free additive convolution. Motivated by this analogy, we introduce subordination functions for free max-convolution and prove their existence and structural properties.</description>

      <title>Random-Bridges as Stochastic Transports for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper motivates the use of random-bridges -- stochastic processes conditioned to take target distributions at fixed timepoints -- in the realm of generative modelling. Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of the solutions of a nonlinear renewal equation. The main contribution of the present article is to provide stability and convergence results around equilibrium solutions, under some local subcritical condition. Quantitative rates of convergence to equilibrium are established. Instability results are given in both the critical and supercritical cases. As an implication of these results, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for Hawkes processes in a mean-field interaction.</description>

Unlike the previously known results, our estimate does not involve Sobolev derivatives of solutions and coefficients. The diffusion matrices are supposed to be non-singular, bounded and satisfy the Dini mean oscillation condition.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansion of the log-likelihood ratio: Optimal detection of planted matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand how hidden information can be extracted from statistical networks, planted models in random graphs have been the focus of intensive study in recent years. In this work, we consider the detection of a planted matching, i.e., an independent edge set, hidden in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, which is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. We identify the critical regime for this testing problem and prove that the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically normal. Via analyses of computationally efficient edge or wedge count test statistics that attain the optimal limits of detection, our results also reveal the absence of a statistical-to-computational gap. Our main technical tool is the cluster expansion from statistical physics, which allows us to prove a precise, non-asymptotic characterization of the log-likelihood ratio. Our analyses rely on a careful reorganization and cancellation of terms that occur in the difference between monomer-dimer log partition functions on the complete and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. This combinatorial and statistical physics approach represents a significant departure from the more established methods such as orthogonal decompositions, and positions the cluster expansion as a viable technique in the study of log-likelihood ratios for planted models in general.</description>

Abstract: We develop a method to prove that certain percolation processes on amenable random rooted graphs are factors of iid (fiid), given that the process is a monotone limit of random finite subgraphs that satisfy a certain independent stochastic domination property. Among the consequences are the previously open claims that the Uniform Spanning Forest (USF) is a factor of iid for recurrent graphs, it is a finite-valued finitary fiid on amenable graphs, and that the critical Ising model on $\Z^d$ is a finite-valued finitary fiid, using the known uniqueness of the Gibbs measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the multiplicative chaos measure associated to the log-correlated random Fourier series, or random wave model, with i.i.d. coefficients taken from a general class of distributions. This measure was shown to be non-degenerate when the inverse temperature is subcritical by Junnila (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2020 (2020), no. 19, 6169-6196). When the coefficients are Gaussian, this measure is an example of a Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), a well-studied universal object in the study of log-correlated fields. In the case of non-Gaussian coefficients, the resulting chaos is not a GMC in general. However, we construct a coupling between the non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure and a GMC such that the two are almost surely mutually absolutely continuous.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigate the sparse multi-type Erd\H{o}s R\'enyi random graphs studied in S\"{o}derberg~\cite{soderberg2002general} and also Bollob\'as et al.~\cite{bollobas2007phase}. Although the corresponding central limit results are currently unknown, we establish moderate deviation principles for the size of the largest connected component, the number of specific types of connected components, and the total number of connected components. The associated rate functions are provided explicitly. As a byproduct of this work, we present the law of large numbers for the total number of connected components. Our proof methodology relies on representing the multi-type random graph using a conditional multi-dimensional compound Poisson process. We also discuss the properties of related multi-type branching processes and the properties of the matrices in the rate functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using Feynman-Kac formula for moments, we also obtain exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviations of many--server queues, idempotent processes and quasipotentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Large Deviation Principle (LDP) is established for the stationary distribution of the number of customers in a many--server queue in heavy traffic for a moderate deviation scaling akin to the Halfin--Whitt regime. The interarrival and service times are assumed generally distributed. The deviation function is given by a quasipotential. It is related to the longterm idempotent distribution of the large deviation limit of the number-in-the-system process. New results on the
  trajectorial LDP for that process are also obtained. Proofs rely on the characterisation of large deviation relatively compact sequences as exponentially tight ones and use methods of weak convergence and idempotent processes. Another contribution of the paper concerns bounds on the higher--order moments of counting renewal processes.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{T}$ be the two-dimensional triangular lattice, and $\mathbb{Z}$ the one-dimensional integer lattice. Let $\mathbb{T}\times \mathbb{Z}$ denote the Cartesian product graph. Consider the Ising model defined on this graph with inverse temperature $\beta$ and external field $h$, and let $\beta_c$ be the critical inverse temperature when $h=0$. We prove that for each $\beta\in[0,\beta_c)$, there exists $h_c(\beta)&gt;0$ such that both a unique infinite $+$cluster and a unique infinite $-$cluster coexist whenever $|h|&lt;h_c(\beta)$. The same coexistence result also holds for the three-dimensional triangular lattice.</description>

Abstract: This article studies the temporal law of the KPZ fixed point. For the stationary geometry, we find the two-time law, which extends the single time law due to Baik-Rains and Ferrari-Spohn. For the droplet geometry, we find a relatively simpler formula for the multi-time law compared to a previous formula of Johansson and the author. These formulas are derived as the scaling limit of corresponding multi-time formulas for geometric last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity bounds in the Sliced Wasserstein distance for Schur stable autoregressive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explicit calculations in dimension one show for Schur stable autoregressive processes with standard Gaussian noise that the ergodic convergence in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance is essentially given by the sum of the mean, which decays exponentially, and the standard deviation, which decays with twice the speed. This paper starts by showing new upper and lower multivariate affine transport bounds for the Wasserstein-$r$ distance for $r$ greater and equal to $1$. These bounds allow to formulate a novel sufficient (non-Gaussian) ergodic interpolation condition for the mentioned mean-variance behavior to take place in case of more general Schur stable multivariate autoregressive processes. All ergodic estimates are non-asymptotic with completely explicit constants. The main applications are precise thermalization bounds for Schur stable $\mathsf{AR}(p)$ and $\mathsf{ARMA}(p,q)$ models in Wasserstein and Sliced Wasserstein distance. In the sequel we establish with the help of coupling techniques explicit upper and lower exponential bounds for more general multivariate Schur stable autoregressive processes. This includes parallel sampling and the convergence of the empiricial means. The utility of our results in particular for the Sliced Wasserstein distance are confirmed by multivariate numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sequences of homogeneous sums based on independent random variables and satisfying a central limit theorem (CLT). We address the following question: "In which cases is it not possible to reduce such an asymptotic result to the classical Lindeberg-Feller CLT through a restriction of the summation domain?". We provide several sufficient conditions for such irreducibility, expressed both in terms of (hyper)graphs Laplace eigenvalues, and of a certain notion of combinatorial dimension. Our analysis combines Cheeger-type inequalities with fourth moment theorems, showing that the irreducibility of a given CLT for homogeneous sums can be naturally encoded by the connectivity properties of the associated sequence of weighted hypergraphs. Several ad-hoc constructions are provided in the special case of quadratic forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability that the origin is connected to the boundary of the box of size $n$ (the one-arm probability) in several percolation models related to the Ising model. We prove that different universality classes emerge at criticality.
  - For the FK-Ising measure in a box of size $n$ with wired boundary conditions, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  - For the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^2$ in dimensions $d&gt;6$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=6$.
  - For the sourceless double random current measure, we prove that this probability decays as $1/n^{d-2}$ in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and as $1/n^{2+o(1)}$ when $d=4$.
  Additionally, for the infinite volume FK-Ising measure, we show that the one-arm probability is $1/n^{1+o(1)}$ in dimension $d=4$, and at least $1/n^{3/2}$ in dimension $d=5$. This establishes that the FK-Ising model has upper-critical dimension equal to $6$, in contrast to the Ising model, where it is known to be less or equal to $4$, thus solving a conjecture of Chayes, Coniglio, Machta, and Shtengel.</description>

      <title>A fresh look at Bivariate Binomial Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binomial distributions capture the probabilities of `heads' outcomes when a (biased) coin is tossed multiple times. The coin may be identified with a distribution on the two-element set {0,1}, where the 1 outcome corresponds to `head'. One can also toss two separate coins, with different biases, in parallel and record the outcomes. This paper investigates a slightly different `bivariate' binomial distribution, where the two coins are dependent (also called: entangled, or entwined): the two-coin is a distribution on the product {0,1} x {0,1}. This bivariate binomial exists in the literature, with complicated formulations. Here we use the language of category theory to give a new succint formulation. This paper investigates, also in categorically inspired form, basic properties of these bivariate distributions, including their mean, variance and covariance, and their behaviour under convolution and under updating, in Laplace's rule of succession. Furthermore, it is shown how Expectation Maximisation works for these bivariate binomials, so that mixtures of bivariate binomials can be recognised in data. This paper concentrates on the bivariate case, but the binomial distributions may be generalised to the multivariate case, with multiple dimensions, in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Explicit correlation functions for the six-vertex model in the free-fermion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show that, in the free-fermion regime of the six-vertex model, all $k$-point correlation functions of vertex types admit a determinantal representation: \begin{align*} \mathbb{P}\Bigg( \bigcap_{p=1}^k \{ \text{vertex at } v^p \text{ has type } t_p \} \Bigg) = \left( \prod_{p=1}^k a_{t_p} \right)
  \det\big[ L(x^i,y^j) \big]_{i,j=1}^{2k}, \end{align*} where $t_1,\ldots,t_k \in \{1,\ldots,6\}$ label the six possible vertex types, and $\{a_t : 1 \leq t \leq 6\}$ are the corresponding six-vertex weights. For each $1 \leq p \leq k$, the four points $x^{2p-1}, x^{2p}, y^{2p-1}, y^{2p} \in (\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$ are $t_p$-dependent choices among the midpoints of the edges incident to $v^p$. The correlation kernel $L$ has the contour integral representation \begin{align*} L(x,y) = \oint_{|w_1|=1} \oint_{|w_2|=1}
  \frac{dw_1}{2\pi i\, w_1}\,
  \frac{dw_2}{2\pi i\, w_2}\,
  w_1^{\,y_1 - x_1}\, w_2^{\,y_2 - x_2}\,
  h\big(c(x),c(y);w_1,w_2\big), \end{align*} where $h\big(c(x),c(y);w_1,w_2\big)$ is a simple rational function of $(w_1,w_2)$ that depends on $x$ and $y$ only through their orientations $c(x)$ and $c(y)$. Our proof is fully self-contained: we construct a determinantal point process on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and identify the six-vertex model as its pushforward under an explicit mapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method of nowcasting using regression on path signatures. Path signatures capture the geometric properties of sequential data. Because signatures embed observations in continuous time, they naturally handle mixed frequencies and missing data. We prove theoretically, and with simulations, that regression on signatures subsumes the linear Kalman filter and retains desirable consistency properties. Nowcasting with signatures is more robust to disruptions in data series than previous methods, making it useful in stressed times (for example, during COVID-19). This approach is performant in nowcasting US GDP growth, and in nowcasting UK unemployment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Systemic Risk in a Renewal Model with Multiple Business Lines and Heterogeneous Claims</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systemic risk is receiving increasing attention in the insurance industry. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional L\'{e}vy process-based renewal risk model with heterogeneous insurance claims, where every dimension indicates a business line of an insurer. We use the systemic expected shortfall (SES) and marginal expected shortfall (MES) defined with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) target level as the measurement of systemic risk. Assuming that all the claim sizes are pairwise asymptotically independent (PAI), we derive asymptotic formulas for the tail probabilities of discounted aggregate claims and the total loss, which hold uniformly for all time horizons. We further obtain the asymptotics of the above systemic risk measures. The main technical issues involve the treatment of uniform convergence in the dynamic time setting. Finally, we perform a detailed Monte Carlo study to validate our asymptotics and analyze the impact and sensitivity of key parameters in the asymptotic expressions both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>A stochastic volatility approximation for a tick-by-tick price model with mean-field interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a tick-by-tick model of price formation, in which buy and sell orders are modeled as self-exciting point processes (Hawkes process), similar to the one in [Hoffmann, Bacry, Delattre, Muzy, Modelling microstructure noise with mutually exciting point processes, Quantitative Finance, 2013] and [El Euch, Fukasawa, Rosenbaum, The microstructural foundations of leverage effect and rough volatility, Finance and Stochastics, 2018]. We adopt an agent based approach by studying the aggregation of a large number of these point processes, mutually interacting in a mean-field sense.
  The financial interpretation is that of an asset on which several labeled agents place buy and sell orders following these point processes, influencing the price. The mean-field interaction introduces positive correlations between order volumes coming from different agents that reflect features of real markets such as herd behavior and contagion. When the large scale limit of the aggregated asset price is computed, if parameters are set to a critical value, a singular phenomenon occurs: the aggregated model converges to a stochastic volatility model with leverage effect and faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process.
  The faster-than-linear mean reversion of the volatility process is supported by econometric evidence, and we have linked it in [Dai Pra, Pigato, Multi-scaling of moments in stochastic volatility models, Stochastic Processes and their Applications, 2015] to the observed multifractal behavior of assets prices and market indices. This seems connected to the Statistical Physics perspective that expects anomalous scaling properties to arise in the critical regime.</description>

Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics in a probability simplex, named probability manifolds. We call these manifolds finite-state generalized Wasserstein-$2$ spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, in which we derive the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian, and parallel transport, and compute the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. These include Levi-Civita connections from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction and sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows how inference is treated within the context of Eigenlogic projection operators in linear algebra. In Eigenlogic operators represent logical connectives, their eigenvalues the truth-values and the associated eigenvectors the logical models. By extension, a probabilistic interpretation is proposed using vectors outside the eigensystem of the Eigenlogic operators. The probability is calculated by the quantum mean value (Born rule) of the logical projection operators. We look here for possible connections between the Born rule in quantum mechanics and Bayes' theorem from probability theory and show that Eigenlogic offers an innovative approach to address the probabilistic version of logical inference (material implication) in a quantum context.</description>

      <title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of summary statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Free-energy variations for determinantal 2D plasmas with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gibbs equilibrium of a classical 2D Coulomb gas in the determinantal case = 2. The external potential is the sum of a quadratic term and the potential generated by individual charges pinned in several extended groups. This leads to an equilibrium measure (droplet) with flat density and macroscopic holes. We consider ''correlation energy'' (free energy minus its mean-field approximation) expansions, for large particle number . Under the assumptions that the holes are sufficiently small, separated, and far from the droplet's outer boundary, we prove that (i) the correlation energy up to order 1 is independent of the holes' locations and orientations, and (ii) the difference between the correlation energies of systems differing by their number of holes essentially consists of ``topological'' $O(\log N)$ and $O(1)$ terms.</description>

      <title>Kemeny's constant minimization for reversible Markov chains via structure-preserving perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Properties of Several Generalized-Constant Sequences, with Implications for ${\Gamma^{\left(n\right)}\left(1\right)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma = 0.577215...$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta = 0.596347...$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that at least one of them is transcendental. The two constants are related by a well-known equation of Hardy, equivalent to $\gamma + \delta/e = \mathrm{Ein}(1)$, which recently has been generalized to $\gamma^{(n)} + \delta^{(n)}/e = \eta^{(n)}$; $n \ge 0$ for sequences of constants $\gamma^{(n)}$, $\delta^{(n)}$, and $\eta^{(n)}$ (given respectively by raw, conditional, and partial moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution). Investigating the $\gamma^{(n)}$ through recurrence relations, we find that at least one of the pair {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)}$} and at least two of each of the sets {$\gamma,\gamma^{(2)},\gamma^{(3)},\gamma^{(4)}$}, {$\gamma,\gamma^{(3)},\gamma^{(4)},\ldots,\gamma^{(6)}$}, and {$\gamma,\gamma^{(4)},\gamma^{(5)},\ldots,\gamma^{(8)}$} are transcendental, implying analogous results for the sequence $\Gamma^{(n)}(1)=\left(-1\right)^{n}\gamma^{\left(n\right)}$. We then show, via a theorem of Shidlovskii, that the $\eta^{(n)}$ are algebraically independent, and therefore transcendental, for all $n \ge 0$, implying that at least one of each pair, {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e$} and {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}$}, and at least two of the triple {$\gamma^{(n)},\delta^{(n)}/e,\delta^{(n)}$}, are transcendental for all $n \ge 1$. Further analysis of the $\gamma^{(n)}$ and $\eta^{(n)}$ reveals that the values $\delta^{(n)}/e$ are transcendental infinitely often, with the density of the set of transcendental terms having asymptotic lower bound $1/2-o(1)$. Finally, we provide parallel results for the sequences $\tilde{\delta}^{(n)}$ and $\tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$ satisfying the "non-alternating analogue" equation $\gamma^{(n)} + \tilde{\delta}^{(n)}/e = \tilde{\eta}^{(n)}$.</description>
