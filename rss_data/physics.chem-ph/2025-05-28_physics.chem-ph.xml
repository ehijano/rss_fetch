      <title>Theoretical study on charge transfer properties of triphenylamino-ethynyl Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the regulation mechanisms of backbone topology (tri-/tetracyclic arenes), substitution positions, and functional groups on charge transport properties through molecular design of triphenylamine-ethynylene fused acene derivatives. By integrating Marcus charge transfer theory with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that sulfur-doped tricyclic arene backbones (benzodithiophene and anthracene) effectively suppress high-frequency vibrational modes reducing reorganization energy to 146.1 meV. Concurrent optimization of intermolecular $\pi$-$\pi$ slippage enhances 2D hole mobility. Notably, asymmetric charge transport pathways in 2,7-disubstituted pyrene(27DTEP) decrease transfer integrals by 34%, while 1,6-substitution (16DTEP)reconstructs HOMO orbital distribution and induces rotational stacking, boosting transfer integrals by 28% and improving mobility isotropy. We further propose a "backbone-functional group synergy" strategy, revealing that concentrated orbital localization on the backbone amplifies transfer integral gains, outweighing the 38% increase in reorganization energy and significantly enhancing mobility. These findings establish a theoretical framework and quantitative model for the rational design of high-mobility organic ultraviolet photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Quadrillion Determinant Barrier in Numerically Exact Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial scaling of configuration interaction (CI) has long restricted its applicability to only the simplest molecular systems. Here, we report the first numerically exact CI calculation exceeding one quadrillion ($10^{15}$) determinants, enabled by lossless categorical compression within the small-tensor-product distributed active space (STP-DAS) framework. As a demonstration, we converged the relativistic full CI (FCI) ground state of a magnesium atom involving over $10^{15}$ complex-valued 2-spinor determinants in under 8.6 hours (time-to-completion) using 1500 nodes, representing the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Additionally, we achieved $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build times of just 5 minutes for systems with approximately 150 billion complex-valued 2-spinor determinants using only a few compute nodes. Extensive benchmarks confirm that the method retains numerical exactness with drastically reduced resource demands. Compared to previous state-of-the-art FCI calculations, this work represents a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase in CI space, a 6-orders-of-magnitude increase in FLOP count, and a 6-orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational speed. By introducing a lossless, categorically compressed representation of the CI expansion vectors and reformulating the $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$-build accordingly, we eliminate memory bottlenecks associated with storing excitation lists and CI vectors while significantly reducing computational cost. A compression-compatible preconditioner further enhances performance by generating compressed CI expansion vectors throughout Davidson iterations. This work establishes a new computational frontier for numerically exact CI methods, enabling chemically and physically accurate simulations of strongly correlated, spin-orbit coupled systems previously thought to be beyond reach.</description>

      <title>The Cavity-Enhanced Spectroscopist's Guide to Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton chemistry has been hailed as a potential new route to direct molecular processes with electromagnetic fields. To make further strides, it is essential for the community to clarify which unusual polaritonic phenomena are true hallmarks of cavity quantum electrodynamics and which can be rationalized with classical optical physics. Here, we provide a tutorial perspective on the formation, spectroscopy, and behavior of polaritons using classical optics. Where possible, we draw connections to cavity-enhanced spectroscopy and recast open questions in terms that may be more familiar to the broader community of physical chemists.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Predicts Coherent Oscillatory Behavior in the Early-times of a Photoisomerization Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantum dynamics of a photoisomerization reaction employing a two-electronic-state three-vibrational-mode model of the 2-cis-penta-2,4-dieniminium cation (cis-PSB3). In particular, we address two main issues: the challenges encountered in properly converging quantum dynamics calculations, even when a reduced-dimensionality molecular model is used; the emergence of a coherent oscillatory behavior in the formation of the trans isomer upon photoexcitation of cis-PSB3. The two issues are strictly related, since only upon reliable convergence, the simulated dynamics is able to capture the large amplitude motion associated to the torsion around the reactive bond, typical of photoisomerizations, which is due to the large amount of kinetic energy acquired by the vibrational modes after light excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential. Simulations are carried out under a temperature ramp for determining all possible products. Using this methodology, reaction pathways of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are identified.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Data for More Efficient and Generalizable Learning: A Case Study in Disordered Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Kernel Ridge Regression for conformer ensembles made easy with Structured Orthogonal Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computationally efficient protocol for machine learning in chemical space using Boltzmann ensembles of conformers as input is proposed; the method is based on rewriting Kernel Ridge Regression expressions in terms of Structured Orthogonal Random Features, yielding physics-motivated trigonometric neural networks. The resulting method is tested on experimental datasets of oxidation potentials in acetonitrile and hydration energies, using several popular molecular representations to demonstrate the method's flexibility. Despite only using computationally cheap forcefield calculations for conformer generation, we observe systematic decrease of machine learning error with increased training set size in all cases, with experimental accuracy reached after training on hundreds of molecules and prediction errors being comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. We also present novel versions of Huber and LogCosh loss functions that made hyperparameter optimization of the new approach more convenient.</description>

      <title>PropMolFlow: Property-guided Molecule Generation with Geometry-Complete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecule generation is advancing rapidly in chemical discovery and drug design. Flow matching methods have recently set the state of the art (SOTA) in unconditional molecule generation, surpassing score-based diffusion models. However, diffusion models still lead in property-guided generation. In this work, we introduce PropMolFlow, a novel approach for property-guided molecule generation based on geometry-complete SE(3)-equivariant flow matching. Integrating five different property embedding methods with a Gaussian expansion of scalar properties, PropMolFlow outperforms previous SOTA diffusion models in conditional molecule generation across various properties while preserving the stability and validity of the generated molecules, consistent with its unconditional counterpart. Additionally, it enables faster inference with significantly fewer time steps compared to baseline models. We highlight the importance of validating the properties of generated molecules through DFT calculations performed at the same level of theory as the training data. Specifically, our analysis identifies properties that require DFT validation and others where a pretrained SE(3) geometric vector perceptron regressors provide sufficiently accurate predictions on generated molecules. Furthermore, we introduce a new property metric designed to assess the model's ability to propose molecules with underrepresented property values, assessing its capacity for out-of-distribution generalization. Our findings reveal shortcomings in existing structural metrics, which mistakenly validate open-shell molecules or molecules with invalid valence-charge configurations, underscoring the need for improved evaluation frameworks. Overall, this work paves the way for developing targeted property-guided generation methods, enhancing the design of molecular generative models for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>xChemAgents: Agentic AI for Explainable Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal graph neural networks has demonstrated that augmenting atomic XYZ geometries with textual chemical descriptors can enhance predictive accuracy across a range of electronic and thermodynamic properties. However, naively appending large sets of heterogeneous descriptors often degrades performance on tasks sensitive to molecular shape or symmetry, and undermines interpretability. xChemAgents proposes a cooperative agent framework that injects physics-aware reasoning into multimodal property prediction. xChemAgents comprises two language-model-based agents: a Selector, which adaptively identifies a sparse, weighted subset of descriptors relevant to each target, and provides a natural language rationale; and a Validator, which enforces physical constraints such as unit consistency and scaling laws through iterative dialogue. On standard benchmark datasets, xChemAgents achieves up to a 22\% reduction in mean absolute error over strong baselines, while producing faithful, human-interpretable explanations. Experiment results highlight the potential of cooperative, self-verifying agents to enhance both accuracy and transparency in foundation-model-driven materials science. The implementation and accompanying dataset are available anonymously at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/xChemAgents.</description>

      <title>The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of active suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active suspensions composed of self-propelled colloidal particles are considered. Their propulsion of is generated by chemical reactions occurring by heterogeneous catalysis and diffusiophoresis coupling the concentration gradients of reacting molecular species to the fluid velocity. By this mechanism, chemical free energy is transduced into mechanical motion. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of such active suspensions is developed by explicitly taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of active particles, which are the Eulerian angles specifying their orientation. Accordingly, the distribution function of colloidal particles is defined in the six-dimensional configuration space of their position and their orientation, which fully characterises polar, nematic, and higher orientational orders in the active system. The local Gibbs and Euler thermodynamic relations are expressed in terms of the colloidal distribution function, the dynamics of which is ruled by a six-dimensional local conservation equation. All the processes contributing to the entropy production rate are derived from the local conservation and kinetic equations for colloids, molecular species, mass, linear momentum, and energy, identifying their thermodynamic forces, also called affinities, and their dissipative current densities. The non-equilibrium constitutive relations are obtained using the Curie symmetry principle and the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations based on microreversibility. In this way, all the mechanochemical coupling coefficients are completely determined for isothermal, incompressible, dilute suspensions composed of spherical Janus particles on the basis of the interfacial properties between the fluid solution and the solid particles and chemohydrodynamics. The complete expression of the entropy production rate is established for such active systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrices and Phase-Space Distributions in Thermofield Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermofield dynamics (TFD) is a powerful framework to account for thermal effects in a wavefunction setting, and has been extensively used in physics and quantum optics. TFD relies on a duplicated state space and creates a correlated two-mode thermal state via a Bogoliubov transformation acting on the vacuum state. However, a very useful variant of TFD uses the vacuum state as initial condition and transfers the Bogoliubov transformation into the propagator. This variant, referred to here as the inverse Bogoliubov transformation (iBT) variant, has recently been applied to vibronic coupling problems and coupled-oscillator Hamiltonians in a chemistry context, where the method is combined with efficient tensor network methods for high-dimensional quantum propagation. In the iBT/TFD representation, the mode expectation values are clearly defined and easy to calculate, but the thermalized reduced particle distributions such as the reduced 1-particle densities or Wigner distributions are highly non-trivial due to the Bogoliubov back-transformation of the original thermal TFD wavefunction. Here we derive formal expressions for the reduced 1-particle density matrix (1-RDM) that uses the correlations between the real and tilde modes encoded in the associated reduced 2-particle density matrix (2-RDM). We apply this formalism to define the 1-RDM and the Wigner distributions in the special case of a thermal harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we discuss several approximate schemes that can be extended to higher-dimensional distributions. These methods are demonstrated for the thermal reduced 1-particle density of an anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Hammett-Inspired Product Baseline for Data-efficient $\Delta$-ML in Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-hungry machine learning methods have become a new standard to efficiently navigate chemical compound space for molecular and materials design and discovery. Due to the severe scarcity and cost of high-quality experimental or synthetic simulated training data, however, data-acquisition costs can be considerable. Relying on reasonably accurate approximate legacy baseline labels with low computational complexity represents one of the most effective strategies to curb data-needs, e.g.~through $\Delta$-, transfer-, or multi-fidelity learning. A surprisingly effective and data-efficient baseline model is presented in the form of a generic coarse-graining Hammett-Inspired Product (HIP) {\em Ansatz}, generalizing the empirical Hammett equation towards arbitrary systems and properties. Numerical evidence for the applicability of HIP includes solvation free energies of molecules, formation energies of quaternary elpasolite crystals, carbon adsorption energies on heterogeneous catalytic surfaces, HOMO-LUMO gaps of metallorganic complexes, activation energies for S$_\text{N}$2 reactions, and catalyst-substrate binding energies in cross-coupling reactions. After calibration on the same training sets, HIP yields an effective baseline for improved $\Delta$-machine learning models with superior data-efficiency when compared to previously introduced specialised domain-specific models.</description>

Abstract: Attosecond photoemission or photoionization delays are a unique probe of the structure and the electronic dynamics of matter. However, spectral congestion and spatial delocalization of valence electron wave functions set fundamental limits to the complexity of systems that can be studied and the information that can be retrieved, respectively. Using attosecond X-ray pulses from LCLS, we demonstrate the key advantages of measuring core-level delays: the photoelectron spectra remain atom-like, the measurements become element specific and the observed scattering dynamics originate from a point-like source. We exploit these unique features to reveal the effects of electronegativity and symmetry on attosecond scattering dynamics by measuring and calculating the photoionization delays between N-1s and C-1s core shells of a series of aromatic azabenzene molecules. Remarkably, the delays increase with the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule and reveal multiple resonances. We identify two previously unknown mechanisms regulating the associated attosecond dynamics, namely the enhanced confinement of the trapped wavefunction with increasing electronegativity of the atoms and the decrease of the coupling strength among the photoemitted partial waves with increasing symmetry. This study demonstrates the unique opportunities opened by measurements of core-level photoionization delays for unraveling attosecond electron dynamics in complex matter.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>

Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, has revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach, suggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency -- and that energy conservation can be learned during training. This work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, energy conservation is hard to learn, monitor, and correct for. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force prediction might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing -- rather than eliminating -- the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</description>

      <title>HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates via molecular linker. Existing methods fall into point cloud-free and point cloud-aware categories based on their use of fragments' 3D poses alongside their topologies in sampling the linker's topology. Point cloud-free models prioritize sample diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking fragments' spatial constraints, while point cloud-aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict spatial constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances point cloud-aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained point cloud-free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across point cloud-free and point cloud-aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of point cloud-free models into the point cloud-aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied drug optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular domains beyond imaging.</description>

      <title>Using Matrix-Free Tensor-Network Optimizations to Construct a Reduced-Scaling and Robust Second-Order M{\o}ller-Plesset Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the efficient combination of the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and tensor hyper-contraction (THC) approaches. We first present a novel low-cost CPD solver which leverages a precomputed THC factorization of an order-$4$ tensor to efficiently optimize the order-$4$ CPD with $\mathcal{O}(NR^2)$ scaling. With the matrix-free THC-based optimization strategy in hand we can: efficiently generate CPD factorizations of the order-4 two-electron integral tensors; and develop novel electronic structure methods which take advantage of both the THC and CPD approximations. Next, we investigate the application of a combined CPD and THC approximation of the Laplace transform (LT) second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) method. We exploit the ability to switch efficiently between the THC and CPD factorizations of the two electron integrals to reduce the computational complexity of the LT MP2 method while preserving the accuracy of the approach. Furthermore we take advantage of the robust fitting approximation to eliminate leading order error in the CPD approximated tensor networks. Finally, we show that modest values of THC and CPD rank preserve the accuracy of the LT MP2 method and that this CPD+THC LT MP2 strategy realizes a performance advantage over canonical LT MP2 in both computational wall-times and memory resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Separating orders of response in transient absorption and coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy by intensity variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretation of time-resolved spectroscopies such as transient absorption (TA) or two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy often relies on the perturbative description of light-matter interaction. In many cases the third order of nonlinear response is the leading and desired term. When pulse amplitudes are high, higher orders of light-matter interaction can both distort lineshapes and dynamics and provide valuable information. Here, we present a general procedure to separately measure the nonlinear response orders in both TA and 2D spectroscopies, using linear combinations of intensity-dependent spectra. We analyze the residual contamination and random errors and show how to choose optimal intensities to minimize the total error in the extracted orders. For an experimental demonstration, we separate the nonlinear orders in the 2D electronic spectroscopy of squaraine polymers up to 11$^{th}$ order.</description>

      <title>Correlated Terahertz phonon-ion interactions control ion conduction in a solid electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve collective phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of collective phonon-ion modes to Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes can lead to a three order of magnitude increase in the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of single vibrational modes in the lattice associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving the TiO6 rocking via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the normalized impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons that are associated with heating. These findings provide new insights into phonon-coupled ion migration mechanisms and material design rules for ion conductors and opto-ionic materials.</description>

      <title>Advancing Molecular Machine Learning Representations with Stereoelectronics-Infused Molecular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation is a critical element in our understanding of the physical world and the foundation for modern molecular machine learning. Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects, enhancing expressivity and interpretability. Learning to predict the stereoelectronics-infused representation with a tailored double graph neural network workflow enables its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task without expensive quantum chemical calculations. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic information significantly improves the performance of message-passing 2D machine learning models for molecular property prediction. We show that the learned representations trained on small molecules can accurately extrapolate to much larger molecular structures, yielding chemical insight into orbital interactions for previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design. Finally, we have developed a web application (simg.cheme.cmu.edu) where users can rapidly explore stereoelectronic information for their own molecular systems.</description>

      <title>A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. The manifestation of this braided chain in the lattice model points to the potential emergence of a shift from cooperative capture to that of a phase transition. In addition to the physical insights, this work may serve as a launching off point for further work on this and related materials.</description>

      <title>GeLLMO: Generalizing Large Language Models for Multi-property Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements, most computational methods for molecule optimization are constrained to single- or double-property optimization tasks and suffer from poor scalability and generalizability to novel optimization tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs' potential for molecule optimization, we introduce MuMOInstruct, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on complex multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMOs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that GeLLMOs consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. GeLLMOs also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of GeLLMOs as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. MuMOInstruct, models, and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study benchmarks the GFN family of semiempirical methods (GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF) against density functional theory (DFT) for the evaluation of optimized molecular geometries and electronic properties of small organic semiconductor molecules. This work offers a systematic assessment of these computationally efficient quantum chemical methods and their accuracy-cost profiles when applied to a challenging class of systems, characterized, for instance, by extended $\pi$-conjugation, conformational flexibility, and sensitivity of properties to subtle structural changes. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, and angles, while electronic property prediction is assessed via HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, with the choice of method depending on accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</description>
