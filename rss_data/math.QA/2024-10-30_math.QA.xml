      <title>Braid group action and quantum affine superalgebra for type $\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of the quantum affine superalgebra associated with the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)$ for $m\geqslant 1$. The Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation for this algebra, denoted as $U_q[\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)^{(1)}]$, was originally introduced by H. Yamane. We provide the definition of the Drinfeld presentation $\mathcal{U}_q[\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)^{(1)}]$. To establish the isomorphism between the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation and the Drinfeld presentation of the quantum affine superalgebra for type $\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)$, we introduce a braid group action to define quantum root vectors of quantum superalgebras. Specifically, we present an efficient method for verifying the isomorphism between two presentations of the quantum affine superalgebra associated with the type $\mathfrak{osp}(2m+1|2n)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems: Mathematical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum spread spectrum code division multiple access (QCDMA) communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread spectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the principles of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single photon states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this paper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Superselection sectors for posets of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a commutant-closed collection of von Neumann algebras acting on a common Hilbert space indexed by a poset with an order-reversing involution. We give simple geometric axioms for the poset which allow us to construct a braided tensor category of superselection sectors analogous to the construction of Gabbiani and Fr\"ohlich for conformal nets. For cones in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we weaken our conditions to a bounded spread version of Haag duality and obtain similar results. We show that intertwined nets of algebras have isomorphic braided tensor categories of superselection sectors. Finally, we show that the categories constructed here are equivalent to those constructed by Naaijkens and Ogata for certain 2D quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Genus $g$ Zhu Recursion for Vertex Operator Algebras and Their Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe Zhu recursion for a vertex operator algebra (VOA) and its modules on a genus $g$ Riemann surface in the Schottky uniformisation. We show that $n$-point (intertwiner) correlation functions are written as linear combinations of $(n-1)$-point functions with universal coefficients given by derivatives of the differential of the third kind, the Bers quasiform and certain holomorphic forms. We use this formula to describe conformal Ward identities framed in terms of a canonical differential operator which acts with respect to the Schottky moduli and to the insertion points of the $n$-point function. We consider the generalised Heisenberg VOA and determine all its correlation functions by Zhu recursion. We also use Zhu recursion to derive linear partial differential equations for the Heisenberg VOA partition function and various structures such as the bidifferential of the second kind, holomorphic $1$-forms, the prime form and the period matrix. Finally, we compute the genus $g$ partition function for any rational Euclidean lattice generalised VOA.</description>

      <title>Actions of Hopf-Ore Extensions of Group Algebras on Path Algebras of Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the (filtered) Hopf actions of Hopf-Ore extensions of group algebras on path algebras of quivers, extending results in several other works from special cases to this general setting. Having done this for general Hopf-Ore extensions of group algebras, we demonstrate application by specializing our main result to certain Hopf-Ore extensions including some Noetherian prime Hopf algebras of GK-dimension one and two.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of singular Borcherds products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $l\geq 3$ and $F$ be a modular form of weight $l/2-1$ on $\mathrm{O}(l,2)$ which vanishes only on rational quadratic divisors. We prove that $F$ has only simple zeros and that $F$ is anti-invariant under every reflection fixing a quadratic divisor in the zeros of $F$. In particular, $F$ is a reflective modular form. As a corollary, the existence of $F$ leads to $l\leq 20$ or $l=26$, in which case $F$ equals the Borcherds form on $\mathrm{II}_{26,2}$. This answers a question posed by Borcherds in 1995.</description>

      <title>Line bundles on Contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ via Conformal Block Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using representations of vertex operator algebras, we describe the line bundles on a wide range of contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$, the moduli space of stable $n$-pointed rational curves, by proving a stronger version of the contraction theorem for these morphisms. These include the celebrated constructions of Kapranov, Keel, and Knudsen. Our main result suggests that while many so-called F-curves are not $K_X$-negative, they exhibit behavior similar to $K_X$-negative curves. This reveals for instance, a distinguished property of Knudsen's construction $f_{\text{Knu}}:\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}\to \overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}\times_{\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-2}}\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}$, allowing for the classification of all possible factorizations of $f_{\text{Knu}}$, as well as further applications, and generalizations.</description>

      <title>Rationality of Lorentzian Lattice CFTs And The Associated Modular Tensor Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the irreducible modules of a rational Lorentzian lattice vertex operator algebra (LLVOA) based on an even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice $\Lambda\subset\mathbb{R}^{m,n}$ of signature $(m,n)$. We show that the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible modules of the LLVOA are in one-to-one correspondence with the equivalence classes $\Lambda_0^\circ/\Lambda_0$ for a certain subset $\Lambda_0^\circ\subset\mathbb{R}^{m,n}$ and a full rank sublattice $\Lambda_0\subset\Lambda$. We also classify the intertwining operators between the modules and calculate the fusion rules. We then describe the standard construction of modular tensor category (MTC) associated to rational LLCFTs. We explicitly construct the modular data and braiding and fusing matrices for the MTC. As a concrete example, we show that the LLCFT based on a certain even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice of signature $(m, n)$, with $m$ even, realizes the $D(m \bmod 8)$ level 1 Kac-Moody MTC.</description>
