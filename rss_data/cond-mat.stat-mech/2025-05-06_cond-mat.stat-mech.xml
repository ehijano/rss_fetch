      <title>Super-Universal Behavior of Outliers Diffusing in a Space-Time Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I characterize the extreme location and extreme first passage time of a system of $N$ particles independently diffusing in a space-time random environment. I show these extreme statistics are governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and derive their mean and variance. I find the scalings of the statistics depend on the moments of the environment. Each scaling regime forms a universality class which is controlled by the lowest order moment which exhibits random fluctuations. When the first moment is random, the environment plays the role of a random velocity field. When the first moment is fixed but the second moment is random, the environment manifests as fluctuations in the diffusion coefficient. As each higher moment is fixed, the next moment determines the scaling behavior. Since each scaling regime forms a universality class, this model for diffusion forms a super-universality class. I confirm my theoretical predictions using numerics for a wide class of underlying environments.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Statistical Mechanics and Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first focus on the mathematical structure of the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model. In the Clifford algebraic representation, many internal factors exist in the transfer matrices of the 3D Ising model, which are ascribed to the topology of the 3D space and the many-body interactions of spins. They result in the nonlocality, the nontrivial topological structure, as well as the long-range entanglement between spins in the 3D Ising model. We review briefly the exact solution of the ferromagnetic 3D Ising model at the zero magnetic field, which was derived in our previous work. Then, the framework of topological quantum statistical mechanics is established, with respect to the mathematical aspects (topology, algebra, and geometry) and physical features (the contribution of topology to physics, Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, time average, ensemble average, and quantum mechanical average). This is accomplished by generalizations of our findings and observations in the 3D Ising models. Finally, the results are generalized to topological quantum field theories, in consideration of relationships between quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theories. It is found that these theories must be set up within the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, and the ergodic hypothesis is violated at the finite temperature. It is necessary to account the time average of the ensemble average and the quantum mechanical average in the topological quantum statistical mechanics and to introduce the parameter space of complex time (and complex temperature) in the topological quantum field theories. We find that a topological phase transition occurs near the infinite temperature (or the zero temperature) in models in the topological quantum statistical mechanics and the topological quantum field theories, which visualizes a symmetrical breaking of time inverse symmetry.</description>

      <title>Impurity dynamics in a zero-temperature gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If energy is suddenly released in a localized region of space uniformly filled with identical stationary hard spheres of radii $a$, the outcome is a blast with an asymptotically spherical shock wave separating moving and stationary hard spheres. The radius of the region filled with the moving spheres grows as $R\sim (E t^2/n_\infty)^{1/(d+2)}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension, $n_\infty$ the number density of stationary spheres and $E$ is the total energy injected. The simplest way to inject energy is to kick a few `impurity' particles. Using hydrodynamics and kinetic theory, we argue that the typical displacement of an impurity scales as $R_{\rm imp} \sim \lambda (R/\lambda)^{(4+3d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, where $\lambda\sim 1/(n_\infty a^{d-1})$ is the mean-free path in the initial state. The number of collisions experienced by each impurity is $(R/\lambda)^{(8+2d^2)/(8+3d^2)}$, while its average speed decreases as $t^{-d(8-2d+3d^2)/[(2+d)(8+3d^2)]}$. In $2D$, the predictions for impurity displacement, collision numbers, and speed are $t^{2/5},~t^{2/5}$ and $t^{-2/5}$, respectively. These predictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Half-Ice, Half-Fire Driven Ultranarrow Phase Crossover in 1D Decorated q-State Potts Ferrimagnets: An AI-Co-Led Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenAI's reasoning model o3-mini-high was used to carry out an exact analytic study of one-dimensional ferrimagnetic decorated $q$-state Potts models. We demonstrate that the finite-temperature ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), driven by a hidden "half-ice, half-fire" state in the $q=2$ Potts (Ising) model, persists for $q&gt;2$. We identify novel features for $q&gt;2$, including the dome structure in the field-temperature phase diagram and for large $q$ a secondary high-temperature UNPC to the fully disordered paramagnetic state. The ice-fire mechanism of spin flipping can be applied to higher-dimensional Potts models. These results establish a versatile framework for engineering controlled fast state-flipping switches in low-dimensional systems. Our nine-level AI-contribution rating assigns AI the meritorious status of AI-co-led discovery in this work.</description>

      <title>Characterizing spin ordering via maximal row correlation in classical spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An order parameter, termed the maximal row correlation, is proposed for classical spin systems. Monte Carlo simulations on various Potts models suggest that this order parameter is applicable to a broad range of spin systems, including those defined on irregular lattices, systems with frustration, and systems exhibiting partial orders, provided some degree of spin ordering is present. This approach offers a unified framework for investigating phase transitions in such complex systems. The associated critical exponents are estimated via finite-size scaling analysis and show good agreement with established values.</description>

      <title>Compositional disorder in a multicomponent non-reciprocal mixture: stability and patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Krylov space during finite precision Lanczos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm, introduced by Cornelius Lanczos, has been known for a long time and is widely used in computational physics. While often employed to approximate extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectores of an operator, recently interest in the sequence of basis vectors produced by the algorithm rose in the context of Krylov complexity. Although it is generally accepted and partially proven that the procedure is numerically stable for approximating the eigenvalues, there are numerical problems when investigating the Krylov basis constructed via the Lanczos procedure. In this paper, we show that loss of orthogonality and the attempt of reorthoganalization fall short of understanding and addressing the problem. Instead, the numerical sequence of eigenvectors in finite precision arithmetic escapes the true vector space spanned by the exact Lanczos vectors. This poses the real threat to an interpretation in view of the operator growth hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Particles, trajectories and diffusion: random walks in cooling granular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-square displacement (MSD) of a tracer particle diffusing in a granular gas of inelastic hard spheres under homogeneous cooling state (HCS). Tracer and granular gas particles are in general mechanically different. Our approach uses a series representation of the MSD where the $k$-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product $\langle \mathbf{r}_1\cdot\mathbf{r}_k \rangle$, with $\mathbf{r}_i$ denoting the displacements of the tracer between successive collisions. We find that this series approximates a geometric series with the ratio $\Omega$. We derive an explicit analytical expression of $\Omega$ for granular gases in three dimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the numerical results obtained from the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our comparison covers a wide range of masses, sizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we find that the MSD per collision is simply given by the mean-square free path of the particle divided by $1-\Omega$. The analytical expression for the MSD derived here is compared with DSMC data and with the first- and second-Sonine approximations to the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltzmann equation. Surprisingly, despite their simplicity, our results outperforms the predictions of the first-Sonine approximation to the MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonine approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.</description>

      <title>Driven Non-Unitary Dynamics of Quantum Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between unitary and non-unitary driven many-body dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory (CFT). By formulating a coherent state approach, we demonstrate that the growth of entanglement entropy and energy can be found analytically for a class of non-unitary driven CFTs, where the evolution alternates between real and imaginary time evolution, the latter corresponding to postselected weak measurements. We find that non-unitary evolution leads to the emergence of steady states at infinite times for the cases of periodic, quasiperiodic, and random drives. In a special class of drives, for mixed initial states, we uncover purification phase transitions that arise as a result of the competition between unitary evolution and weak measurements. We compare the CFT evolution with the corresponding non-unitary dynamics of critical lattice models, finding remarkable agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From an entropy-based formulation of the first law of thermodynamics in the quantum regime, we investigate the performance of Otto-like and Carnot-like engines for a single-qubit working medium. Within this framework, the first law includes an additional contribution -- coherence work -- that quantifies the energetic cost of deviating the quantum trajectory from its natural unitary evolution. We focus on the efficiency of the heat-to-coherence work conversion and show that the Carnot cycle achieves the classical Carnot efficiency, while the performance of the Otto cycle is upper-bounded by the Carnot efficiency corresponding to the extreme temperatures of the cycle. We identify entropy generation during the isochoric stages as the key source of irreversibility limiting the Otto cycle's efficiency.</description>

      <title>A note on the asymptotic uniformity of Markov chains with random rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding "jump chain," i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafa\"i (2012) under certain assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condensation in linear wedges formed by semi-infinite walls is a well-established critical phenomenon characterized by the continuous growth of an adsorbed liquid layer as bulk two-phase coexistence is approached. In this study, we investigate condensation in finite-length wedges open at both ends, demonstrating that the process becomes first-order. The open boundaries and finite geometry induce a remarkably rich phase behavior of the confined fluid, exhibiting three distinct types of condensation, reentrant phenomena, and continuous higher-order transitions between condensation states. Through a detailed macroscopic analysis, we derive the conditions for each type of condensation, classify the global phase diagrams, and explore asymptotic behavior in specific limiting cases. The asymptotic predictions are confirmed by a detailed comparison with the numerical solutions of the governing equations.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi Markov length in one-dimensional non-trivial mixed state phases and mixed state phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and classifying non-trivial mixed states and mixed state phase transitions are some of the most important current issues in condensed matter and quantum information. In this study, we investigate some non-trivial mixed states and phase transitions between them by using the second R\'{e}nyi conditional mutual information (CMI). The CMI can measure mixed state ``gap'', estimated by the exponential decay rate of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI under a tripartition of system, which provides the second R\'{e}nyi version of the Markov length. We introduce an efficient numerical scheme for the calculation of the second R\'{e}nyi CMI based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism, and study the classification of non-trivial mixed states and the emergence of mixed state phase transitions for (i) the cluster model under odd-site local $Z$ decoherence and (ii) transverse field Ising model under both $ZZ$ and $X$ decoherence. The second R\'{e}nyi CMI is a powerful measure to study non-trivial mixed ``gapped" quantum matters and mixed phase transitions. In addition to this, the present study shows that the second R\'{e}nyi CMI exhibits specific behavior for the transition to strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Molecular-sized bubbles in a liquid: free energy of formation beyond the capillarity approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transient bubbles that spontaneously appear in a simple liquid using molecular simulations. The objective is to deduce the free-energy of formation of the bubbles $W(s)$ from the bubble size distribution $p(s)$ through the hypothesis of a Boltzmann distribution: $W(s) = -kT \ln p(s)$. The bubbles are detected and characterized using a method based on a grid superimposed on the liquid, efficient for bubbles larger than the grid mesh. We first investigate how the results are affected by the mesh choice, and show that using several mesh values allows to detect bubbles in a wide range of sizes with minimal computing cost. The free-energy of formation of a bubble can then be deduced for a large range of sizes, with particular emphasis in the region of vanishing bubbles scarcely investigated in previous works. We first show that the usual Boltzmann relation has to be modified when the bubble size is characterized by its volume. In particular, the bubble volume distribution diverges for a vanishing bubble, which should be taken into account before calculating its free-energy of formation from the above formula. An analytical expansion, valid for any interacting spherical molecules, confirms this observation. We then show that the capillarity approximation fails for small bubbles: an extra contribution, linear with the bubble radius, has to be added to the usual quadratic (surface) and cubic (volume) contributions to the free-energy. This extra term most probably relates to the irregular shape of the tiny bubbles.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of collective patterns modulated by non-reciprocal interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study memoryless active particles that navigate using visual information. Particle perception is limited by a field of view. As the degree of non-reciprocity in interactions is varied, we can observe the emergence of a zoology of complex collective motion patterns that exhibit significantly different topologies and transport properties. Nematic closed filaments in the form of rings move as chiral active particles. Closed polar filaments with one singular topological point move ballistically, while those with two singular topological points rotate. Open polar filaments behave as persistent random walks. Furthermore, by changing the size of the field of view, we explore the metamorphic process that transforms one structure into another, finding that the process is non-reversible and presents strong hysteric effects. The analysis sheds light on the physics of single-species active particles with non-reciprocal interactions, providing evidence that topological and transport properties are closely related.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum non-thermodynamic phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to an interesting discovery [1-3]: With locally nonchaotic barriers, as Boltzmann's H-theorem is inapplicable, there exist nontrivial non-thermodynamic systems that can produce useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The previous analyses used classical mechanical models. In the current investigation, the study is extended to quantum mechanics. First, we reiterate that the Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Bose-Einstein distribution are compatible with the generalized Maxwell's relations, which demonstrates the general robustness of the framework of quantum statistical mechanics. Next, we analyze a set of simple-step scattering problems. When the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, a bound state inherently follows the second law of thermodynamics, while a scattering state may not. The root cause is associated with the nonlocal nature of the wave function. It implies that the non-thermodynamic phenomena favor unquantized energy and localized wave packets, exhibiting a tendency to occur in "semiclassical" setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)&lt;0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M&lt;0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)&gt;0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.</description>

Abstract: Complex dynamics when occurring autonomously, i.e. without external driving, is usually associated with everyday length scales and classical physics, e.g. living organisms. This dynamics is \emph{not} quantum coherent. Quantum coherent dynamics is, by contrast, assumed to be either simple periodic oscillation in particular when autonomous, e.g. spin precession, or random quantum fluctuations. Combining autonomous complex and quantum coherent dynamics on microscopic length-scales could allow for novel coherent quantum machines working without external time-dependent driving. Motivated by this, here we provide an exact theoretical condition for a system to display complex quantum coherent dynamics on both microscopic and macroscopic length scales that we call a \emph{dynamical quantum algebraic thread} (D-QAT). Due to D-QATs our autonomous quantum coherent dynamics is robust to realistic imperfections (including low-doped disorder) and present for generic initial states, allowing for potential realisations in experiments. We give an example of a \emph{spin lace} model structurally similar to magnetic azurite and certain recently experimentally realized large single-molecular magnets with long coherence times. Our work opens the possibility for many potential applications including ultra-dense storage and manipulation of quantum memories, creating \emph{giant} quantum coherent qubits, or microscopic quantum mechanism perform complicated motion.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation without dissipation: Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic sampling algorithms such as Langevin Monte Carlo are inspired by physical systems in a heat bath. Their equilibrium distribution is the canonical ensemble given by a prescribed target distribution, so they must balance fluctuation and dissipation as dictated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In contrast to the common belief, we show that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not required because only the configuration space distribution, and not the full phase space distribution, needs to be canonical. We propose a continuous-time Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) as a dissipation-free system of stochastic differential equations (SDE). We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and show that the stationary distribution is the microcanonical ensemble with the desired canonical distribution on configuration space. We prove that MCLMC is ergodic for any nonzero amount of stochasticity, and for smooth, convex potentials, the expectation values converge exponentially fast. Furthermore, the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion separately preserve the stationary distribution. This uncommon property is attractive for practical implementations as it implies that the drift-diffusion discretization schemes are bias-free, so the only source of bias is the discretization of the deterministic dynamics. We applied MCLMC on a lattice $\phi^4$ model, where Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is currently the state-of-the-art integrator. For the same accuracy, MCLMC converges 12 times faster than HMC on an $8\times8$ lattice. On a $64\times64$ lattice, it is already 32 times faster. The trend is expected to persist to larger lattices, which are of particular interest, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Mutual distribution of two partial solutions in 1D localization: new information on the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mutual distribution of two linearly independent solutions y_1(x) and y_2(x) of the 1D Schroedinger equation with a random potential. Since individual distributions of $y_1$ and $y_2$ are log-normal, it is naturally to suggest that their mutual distribution is also log-normal. Such hypothesis is confirmed in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands, but failed near the initial band edge. The mechanism of deviations from the log-normal form is elucidated, and the first correction to it is calculated. The latter allows to demonstrate broadening of the spectral lines in the universal conductance fluctuations. A lot of new information is obtained on the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), where \psi is a combined phase entering the evolution equations. According to the previous publications, this transition is related with appearance of the imaginary part of \psi at a certain energy E_0, and is not accompanied by singularities in the system resistance. The real sense of this transition consists in the change of configuration of four Lyapunov exponents, which determine the general solution: there are two pairs of complex-conjugated exponents for E&gt;E_0, while for E&lt;E_0 all exponents become real. Realization of two different configurations is confirmed for energies in the deep of the allowed and forbidden bands; it proves the existence of the singular point E_0 at the formal level. The phase transition can be observed in optical systems, tracing the sign of the field in a wave, when the coordinate is changed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way. The method is also illustrated using the Transverse-Field Ising model.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width approximately proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low-scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>
