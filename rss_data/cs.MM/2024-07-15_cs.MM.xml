      <title>User Digital Twin-Driven Video Streaming for Customized Preferences and Adaptive Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multimedia services, video streaming has become increasingly prevalent, demanding innovative solutions to enhance user experience and system efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates user digital twins-a dynamic digital representation of a user's preferences and behaviors-with traditional video streaming systems. We explore the potential of this integration to dynamically adjust video preferences and optimize transcoding processes according to real-time data. The methodology leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to continuously update the user's digital twin, which in turn informs the transcoding service to adapt video parameters for optimal quality and minimal buffering. Experimental results show that our approach not only improves the personalization of content delivery but also significantly enhances the overall efficiency of video streaming services by reducing bandwidth usage and improving video playback quality. The implications of such advancements suggest a shift towards more adaptive, user-centric multimedia services, potentially transforming how video content is consumed and delivered.</description>

      <title>TOP:A New Target-Audience Oriented Content Paraphrase Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems usually recommend the existing contents to different users. However, in comparison to static recommendation methods, a recommendation logic that dynamically adjusts based on user interest preferences may potentially attract a larger user base. Thus, we consider paraphrasing existing content based on the interests of the users to modify the content to better align with the preferences of users. In this paper, we propose a new task named Target-Audience Oriented Content Paraphrase aims to generate more customized contents for the target audience. We introduce the task definition and the corresponding framework for the proposed task and the creation of the corresponding datasets. We utilize the Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) to accomplish the base implementation of the TOP framework and provide the referential baseline results for the proposed task.</description>

      <title>Multi-source Knowledge Enhanced Graph Attention Networks for Multimodal Fact Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal fact verification is an under-explored and emerging field that has gained increasing attention in recent years. The goal is to assess the veracity of claims that involve multiple modalities by analyzing the retrieved evidence. The main challenge in this area is to effectively fuse features from different modalities to learn meaningful multimodal representations. To this end, we propose a novel model named Multi-Source Knowledge-enhanced Graph Attention Network (MultiKE-GAT). MultiKE-GAT introduces external multimodal knowledge from different sources and constructs a heterogeneous graph to capture complex cross-modal and cross-source interactions. We exploit a Knowledge-aware Graph Fusion (KGF) module to learn knowledge-enhanced representations for each claim and evidence and eliminate inconsistencies and noises introduced by redundant entities. Experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other comparison methods, showing the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing and Re-learning for Balanced Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the imbalanced multimodal learning problem, where models prefer the training of specific modalities, existing methods propose to control the training of uni-modal encoders from different perspectives, taking the inter-modal performance discrepancy as the basis. However, the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity is ignored. The scarcely informative modalities can be recognized as ``worse-learnt'' ones, which could force the model to memorize more noise, counterproductively affecting the multimodal model ability. Moreover, the current modality modulation methods narrowly concentrate on selected worse-learnt modalities, even suppressing the training of others. Hence, it is essential to consider the intrinsic limitation of modality capacity and take all modalities into account during balancing. To this end, we propose the Diagnosing \&amp; Re-learning method. The learning state of each modality is firstly estimated based on the separability of its uni-modal representation space, and then used to softly re-initialize the corresponding uni-modal encoder. In this way, the over-emphasizing of scarcely informative modalities is avoided. In addition, encoders of worse-learnt modalities are enhanced, simultaneously avoiding the over-training of other modalities. Accordingly, multimodal learning is effectively balanced and enhanced. Experiments covering multiple types of modalities and multimodal frameworks demonstrate the superior performance of our simple-yet-effective method for balanced multimodal learning. The source code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/Diagnosing_Relearning_ECCV2024}.</description>

      <title>TemporalStory: Enhancing Consistency in Story Visualization using Spatial-Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Story visualization presents a challenging task in text-to-image generation, requiring not only the rendering of visual details from text prompt but also ensuring consistency across images. Recently, most approaches address inconsistency problem using an auto-regressive manner conditioned on previous image-sentence pairs. However, they overlook the fact that story context is dispersed across all sentences. The auto-regressive approach fails to encode information from susequent image-sentence pairs, thus unable to capture the entirety of the story context. To address this, we introduce TemporalStory, leveraging Spatial-Temporal attention to model complex spatial and temporal dependencies in images, enabling the generation of coherent images based on a given storyline. In order to better understand the storyline context, we introduce a text adapter capable of integrating information from other sentences into the embedding of the current sentence. Additionally, to utilize scene changes between story images as guidance for the model, we propose the StoryFlow Adapter to measure the degree of change between images. Through extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, PororoSV and FlintstonesSV, our TemporalStory outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in both story visualization and story continuation tasks.</description>

      <title>IoT-LM: Large Multisensory Language Models for the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) network integrating billions of smart physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and communication technologies is a critical and rapidly expanding component of our modern world. The IoT ecosystem provides a rich source of real-world modalities such as motion, thermal, geolocation, imaging, depth, sensors, and audio to recognize the states of humans and physical objects. Machine learning presents a rich opportunity to automatically process IoT data at scale, enabling efficient inference for understanding human wellbeing, controlling physical devices, and interconnecting smart cities. To realize this potential, we introduce IoT-LM, an open-source large multisensory language model tailored for the IoT ecosystem. IoT-LM is enabled by two technical contributions: the first is MultiIoT, the most expansive unified IoT dataset to date, encompassing over 1.15 million samples from 12 modalities and 8 tasks prepared for multisensory pre-training and instruction-tuning. The second is a new multisensory multitask adapter layer to condition pre-trained large language models on multisensory IoT data. Not only does IoT-LM yield substantial improvements on 8 supervised IoT classification tasks, but it also demonstrates new interactive question-answering, reasoning, and dialog capabilities conditioned on IoT sensors. We release IoT-LM's data sources and new multisensory language modeling framework.</description>

      <title>LeRF: Learning Resampling Function for Adaptive and Efficient Image Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image resampling is a basic technique that is widely employed in daily applications, such as camera photo editing. Recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have made impressive progress in performance by introducing learned data priors. Still, these methods are not the perfect substitute for interpolation, due to the drawbacks in efficiency and versatility. In this work, we propose a novel method of Learning Resampling Function (termed LeRF), which takes advantage of both the structural priors learned by DNNs and the locally continuous assumption of interpolation. Specifically, LeRF assigns spatially varying resampling functions to input image pixels and learns to predict the hyper-parameters that determine the shapes of these resampling functions with a neural network. Based on the formulation of LeRF, we develop a family of models, including both efficiency-orientated and performance-orientated ones. To achieve interpolation-level efficiency, we adopt look-up tables (LUTs) to accelerate the inference of the learned neural network. Furthermore, we design a directional ensemble strategy and edge-sensitive indexing patterns to better capture local structures. On the other hand, to obtain DNN-level performance, we propose an extension of LeRF to enable it in cooperation with pre-trained upsampling models for cascaded resampling. Extensive experiments show that the efficiency-orientated version of LeRF runs as fast as interpolation, generalizes well to arbitrary transformations, and outperforms interpolation significantly, e.g., up to 3dB PSNR gain over Bicubic for x2 upsampling on Manga109. Besides, the performance-orientated version of LeRF reaches comparable performance with existing DNNs at much higher efficiency, e.g., less than 25% running time on a desktop GPU.</description>

      <title>BandControlNet: Parallel Transformers-based Steerable Popular Music Generation with Fine-Grained Spatiotemporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable music generation promotes the interaction between humans and composition systems by projecting the users' intent on their desired music. The challenge of introducing controllability is an increasingly important issue in the symbolic music generation field. When building controllable generative popular multi-instrument music systems, two main challenges typically present themselves, namely weak controllability and poor music quality. To address these issues, we first propose spatiotemporal features as powerful and fine-grained controls to enhance the controllability of the generative model. In addition, an efficient music representation called REMI_Track is designed to convert multitrack music into multiple parallel music sequences and shorten the sequence length of each track with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) techniques. Subsequently, we release BandControlNet, a conditional model based on parallel Transformers, to tackle the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality music samples that are conditioned to the given spatiotemporal control features. More concretely, the two specially designed modules of BandControlNet, namely structure-enhanced self-attention (SE-SA) and Cross-Track Transformer (CTT), are utilized to strengthen the resulting musical structure and inter-track harmony modeling respectively. Experimental results tested on two popular music datasets of different lengths demonstrate that the proposed BandControlNet outperforms other conditional music generation models on most objective metrics in terms of fidelity and inference speed and shows great robustness in generating long music samples. The subjective evaluations show BandControlNet trained on short datasets can generate music with comparable quality to state-of-the-art models, while outperforming them significantly using longer datasets.</description>

      <title>When Synthetic Traces Hide Real Content: Analysis of Stable Diffusion Image Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, methods for producing highly realistic synthetic images have significantly advanced, allowing the creation of high-quality images from text prompts that describe the desired content. Even more impressively, Stable Diffusion (SD) models now provide users with the option of creating synthetic images in an image-to-image translation fashion, modifying images in the latent space of advanced autoencoders. This striking evolution, however, brings an alarming consequence: it is possible to pass an image through SD autoencoders to reproduce a synthetic copy of the image with high realism and almost no visual artifacts. This process, known as SD image laundering, can transform real images into lookalike synthetic ones and risks complicating forensic analysis for content authenticity verification. Our paper investigates the forensic implications of image laundering, revealing a serious potential to obscure traces of real content, including sensitive and harmful materials that could be mistakenly classified as synthetic, thereby undermining the protection of individuals depicted. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage detection pipeline that effectively differentiates between pristine, laundered, and fully synthetic images (those generated from text prompts), showing robustness across various conditions. Finally, we highlight another alarming property of image laundering, which appears to mask the unique artifacts exploited by forensic detectors to solve the camera model identification task, strongly undermining their performance. Our experimental code is available at https://github.com/polimi-ispl/synthetic-image-detection.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed.</description>

      <title>ALMol: Aligned Language-Molecule Translation LLMs through Offline Preference Contrastive Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersection is an area of active research that aims to accelerate scientific discovery. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However, challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem, particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context, we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation, which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects, we conduct experiments using only 10% of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 32% improvement compared to counterpart models. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.</description>

      <title>Improving Speech Enhancement by Integrating Inter-Channel and Band Features with Dual-branch Conformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer have been demonstrated to efficaciously capture time-frequency (T-F) information on spectrogram. However, the correlation of each channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each channel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels contains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations. To fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named channel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively explores the long range time and frequency correlations among different channels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency information. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset demonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the significance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior performance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.</description>
