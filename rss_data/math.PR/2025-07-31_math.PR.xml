      <title>Limits of biconditioned Bienayme-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of a Bienayme-Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have a large number of vertices and either a fixed number of leaves or a fixed number of internal nodes. The first biconditioning gives a universal result with respect to the offspring distribution. In contrast, the second case leads to a variety of limiting behaviors, ranging from condensation phenomena to more elongated tree structures, depending on the properties of the offspring distribution. To prove these results, we use tools from conditioned random walk theory and from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Regularity and propagation of chaos for conditional McKean-Vlasov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rate of propagation of chaos for a McKean--Vlasov equation with conditional expectation terms in the drift. We use a (regularized) Nadaraya--Watson estimator at a particle level to approximate the conditional expectations; we then combine relative entropy methods in the spirit of Jabin and Wang (2018) with information theoretic inequalities to obtain the result. The nonparametric nature of the problem requires higher regularity for the density of the McKean--Vlasov limit, which we obtain with a bootstrap argument and energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Effective Radius of a Discrete Moving Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discrete space-time stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) model to describe the dynamics of a weakly self-avoiding polymer with intrinsic length $J$. By introducing a penalty factor tailored to the discrete setting, we establish that the polymer's root mean squared radius scales linearly with $J$. This scaling behavior differs from the law derived by Mueller and Neuman \cite{mueller2022scaling} in the continuous framework, highlighting both the distinct nature of the discrete model and its analytical tractability for studying polymer behavior in lattice-like environments.</description>

      <title>Growth rates for the H\"older coefficients of the linear stochastic fractional heat equation with rough dependence in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear stochastic fractional heat equation $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(t,x)=-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}u(t,x)+\dot{W}(t,x), \quad t&gt;0, \quad x\in\mathbb{R}, $$ where $-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ denotes the fractional Laplacian with power $\alpha\in (1,2)$, and the driving noise $\dot{W}$ is a centered Gaussian field that is white in time and has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in\left(\frac{2-\alpha}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)$. We establish exact asymptotics for the solution as $t, x \to \infty$ and derive sharp growth rates for the H\"older coefficients. The proofs are based on Talagrand's majorizing measure theorem and Sudakov's minoration theorem.</description>

      <title>Effect of stochasticity on the growth of the infty-parent SLFV process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of different forms of stochasticity on the expansion dynamics of a stochastic growth model called the $\infty$-parent spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming Viot process. This process belongs to a family of population genetics processes in a spatial continuum, and was recently introduced to study the evolution of genetic diversity in spatially expanding populations. Its stochastic reproduction dynamics gives rise to a rich growth structure, on which first theoretical results were obtained. In this paper, we further explore this growth dynamics using two complementary approaches: an analytical study of a simplified model for growth at the front edge, and a simulation-based study. We show that the observed expansion speed is the result of the interplay of stochasticity in shapes, timings and locations of reproduction events, each form of stochasticity being necessary but not sufficient to explain the expansion dynamics. We also identify distinctive scaling regimes for the variance of hitting times by the front and the bulk of the expansion. Moreover, we obtain results on the scaling of the front fluctuations, which point towards the front interface belonging to the KPZ universality class.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Theory of $\Theta$-Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent, non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation, is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm. This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Simulating Posterior Bayesian Neural Networks with Dependent Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an algorithm to sample from the network. In the shallow case we explicitly compute the distribution of the output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the theoretical results are numerically validated.</description>

      <title>Derivative Estimation from Coarse, Irregular, Noisy Samples: An MLE-Spline Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address numerical differentiation under coarse, non-uniform sampling and Gaussian noise. A maximum-likelihood estimator with $L_2$-norm constraint on a higher-order derivative is obtained, yielding spline-based solution. We introduce a non-standard parameterization of quadratic splines and develop recursive online algorithms. Two formulations -- quadratic and zero-order -- offer tradeoff between smoothness and computational speed. Simulations demonstrate superior performance over high-gain observers and super-twisting differentiators under coarse sampling and high noise, benefiting systems where higher sampling rates are impractical.</description>

      <title>Set Invariance with Probability One for Controlled Diffusion: Score-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods -- a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using several semi-analytical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Spectral measure for uniform $d$-regular digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the matrix $A_{\mathcal{G}}$ chosen uniformly at random from the finite set of all $N$-dimensional matrices of zero main-diagonal and binary entries, having each row and column of $A_{\mathcal{G}}$ sum to $d$. That is, the adjacency matrix for the uniformly random $d$-regular simple digraph $\mathcal{G}$. Fixing $d \ge 3$, it has long been conjectured that as $N \to \infty$ the corresponding empirical eigenvalue distributions converge weakly, in probability, to an explicit non-random limit, %measure $\mu_d$ on $\mathbb{C}$, which is given by the Brown measure of the free sum of $d$ Haar unitary operators. We reduce this conjecture to bounding the decay in $N$ of the probability that the minimal singular value of the shifted matrix $A(w) = A_{\mathcal{G}} - w I$ is very small. While the latter remains a challenging task, the required bound is comparable to the recently established control on the singularity of $A_{\mathcal{G}}$. The reduction is achieved here by sharp estimates on the behavior at large $N$, near the real line, of the Green's function (aka resolvent) of the Hermitization of $A(w)$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and Boolean independence described by a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ in the context of $\mathcal{T}$-free convolutions of Jekel and Liu. We prove general limit theorems for the associated additive convolution operations $\boxplus_G$. For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the Boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit, or digraphon. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorem for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>The Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for SPDEs in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a unified proof of the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem for various notions of solutions for SPDEs in Banach spaces with cylindrical Wiener noise. We use Kurtz' generalization of the theorems of Yamada, Watanabe and Engelbert. In addition, we deduce the classical Yamada-Watanabe theorem for SPDEs, with a slightly different notion of `unique strong solution' than that corresponding to the result of Kurtz. Our setting includes analytically strong solutions, analytically weak solutions and mild solutions. Moreover, our approach offers flexibility with regard to the function spaces and integrability conditions that are chosen in the solution notion (and affect the meaning of existence and uniqueness). All results hold in Banach spaces which are either martingale type 2 or UMD. For analytically weak solutions, the results hold in arbitrary Banach spaces. In particular, our results extend the Yamada-Watanabe theorems of Ondrej\'at for mild solutions in 2-smooth Banach spaces, of R\"ockner et al. for the variational framework and of Kunze for analytically weak solutions, and cover many new settings. As a tool, and of interest itself, we construct a measurable representation $I$ of the stochastic integral in a martingale type 2 or UMD Banach space, in the sense that for any stochastically integrable process $f$ and cylindrical Brownian motion $W$, we have $I(f(\omega),W(\omega),\mathrm{Law}(f,W)) = (\int_0^{\cdot} f\, \mathrm{d}W)(\omega)$ for almost every $\omega$.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Random Geometric Graphs in High and Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a multivariate central limit theorem (CLT) to study the distribution of random geometric graphs (RGGs) on the cube and torus in the high-dimensional limit with general node distributions. We find that the distribution of RGGs on the torus converges to the Erd\H os-R\'enyi (ER) ensemble when the nodes are uniformly distributed, but that the distribution for RGGs with non-uniformly distributed nodes on the torus, and for RGGs with any distribution of nodes with kurtosis greater than 1 on the cube is different. In these cases, the distribution has a lower maximum entropy than the ER ensemble, but is still symmetric. Soft RGGs in either geometry converge to the ER ensemble. An Edgeworth correction to the CLT is then developed to derive the $\mathcal{O}\left(d^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ sub-leading term of the Shannon entropy of RGGs in dimension for both geometries. We also provide numerical approximations of maximum entropy in low-dimensional hard and soft RGGs, and calculate exactly the entropy of hard RGGs with 3 nodes in the one-dimensional cube and torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of a class of boundary random walks to Brownian-type processes on the half-line. By solving the associated martingale problem and employing weak convergence techniques, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the process converges to the general Brownian motion in the $J_1$-Skorokhod topology. The limiting process exhibits both diffusion and boundary behavior characterized by parameters $(\alpha, \beta, A, B)$, which govern the transition rates at the origin. Our results provide a discrete approximation to generalized Brownian motions with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the Bass Local Volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bass local volatility model introduced by Backhoff-Veraguas, Beiglb\"ock, Huesmann, and K\"allblad is a Markov model perfectly calibrated to vanilla options at finitely many maturities, that approximates the Dupire local volatility model. Conze and Henry-Labord\`ere show that its calibration can be achieved by solving a fixed-point equation. In this paper we complement the analysis and show existence and uniqueness of the solution to this equation, and that the fixed-point iteration scheme converges at a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Upgraded free independence phenomena for random unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upgraded free independence phenomena for unitary elements $u_1$, $u_2$, \dots representing the large-$n$ limit of Haar random unitaries, showing that free independence extends to several larger algebras containing $u_j$ in the ultraproduct of matrices $\prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Using a uniform asymptotic freeness argument and volumetric analysis, we prove free independence of the Pinsker algebras $\mathcal{P}_j$ containing $u_j$. The Pinsker algebra $\mathcal{P}_j$ is the maximal subalgebra containing $u_j$ with vanishing $1$-bounded entropy defined by Hayes; $\mathcal{P}_j$ in particular contains the relative commutant $\{u_j\}' \cap \prod_{n \to \mathcal{U}} M_n(\mathbb{C})$, more generally any unitary that can be connected to $u_j$ by a sequence of commuting pairs of Haar unitaries, and any unitary $v$ such that $v\mathcal{P}_j v^* \cap \mathcal{P}_j$ is diffuse. Through an embedding argument, we go back and deduce analogous free independence results for $\mathcal{M}^{\mathcal{U}}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a free product of Connes embeddable tracial von Neumann algebras $\mathcal{M}_i$, which thus yields (in the Connes-embeddable case) a generalization and a new proof of Houdayer--Ioana's results on free independence of approximate commutants. It also yields a new proof of the general absorption results for Connes-embeddable free products obtained by the first author, Hayes, Nelson, and Sinclair.</description>

      <title>Small deviations of Gaussian multiplicative chaos and the free energy of the two-dimensional massless Sinh--Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a global decomposition result for $\log$-correlated Gaussian fields on the $d$-dimensional torus and use this to derive new small deviations bounds for a class of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures obtained from Gaussian fields with zero spatial mean on the $d$-dimensional torus. The upper bound is obtained by a modification of the method that was used in \cite{LRV}, and the lower bound is obtained by applying the Donsker--Varadhan variational formula.
  We also give the probabilistic path integral formulation of the massless Sinh--Gordon model on a torus of side length $R$, and study its partition function as $R$ tends to infinity. We apply the small deviation bounds for Gaussian multiplicative chaos to obtain lower and upper bounds for the logarithm of the partition function, leading to the existence of a non-zero and finite subsequential infinite volume limit for the free energy.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of an Ising-type model, and exact solvability of the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem, Auto-Correlation and Sequences with an Empty Fourier-Bohr Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation. As for pointwise convergence, this was already observed in [5], and here we exploit the opportunity to write down the proof. This yields a more intrinsic characterization of the sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem. Then we proceed and obtain a characterization linked to auto-correlation also to sequences satisfying the mean theorem - by that theorem those were already known to be exactly the sequences with an empty Fourier-Bohr spectrum. Some further investigation is done and examples are provided regarding generic sequences for which the measure on the circle that the auto-correlation function represents (by Fourier transform) is not atomless.</description>

      <title>Structure of average distance minimizers in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed, compactly supported probability measure $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we consider the problem of minimizing the $p^{\mathrm{th}}$-power average distance functional over all compact, connected $\Sigma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with Hausdorff 1-measure $\mathcal{H}^1(\Sigma) \leq l$. This problem, known as the average distance problem, was first studied by Buttazzo, Oudet, and Stepanov in 2002, and has undergone a considerable amount of research since. We will provide a novel approach to studying this problem by analyzing it using the so-called \textit{barycentre field} considered previously by Hayase and two of the authors. This allows us to provide a complete topological description of minimizers in arbitrary dimensions when $p = 2$ and $p &gt; \frac{1}{2}(3 + \sqrt{5}) \approx 2.618$, the first such result that includes the case when $d &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities and universal approximators for random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities are indispensable tools in the study of dimension reduction and low-distortion embeddings of graphs into metric spaces, and have found remarkable algorithmic applications. A basic open problem, posed by Jon Kleinberg (2013), asks whether the optimal nonlinear Poincar\'e constant for maps between two independent $3$-regular random graphs is dimension-free, i.e., independent of vertex-set sizes. We give a complete and affirmative resolution to Kleinberg's problem, also allowing for arbitrary graph degrees. As a corollary, we obtain a stochastic construction of $O(1)\text{-universal}$ approximators for random graphs, answering a question of Mendel and Naor.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \] where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi}, $ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1), $ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate almost surely.</description>
