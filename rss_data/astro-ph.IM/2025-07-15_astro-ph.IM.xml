      <title>Bridging Literature and the Universe Via A Multi-Agent Large Language Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Roman Coronagraph Instrument Star Acquisition in Thermal Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is a flagship astrophysics mission planned for launch no later than May 2027. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) aboard Roman will demonstrate the technology for direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets around nearby stars and starlight suppression that surpass previous space-based and ground-based coronagraphs. This is accomplished using active wavefront control in space with deformable mirrors. CGI requires a star acquisition system capable of acquiring reference and target stars to achieve this goal. This paper describes two CGI star acquisition system methods: EXCAM and Raster Scan. Furthermore, it will detail the results of the CGI thermal vacuum (TVAC) tests conducted to evaluate system-level star acquisition and verify its performance requirements.</description>

      <title>Mars Clocks and other novel analog clocks, using Earth Standard Seconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analog clocks fitted to the Mars solar day. These clocks use the standard Earth-based second of the International System of Units (SI) as their operational unit of time, unlike current practice for Mars timekeeping. We discuss the importance of preserving the SI second. On this basis, we identify the two analog clocks most suitable for public use by a future Mars population. These are a 20-hour clock with a hand motion similar to that of the standard Earth clock, and a 24-hour clock with a novel "Martian" hand motion which strikes the hour when all 3 hands converge onto that hour mark on the dial. Both clocks have Earth-day equivalents to assist learning. We also present a 24-hour "SpaceClock", similar to the Martian clock but with no favored reference plane, hence equally readable from any viewing orientation.</description>

      <title>Calibration and Performance of the Surface Scintillator Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has led to significant advances in our understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These new insights have driven a major upgrade of the Observatory, known as AugerPrime, through which the experiment has entered its Phase II, a new period of data collection. A key part of the upgrade is adding surface scintillator detectors (SSD) on top of the existing water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD). The main goal is to leverage their different responses to the electromagnetic and muonic shower components, enhancing the reconstruction of the primary cosmic-ray mass. In this contribution, we present the methods that involve analyzing peak and charge distributions of atmospheric muons for accurate calibration during extensive air-shower event reconstruction, along with the development of a rate-based algorithm for independent calibration. We also show the performance of the SSDs with Phase-II data, including PMT reliability and stability of key parameters, such as gain and signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Photon Searches with the Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this contribution, we present a novel method for photon-hadron discrimination in the energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms. Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level. Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Unexplored Opportunities for Automatic Differentiation in Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD) applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP (Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems &amp; Phenomena), a unified framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their implementation.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of antennas to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by them.</description>

      <title>The Great Observatories: A Triumph of the Human Spirit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In January of 1985, more than 40 years ago, a group of astronomers met with NASA officials to map out the future of NASA space astronomy. Their efforts led to the Great Observatories program, linking four powerful space telescopes to study the heavens in four regions of the spectrum. The successful launch and operation of the Spitzer Space Telescope in the Fall of 2003 completed the launch of the Great Observatories, almost 20 years after the program was formulated, and two of the Observatories, Hubble and Chandra, continue to operate very productively. The scientific and public education results of the Great Observatories are well-known. Here we emphasize that fulfilling the extraordinary vision of the Great Observatories was a triumph of human ingenuity, dedication, and determination.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Stellar Mass Predictions from Broad-Band Magnitudes with a Simple Neural Network: Application to Simulated Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths - generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables, enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Shared-optical-path VLBI frequency phase transfer from 86 to 258 GHz on an 8600 km baseline: Demonstrated with the APEX and IRAM 30 m telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The receiver N3AR operating at a frequency range between 67 and 116 GHz has been commissioned at the APEX telescope in October 2024. This adds a new low-frequency band for APEX, with the capability of simultaneous dual-frequency observations using a dichroic beamsplitter. The 3 mm receiver also allows APEX to join the existing 3 mm global VLBI network. One of our commissioning goals was to perform simultaneous dual-band VLBI observations at 86 and 258 GHz using receivers with shared-optical-paths (SOP) to correct the atmospheric phase fluctuations using the frequency phase transfer (FPT) technique. This was possible together with the IRAM 30 m telescope, which has already developed such a capability. We aimed to verify the expected phase coherence and sensitivity improvement at the higher frequency achievable by applying FPT. With the dual-band, single baseline data, we applied the FPT method, which uses the lower frequency data to correct the simultaneously observed higher-frequency data. We evaluate the improvement compared to the conventional single-band observing mode by analyzing the coherence factor in the higher frequency data. Our results show that the phase fluctuations at the two bands are well correlated. After applying FPT, the interferometric phases at the higher frequency vary much slower and the coherence factor is significantly improved. Our analysis confirms the feasibility of applying FPT to frequencies above 250 GHz with SOP receivers. Future observations in this mode could dramatically improve the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of high-frequency VLBI.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: Empowering Citizen Scientists in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of real-time astronomy, citizen scientists play an increasingly important role in the discovery and follow-up of transient astrophysical phenomena. From local astronomical societies to global initiatives, amateur astronomers contribute valuable observational data that complement professional efforts. Astro-COLIBRI facilitates these contributions by providing a user-friendly platform that integrates real-time alerts, data visualization tools, and collaborative features to support astronomers at all levels.
  The Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program provides engagement opportunities across multiple scales. At the grassroots level, we collaborate with local astronomy clubs, equipping them with accessible tools for transient event monitoring. National and international networks, such as RAPAS in France, leverage Astro-COLIBRI's real-time capabilities for coordinated observations. On a global scale, we actively participate in high-impact citizen science and capacity building initiatives, including the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Citizen Science Program and the "Open Universe" initiative led by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). These collaborations enhance the accessibility of real-time astrophysical data and foster inclusive participation in cutting-edge astronomy.
  In this contribution, we will present the Astro-COLIBRI Citizen Science Program, highlighting its technical framework, community impact, and case studies of successful amateur contributions. We will showcase how our platform facilitates the rapid exchange of information between professional and amateur astronomers, democratizing access to multi-messenger astrophysics and enabling the global community to contribute meaningfully to time-domain discoveries.</description>

      <title>Digitization of Astronomical Photographic Plate of China: Photometric Calibration of Single-exposure Plates and Release of Photometric Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Plate-Digitizing Project has digitized a total number of about 30,000 astronomical plates from 11 telescopes of five observatories (SHAO, NAOC, PMO, YNAO, and QDO) in China, spanning nearly 100 years of observations. In this work, we present a photometric calibration method to calibrate about 15,000 single-exposure plates to the JKC photometric system. Using standard stars constructed from the BEST database, we have identified and corrected various systematic effects (including the magnitude term, color term, and flat-field term) to a high precision. The final photometric precision is typically 0.15, 0.23, 0.17, 0.11, 0.19 mag for plates collected in SHAO, NAOC, PMO, YNAO, and QDO, respectively, with best cases reaching 0.07, 0.08, 0.06, 0.05, and 0.11 mag, respectively. Candidates of variable sources are also identified. The catalogs are publicly available at the China National Astronomical Data Center. Such a dataset will provide a valuable resource for conducting long-term, temporal-scale astronomical research. Our calibration method can also be applied to other digitized astronomical plates in general.</description>

      <title>A NuSTAR study of quasi-periodic oscillations from the ultraluminous X-ray sources in M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries provides valuable insights into the physics of accretion around compact objects. The M82 galaxy hosts two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), one of which is suspected to harbor an intermediate-mass black hole. Using 39 NuSTAR observations acquired between 2014--2024, we investigate the aperiodic X-ray variability in M82. In particular, we study in detail the evolution of the QPO from M82 X-1 in the range 20--300 mHz. We do not find additional timing features in the data, besides a frequent broad noise component at lower frequencies. The QPO behaves similarly to other classes of low-frequency oscillations in accreting compact objects, both black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers using radio antennas has evolved into a mature technique, complementing particle detector arrays by providing sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers and enabling an independent determination of the cosmic-ray energy. Both the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole have been undergoing upgrades, including the integration of radio antennas. The next-generation neutrino detector IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface array for PeV-EeV cosmic-ray detection, consisting of scintillation detectors and radio antennas. Prototype stations for this upgrade have been in operation for several years at both, the South Pole and the Auger Observatory, enabling cross-checks and potentially a cross-calibration of the energy scales between the two experiments. In this contribution, we present an analysis of air showers observed with the radio antennas of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station, coinciding with detections by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the densest part of the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface array, featuring a 433 m spacing.</description>

      <title>Muon Signal Charge in the Underground Muon Detector of AugerPrime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.</description>

      <title>MVPinn: Integrating Milne-Eddington Inversion with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for GST/NIRIS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MVPinn, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach tailored for solving the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion problem, specifically applied to spectropolarimetric observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory's Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (BBSO/NIRIS) at the Fe I 1.56 {\mu}m lines. Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments, with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption. Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.</description>

      <title>Millions of Main-Sequence Binary Stars from Gaia BP/RP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. II. The correlation between SFE and L/M indicator for the evolutionary stages of star-forming clumps in post-processed RMHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them, the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope, $L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our suite of simulations.
  Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Search for Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory: New Triggers, Methods, and Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector (SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE) range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle range of $60^{\circ} &lt; \theta &lt; 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$ search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be presented for the angular range explored.</description>

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger. Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons, and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations for Auger data analysis.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption, respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band. Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10304v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it. We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.</description>

      <title>Improving Gamma-ray Source Search with Image Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of HAWC data is done using a likeihood-based systematic multi-source search procedure utilizing the threeML software package and the HAL Plugin. This approach was inspired by the extended source search described in the Fermi-LAT Extended Source Search Catalog. The pipeline to search for point sources and extended sources within the region of interest (ROI) is described in the recent HAWC papers. This procedure is computationally intensive and often requires multiple days to produce a final model for a region. Often this approach misses fainter sources, which need to be added manually later. This blind search could be complemented by providing a method to seed source locations, which can be assessed and evaluated by likelihood analysis, thereby significantly reducing the computational time and resources spent on finding a model.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Methods for Very Large Astrometric Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for inferring smooth models of the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes. This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M &lt;&lt; N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data. Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z&gt;15$), using four nights of observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of 26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At $z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;4.6 \times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at $z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}&lt;5.0 \times 10^6 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic 21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the Galactic centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of cosmic-ray properties with GNN in GRAND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect and study ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos by observing the radio emissions produced in extensive air showers. The GRANDProto300 prototype primarily focuses on UHE cosmic rays to demonstrate the autonomous detection and reconstruction techniques that will later be applied to neutrino detection. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the arrival direction and energy with high precision using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques from noisy simulated voltage traces. For each event, we represent the triggered antennas as a graph structure, which is used as input for a graph neural network (GNN). To significantly enhance precision and reduce the required training set size, we incorporate physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data. This approach achieves an angular resolution of 0.14{\deg} and a primary energy reconstruction resolution of about 15%. Additionally, we employ uncertainty estimation methods to improve the reliability of our predictions. These methods allow us to quantify the confidence of the GNN predictions and provide confidence intervals for the direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we explore strategies to evaluate the consistency and robustness of the model when applied to real data. Our goal is to identify situations where predictions remain trustworthy despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</description>

      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating LISA inference with Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable, End-to-End Forward Model for 21 cm Cosmology: Estimating the Foreground, Instrument, and Signal Joint Posterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a differentiable, end-to-end Bayesian forward modeling framework for line intensity mapping cosmology experiments, with a specific focus on low-frequency radio telescopes targeting the redshifted 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen as a cosmological probe. Our framework is capable of posterior density estimation of the cosmological signal jointly with foreground and telescope parameters at the field level. Our key aim is to be able to optimize the model's high-dimensional, non-linear, and ill-conditioned parameter space, while also sampling from it to perform robust uncertainty quantification within a Bayesian framework. We show how a differentiable programming paradigm, accelerated by recent advances in machine learning software and hardware, can make this computationally-demanding, end-to-end Bayesian approach feasible. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept on a signal recovery problem for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array experiment, highlighting the framework's ability to build confidence in early 21 cm signal detections even in the presence of poorly understood foregrounds and instrumental systematics. We use a Hessian-preconditioned Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample our parameter space with a dimensionality approaching $N\sim10^5$, which enables joint, end-to-end nuisance parameter marginalization over foreground and instrumental terms. Lastly, we introduce a new spherical harmonic formalism that is a complete and orthogonal basis on the cut sky relevant to drift-scan radio surveys, which we call the spherical stripe harmonic formalism, and it's associated three-dimensional basis, the spherical stripe Fourier-Bessel formalism.</description>

      <title>Validating the bright Gaia celestial reference frame with new VLBI astrometry of radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist inconsistencies between the bright and faint Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 3 (Gaia-CRF3), which manifests as a systematic rotation and needs to be independently estimated then corrected in future data releases. We collected 64 radio stars with VLBI astrometry, of which 16 have new VLBI observations with reference epochs close to Gaia. We estimated the orientation and spin biases of the bright Gaia-CRF3 by comparing VLBI radio star astrometry with their Gaia DR3 counterparts. We also attempted to estimate orientation by utilizing the a priori magnitude-dependent spin parameters derived from Gaia internal estimation. Our independent estimation of the orientation at G&lt;10.5 is [-15\pm119, +330\pm139,+218\pm109] uas (J2016.0), and the spin ([+21\pm18, +52\pm20,-7\pm20] uas/yr) agrees with Gaia internal estimation within 1-sigma range. The orientation-only estimation suggests that the orientation bias of the bright Gaia-CRF3 may also be magnitude-dependent.</description>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. \textbf{We obtained B,V, R, I, g, r, i, and z photometry with the Kottamia Astronomical Observatory 1.88-m telescope, the Palomar 200-inch telescope, and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5-m telescope on 2024 July 2, 3, and 6. We measured colour indices B-V=0.98$\pm$0.23, V-R=0.71$\pm$0.09, R-I=0.14$\pm$0.10, g-r=0.84$\pm$0.05 mag, r-i=0.16$\pm$0.03 mag, i-z=-0.02$\pm$0.07 mag, and g-i=1.00$\pm$0.05 mag and a spectral slope of 16.0$\pm$1.9 $\%$/100 nm.} We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 184.6$\pm$4.6 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. 3I/ATLAS's coma has FWHM$\simeq$2.2 arcsec and A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$=280.8$\pm$3.2 cm. \textbf{We estimate that 3I/ATLAS's \textmu m-scale to mm-scale dust is ejected at $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying a dust production of $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>
