      <title>LTDE: The Lens Time Delay Experiment I. From pixels to light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars offer a unique opportunity to study cosmological and extragalactic phenomena, using reliable light curves of the lensed images. This requires accurate deblending of the quasar images, which is not trivial due to the small separation between the lensed images (typically $\sim1$ arcsec) and because there is light contamination by the lensing galaxy and the quasar host galaxy. We propose a series of experiments aimed at testing our ability to extract precise and accurate photometry of lensed quasars. In this first paper, we focus on evaluating our ability to extract light curves from simulated CCD images of lensed quasars spanning a broad range of configurations and assuming different observational/instrumental conditions. Specifically, the experiment proposes to go from pixels to light curves and to evaluate the limits of current photometric algorithms. Our experiment has several steps, from data with known point spread function (PSF), to an unknown spatially-variable PSF field that the user has to take into account. This paper is the release of our simulated images. Anyone can extract the light curves and submit their results by the deadline. These will be evaluated with the metrics described below. Our set of simulations will be public and it is meant to be a benchmark for time-domain surveys like Rubin-LSST or other follow-up time-domain observations at higher temporal cadence. It is also meant to be a test set to help develop new algorithms in the future.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective optimization for scattering mitigation and scattering screen reconstruction in VLBI observations of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging reconstruction of interferometric data is a hard ill-posed inverse problem. Its difficulty is increased when observing the Galactic Center, which is obscured by a scattering screen. This is because the scattering breaks the one-to-one correspondence between images and visibilities. Solving the scattering problem is one of the biggest challenges in radio imaging of the Galactic Center. In this work we present a novel strategy to mitigate its effect and constrain the screen itself using multiobjective optimization. We exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to describe the optimization landscape to recover the intrinsic source structure and the scattering screen affecting the data. We successfully recover both the screen and the source in a wide range of simulated cases, including the speed of a moving screen at 230 GHz. Particularly, we can recover a ring structure in scattered data at 86 GHz. Our analysis demonstrates the huge potential that recent advancements in imaging and optimization algorithms offer to recover image structures, even in weakly constrained and degenerated, possibly multi-modal settings. The successful reconstruction of the scattering screen opens the window to event horizon scale works on the Galactic Center at 86G Hz up to 116 GHz, and the study of the scattering screen itself.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Temperature Dependence of the Refractive Index of CdZnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been developing a CdZnTe immersion grating for a compact high-dispersion mid-infrared spectrometer (wavelength range 10--18 $\mu$m, spectral resolution $R = \lambda/\Delta \lambda &gt; 25,000$, operating temperature $T &lt; 20$ K). Using an immersion grating, the spectrometer size can be reduced to $1/n$ ($n$: refractive index) compared to conventional diffraction gratings. CdZnTe is promising as a material for immersion gratings for the wavelength range. However, the refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe has not been measured at $T &lt; 20$ K.
  We have been developing a system to precisely measure $n$ at cryogenic temperatures ($T \sim 10$ K) in the mid-infrared wavelength range. As the first result, this paper reports the temperature dependence of $n$ of CdZnTe at the wavelength of 10.68 $\mu$m. This system employs the minimum deviation method. The refractive index $n$ of CdZnTe is measured at temperatures of \( T = 12.57, 22.47, 50.59, 70.57, \text{ and } 298 \, \text{K} \). We find that $n$ of CdZnTe at $\lambda =$ 10.68 $\mu$m is $2.6371 \pm 0.0022$ at $12.57 \pm 0.14$ K, and the average temperature dependence of $n$ between 12.57 $\pm$ 0.14 K and 70.57 $\pm$ 0.23 K is $\Delta n/\Delta T = (5.8 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Radiometer Calibration using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiometers are crucial instruments in radio astronomy, forming the primary component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A radiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), which is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However, impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.</description>

      <title>Stellar ejection velocities from the binary supernova scenario: A comparison across population synthesis codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of binary systems are disrupted at the moment of the first supernova, resulting in an unbound compact object and companion star. These ejected companion stars contribute to the observed population of runaway stars. Therefore, an understanding of their ejection velocities is essential to interpreting observations, particularly in the Gaia era of high-precision astronomy.
  We present a comparison of the predicted ejection velocities of disrupted binary companions in three different population synthesis codes: COSMIC, COMPAS, and binary_c, which use two independent algorithms for the treatment of natal kicks. We confirm that, despite the codes producing different pre-supernova evolution from the same initial conditions, they each find the ejection velocities of secondary stars from disrupted binaries are narrowly distributed about their pre-supernova orbital velocity. We additionally include a correction to the derivation included in Kiel &amp; Hurley 2009 that brings it into agreement with methods from other works for determining post-supernova binary orbital parameters. During this comparison, we identified and resolved bugs in the kick prescriptions of \textit{all three} codes we considered, highlighting how open-science practices and code comparisons are essential for addressing implementation issues.</description>

      <title>Photonic single-arm gravitational wave detectors based on the quantum state transition of orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the quantum state transition of photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the present of gravitational waves (GWs) and demonstrate the potential of a new photonic single-arm GW detection technique. The interaction is calculated based on the framework of the wave propagation in linearized gravity theory and canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field in curved spacetime. It is demonstrated that when a photon possessing OAM of 1 interacts with GWs, it may relinquish its OAM and produce a central signal that may be detected. The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in the low-frequency range ($&lt;1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in the mid-frequency range ($1\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary GW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the high-frequency range ($&gt;10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector parameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is insensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is proportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for determining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer detectors. This technique not only facilitates the extraction of GW information but also creates a new approach for identifying and selecting GW signals.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <title>StarWhisper Telescope: Agent-Based Observation Assistant System to Approach AI Astrophysicist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.</description>
