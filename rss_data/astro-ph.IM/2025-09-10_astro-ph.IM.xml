      <title>What is the maximum radius of cold planets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets have maximum radii close to that of Jupiter. Qualitatively, the reason for this maximum size is that, as one adds mass, the force of gravity becomes sufficiently strong to cause the radius to decrease. We show that this effect can be understood quantitatively using a simple variational principle very similar to that used to compute the size of the hydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Opto-Mechanical design of SHARP: a near-infrared multi-mode spectrograph conceived for the next-generation telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), with their wide apertures and advanced Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, will provide unprecedented sharp and deep observations, even surpassing the capabilities of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). SHARP, a near-infrared (0.95-2.45 {\mu}m) spectrograph, is designed to optimally exploit the collecting area and angular resolution of these forthcoming ELTs, and specifically optimized for the MCAO unit MORFEO at the ELT. SHARP includes two main units: NEXUS, a Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS), and VESPER, a multi-Integral Field Unit. This paper outlines the opto-mechanical design of SHARP based on the scientific requirements of the project. The optical design is engineered to meet project specifications, featuring a compact mechanical structure that minimizes the required cryogenic power while ensuring ease of access for maintenance and straightforward assembly procedures.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Gravitational-wave Background Across the Spectrum with a Next-Generation Anisotropic Per-frequency Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) having observed a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies, the focus of the field is shifting towards determining and characterizing its origin. While the primary candidate is a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many other cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral properties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an SMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB sourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a cosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially large-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use the frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair correlations and relatively low computational overhead compared to spatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations with the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by incorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between pulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal statistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing null-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By combining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to specific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while impacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a $p$-value of $\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency search. Our methods are already incorporated in community-available code and ready to deploy on forthcoming PTA datasets.</description>

      <title>An on-sky investigation into factors limiting the performance of Keck-NIRC2 for conducting infrared high-contrast imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common instrument used by the exoplanet/brown dwarf direct imaging community at the W.M. Keck Observatory is currently the NIRC2 near-infrared imager. We performed on-sky testing to investigate three effects which may be limiting the performance of NIRC2 when conducting high-contrast imaging observations from $3-5\mu$m. First, we report the measurements of an on-sky test of the throughput of the L/M vector vortex coronagraph. We quantify the throughput and additional background flux penalties, noting that the performance effects of using the vector vortex coronagraph in the Ms-filter are greater than in the Lp-filter. Second, we utilize the recently commissioned NIRC2 electronics upgrade to measure the sky variability at sub-second speeds. We find that the background varies at timescales of less than 30s, indicating that the electronics upgrade may open an opportunity to improve the sky-background subtraction of future surveys. Third, we document the contribution of the image derotator to the spatial non-uniformity in the background flux. We conclude by giving a set of recommendations of how the Keck-NIRC2 high-contrast imaging community can adapt their observing strategies to improve the sensitivity of future surveys.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning empowered search for Sub-Minute Optical Transient Events with the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical transient surveys continue to generate increasingly large datasets, prompting the introduction of machine-learning algorithms to search for quality transient candidates efficiently. Existing machine-learning infrastructure can be leveraged in novel ways to search these datasets for new classes of transients. We present a machine-learning accelerated search pipeline for the Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme designed to identify high-quality astrophysical transient candidates that contain a single detection. Given the rapid observing cadence of the DWF programme, these single-detection transient candidates have durations on sub-minute timescales. This work marks the first time optical transients have been systematically explored on these timescales, to a depth of m$\sim$23. We report the discovery of two high-quality sub-minute transient candidates from a pilot study of 671,761 light curves and investigate their potential origins with multiwavelength data. We discuss, in detail, possible non-astrophysical false positives, confidently reject electronic artefacts and asteroids, ruling out glints from satellites below 800 km and strongly disfavouring those at higher altitudes. We calculate a rate on the sky of $4.72^{+6.39}_{-3.28}\times10^5$ per day for these sub-minute transient candidates.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Jipole}$: A Differentiable $\texttt{ipole}$-based Code for Radiative Transfer in Curved Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>Toward the fabric of the Milky Way I. The density of disk streams from a local $250^3$ pc$^3$ volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07075v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied 12 disk streams found in a 250$^3$ pc$^3$ volume in the solar neighborhood, which we define as coeval and comoving stellar structures with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Using Gaia Data Release 3 data and the advanced clustering algorithms SigMA and Uncover, we identified and characterized these streams beyond the search volume, doubling, on average, their known populations. We estimate the number density of disk streams to be $\approx 820$ objects / kpc$^3$ (for $|Z| &lt; 100$ pc), or surface densities of $\approx 160$ objects / kpc$^2$. These estimates surpass N-body estimates by one to two orders of magnitude and challenge the prevailing understanding of their destruction mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that these 12 disk streams are dynamically cold with 3D velocity dispersions between 2 and 5 km s$^{-1}$, exhibit narrow sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and are highly elongated with average aspect ratios of 7:1, extending up to several hundred parsecs. We find evidence suggesting that one of the disk streams, currently embedded in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, is experiencing disruption, likely due to the primordial gas mass of the association.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Exorings in Reflected Light with JWST NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When directly imaging a cold giant exoplanet hosting a ring system, the reflected light from the rings can outshine the planet's thermal emission and reflected-light in the near-infrared. Consequently, an exoring may be detectable at a significantly lower contrasts than is required to image the exoplanet itself. Here we investigate the detectability of exorings in near-infrared reflected light using NIRCam coronagraphy PanCAKE simulations of two nearby mature stars, Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti. Under the most favorable assumptions, we find JWST 2$\mu$m NIRCam coronagraphy (F200W + MASK335R) is capable of detecting an exoring system with a radius of 2.8 times that of Saturn's A-ring for planets on an orbit with a = 1.3-1.9 AU. Broader simulations indicate that NIRCam can probe large planetary ring systems around mature exoplanets comparable in size to circumplanetary disks, which can reach up to 1000 times the radius of Saturn's A-ring. These results suggest that NIRCam F200W coronagraphy could serendipitously detect large exorings in reflected light under the right conditions. A combined analysis of F200W coronagraphic observations of confirmed exoplanets could provide the first empirical constraints on the occurrence rate of large exorings. Confirming the existence and frequency of exorings spanning the scale between circumplanetary disks and the rings of the Solar System giant planet could offer new insight into the formation, evolution, and architecture of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH): a spectrometer for the GRIPS-2 balloon campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon. IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.
  The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.</description>

      <title>CLEAN and multi-scale CLEAN for STIX in Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLEAN is a well-established deconvolution approach to Fourier imaging at both radio wavelwengths and hard X-ray energies. However, specifically for hard X-ray imaging, CLEAN suffers two significant drawbacks: a rather limited degree of automation, and a tendency to under-resolution. This paper introduces a multi-scale version of CLEAN specifically tailored to the reconstruction of images from measurements observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar Orbiter. Using synthetic STIX data, this study shows that multi-scale CLEAN may represent a reliable solution to the two previously mentioned CLEAN limitations. Further, this paper shows the performances of CLEAN and its multi-scale release in reconstructing experimental real scenarios characterized by complex emission morphologies.</description>

      <title>When (not) to trust Monte Carlo approximations for hierarchical Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coming years of gravitational wave astrophysics promises thousands of new detections, which can unlock fundamental scientific insights if the information in each observation can be properly synthesized into a coherent picture. State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\hat{E} \lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \texttt{pip}-installable package \texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\hat{E}$.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based generative model for planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of planetary system formation are very demanding in terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return, be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model, trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used, for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally, as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.</description>

In this study, we simulate the ability of space-based coronagraphy missions to uncover trends in planetary albedo as a function of instellation, and potentially constrain the boundaries of the habitable zone. We adapt the Bioverse statistical comparative planetology framework to simulate the scientific output of possible designs for HWO. With this tool, we generate a synthetic planetary population with injected population-level trends in albedo and simulate the observability of planets. We then determine the statistical power to which these trends can be recovered as a function of the strength of the injected trend and the sample size of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone (exoEarths). The strongest trends in albedo require a sample size of roughly 25-30 exoEarths to recover with high confidence. However, for weaker albedo trends, the required number of planets increases rapidly. If a mission is designed to meet the Decadal Survey's requirement of 25 exoEarths, it would be able to recover very strong trends in albedo associated with the habitable zone, but would struggle to confidently detect weaker trends. We explore multiple strategies to increase one's ability to recover weak trends, such as reducing the uncertainties in observables, incorporating additional observables such as planet colors, and obtaining direct constraints on planetary albedo from full spectral retrievals.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Mode Propulsion Mission Design Using Direct Collocation</title>

Abstract: The problem of minimizing the transfer time between periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon elliptic restricted three-body problem using a multi-mode propulsion system is considered. By employing the true anomaly on the primary orbit as the independent variable and introducing normalized time as an additional state, the need to repeatedly solve Kepler's equation at arbitrary epochs is eliminated. Furthermore, a propellant constraint is imposed on the high-thrust mode to activate the multi-mode capabilities of the system and balance efficiency with maneuverability. The minimum-time optimal control problem is formulated as a three-phase trajectory consisting of a coast along the initial periodic orbit, a controlled transfer, and a coast along the terminal periodic orbit. The three-phase optimal control problem is then solved using an adaptive Gaussian quadrature direct collocation method. Case studies are presented for transfers from an L2 southern halo orbit to a near-rectilinear halo orbit, analyzing the impact of different single- and multi-mode propulsion architectures and varying propellant constraint values. Finally, the methodology developed in this paper provides a systematic framework for generating periodic orbit transfers in three-body systems using single- and multi-mode propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Reassessment of Kepler's habitable zone Earth-like exoplanets with data-driven null-signal templates</title>

Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation, and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting Null Signal Template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius $1.5 R{\oplus}$, a period of 384 days, and KOI 2194.03 with radius $1.8 R{\oplus}$ and a period of 445 days, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.</description>

      <title>Simulating RISTRETTO: Proxima b detectability in reflected light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of exoplanet atmospheres is one of the key topics in modern astrophysics. To date, transmission spectroscopy has been the primary method used, but upcoming instruments will lay the foundation for advancing reflected-light spectroscopy. The main challenge in this area of research is the high contrast ratio between the planet and its star. RISTRETTO, a high-resolution integral-field spectrograph designed for ESO's VLT, aims to address these limitations through a combination of extreme AO, coronagraphy, and high-resolution spectroscopy. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the detectability of the temperate rocky planet Proxima b with RISTRETTO, using realistic end-to-end simulations and a specifically developed data analysis methodology. We created high-resolution star and planet spectra, selecting realistic observational epochs and incorporating the predicted performance of the AO and coronagraphic systems. We implemented noise and spectrograph effects through the Pyechelle spectrograph simulator. We then applied a new methodology to isolate the signal of the planet from the stellar one and proceeded to fit several planetary models in order of increasing complexity. We also introduced a method to determine the sky orientation of the stellar spin axis, which constrains the orientation of the planetary orbit for aligned systems. Assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, our results show that RISTRETTO can detect Proxima b in reflected light in about 55 hours of observing time, offering the ability to characterize the planet orbital inclination, true mass, and broadband albedo. In addition, molecular absorption by O$_2$ and H$_2$O can be detected in about 85 hours of observations. These findings highlight the potential of RISTRETTO to significantly advance the field of exoplanetary science by enabling reflected-light spectroscopy of a sample of nearby exoplanets.</description>

      <title>A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes: X -- Comparing stochastic YSO light curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light curves of young stars exhibit photometric variability over hours to decades and across a wide range of amplitudes. On time scales beyond a few rotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability arises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction variations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a methodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these inhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this, we converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the probability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying principal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable distribution of the first two principal components. We show that this distribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated fingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the distribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and observed light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric uncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model placement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance among highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset of significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the most critical. The secondary cause of variance are long-term (above 1.5yr) dimming or rising trends.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the significantly improved sensitivity and a wider frequency band, the next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are anticipated to detect $\sim 10^5$ GW signals per year with durations from hours to days, leading to inevitable signal overlaps in the data stream. While a direct fitting for all signals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap with other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise from the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial for developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of biases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus on the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination angles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity, named the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between the biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit dependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example, we further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the detectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location generally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only when the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a population-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly half of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared to a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in a detector network.</description>

      <title>Observing Double White Dwarfs with the Lunar GW Antenna</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector that will observe in the decihertz (dHz) frequency region. In this band, binary white dwarf systems are expected to merge, emitting gravitational waves. Detecting this emission opens new perspectives for understanding the Type Ia supernova progenitors and for investigating dense matter physics. In this work, we present the capabilities of LGWA to detect and localize short-period double white dwarfs in terms of sky locations and distances. The analysis is performed using a realistic spatial distribution of sources, merger rates, and binary-mass distributions derived from current population synthesis models. The simulated population of double white dwarfs is generated using the SeBa stellar-evolution code, coupled with dedicated sampling algorithms. The performance of the LGWA detector, both in terms of signal detectability and parameter estimation, is assessed using standard gravitational-wave data analysis techniques, including Fisher matrix methods, as implemented in the GWFish and Legwork codes. The analysis indicates that LGWA could detect approximately O(30) monochromatic galactic sources and O(10) extragalactic mergers, demonstrating the unique potential of decihertz gravitational-wave detectors to access and characterize extragalactic DWD populations. This will open new avenues for understanding Type Ia supernova progenitors and the physics of DWDs.</description>

      <title>The JADE code. II. Modeling the coupled orbital and atmospheric evolution of GJ 436 b to constrain its migration and companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed architecture and modeled evolution of close-in exoplanets provide crucial insights into their formation pathways and survival mechanisms. To investigate these fundamental questions, we employed JADE, a comprehensive numerical code that models the coupled evolution of atmospheres and dynamics over secular timescales, rooted in present-day observations. JADE integrates photoevaporation with migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) cycles from an external perturber, allowing us to explore evolutionary scenarios where dynamical and atmospheric processes influence each other. Here, we specifically considered GJ 436 b, a warm Neptune with an eccentric orbit and polar spin-orbit angle that has survived within the "hot Neptune desert" despite ongoing atmospheric escape. Our extensive exploration included over 500 000 simulations in a framework that combines precomputed grids with Bayesian inference. This allowed us to constrain GJ 436 b's initial conditions and the properties of its putative companion within a ZLK hypothesis. Our results suggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial atmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout its history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion inducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80{\deg} - 100{\deg} with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit. By combining our explored constraints with radial velocity detection limits, we identified the viable parameter space for the hypothetical GJ 436 c. We found that it strongly disfavors stellar and brown dwarf masses, which offers a useful guide for future observational searches. This work demonstrates how coupled modeling can shed light on the interplay shaping close-in exoplanets and explain the survival of volatile-rich worlds near the edges of the desert.</description>

Abstract: As the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) measures increasingly faint sources, the need for precise polarimetry extraction becomes paramount. In addition to previously described neural-net (NN) weights, we introduce here point-spread function weights and particle background weights, which can be critical for faint sources. In some cases these can be augmented by time/phase and energy weights. We provide a publicly available analysis tool to incorporate these new weights, validate our method on simulated data, and test it on archival IXPE observations. Together these weights decrease the area of the polarization uncertainty contour by a factor of two and will be essential for background-limited IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of multi-parameter likelihoods through iteration of two-dimensional slices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a method for resolving multi-parameter likelihoods by fixing all parameter values, but two. Evaluation of those two variables is followed by iteratively cycling through each of the parameters in turn until convergence. We test the technique on the temperature power spectrum of the lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB). That demonstration is particularly effective since one of the six parameters that define the power spectra, the power spectrum amplitude, $A_{s}$, nears linearity at small deviations, reducing computation to incrementation in one-dimension, rather than over a 2D grid. At each iterative step $A_{s}$ is paired with a different parameter. The iterative process yields parameter values in agreement with those derived by \textit{Planck}, and results are obtained within a few hundred calls for spectra. We further compute parameter values as a function of maximum multipole, $\ell_{\text{max}}$, spanning a range from $\ell_{\text{max}}$=959 to 2500, and uncover bi-modal behavior at the lower end of that range. In the general case, in which neither variable is linear, we identify moderating factors, such as changing both parameters each iterative step, reducing the number of steps per iteration. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation has been the dominant instrument for evaluating multi-parameter functions. For applications with a quasi-linear variable such as, $A_s$, the 2D iterative method is orders of magnitude more efficient than MCMC.</description>

      <title>MADNESS Deblender: Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the unprecedented depth of the upcoming ground-based Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, approximately two-thirds of the galaxies are likely to be affected by blending - the overlap of physically separated galaxies in images. Thus, extracting reliable shapes and photometry from individual objects will be limited by our ability to correct blending and control any residual systematic effect. Deblending algorithms tackle this issue by reconstructing the isolated components from a blended scene, but the most commonly used algorithms often fail to model complex realistic galaxy morphologies.
  As part of an effort to address this major challenge, we present MADNESS, which takes a data-driven approach and combines pixel-level multi-band information to learn complex priors for obtaining the maximum a posteriori solution of deblending. MADNESS is based on deep neural network architectures such as variational auto-encoders and normalizing flows. The variational auto-encoder reduces the high-dimensional pixel space into a lower-dimensional space, while the normalizing flow models a data-driven prior in this latent space.
  Using a simulated test dataset with galaxy models for a 10-year LSST survey and a galaxy density ranging from 48 to 80 galaxies per arcmin2 we characterize the aperture-photometry g-r color, structural similarity index, and pixel cosine similarity of the galaxies reconstructed by MADNESS. We compare our results against state-of-the-art deblenders including scarlet. With the r-band of LSST as an example, we show that MADNESS performs better than in all the metrics. For instance, the average absolute value of relative flux residual in the r-band for MADNESS is approximately 29% lower than that of scarlet. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Self-Triggering for Extensive Air Showers: Performance and FPGA Feasibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers remains a long-standing challenge, particularly in environments dominated by strong and variable radio-frequency interference. Current radio arrays usually rely on external particle-detector triggers: while this lowers thresholds for vertical showers, it excludes very inclined events, where radio detection is uniquely powerful because the particle cascade is absorbed while the radio pulse remains measurable. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study showing that deep-learning-based triggering can overcome these limitations, operating robustly under realistic high-interference conditions and within the strict latency constraints of large-scale observatories. Using measured noise traces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network was trained and optimised for MHz-scale trigger-trial rates, and its performance was compared to a simple threshold-based trigger, which proved markedly less efficient at the same false-positive rate. The trained model was then quantised with HLS4ML and synthesised with Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA targets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model performance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving microsecond-scale inference latencies.These results show that modern FPGA-based AI inference can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation cosmic-ray observatories, particularly in regions with strong and variable radio backgrounds. This capability unlocks access to weak and highly inclined air-shower signals--even in noisy environments--thereby broadening the energy range, extending sky coverage, and opening the path toward ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with ground-based radio arrays.</description>

      <title>The exact non-Gaussian weak lensing likelihood: A framework to calculate analytic likelihoods for correlation functions on masked Gaussian random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact non-Gaussian joint likelihoods for auto- and cross-correlation functions on arbitrarily masked spherical Gaussian random fields. Our considerations apply to spin-0 as well as spin-2 fields but are demonstrated here for the spin-2 weak-lensing correlation function.
  We motivate that this likelihood cannot be Gaussian and show how it can nevertheless be calculated exactly for any mask geometry and on a curved sky, as well as jointly for different angular-separation bins and redshift-bin combinations. Splitting our calculation into a large- and small-scale part, we apply a computationally efficient approximation for the small scales that does not alter the overall non-Gaussian likelihood shape.
  To compare our exact likelihoods to correlation-function sampling distributions, we simulated a large number of weak-lensing maps, including shape noise, and find excellent agreement for one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional distributions. Furthermore, we compare the exact likelihood to the widely employed Gaussian likelihood and find significant levels of skewness at angular separations $\gtrsim 1^{\circ}$, such that the mode of the exact distributions is shifted away from the mean towards lower values of the correlation function. We find that the assumption of a Gaussian random field for the weak-lensing field is well valid at these angular separations.
  Considering the skewness of the non-Gaussian likelihood, we evaluate its impact on the posterior constraints on $S_8$. On a simplified weak-lensing-survey setup with an area of $10 \ 000 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$, we find that the posterior mean of $S_8$ is around $2.5\%$ higher when using the non-Gaussian likelihood, a shift comparable to the precision of current stage-III surveys.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Procedure to Detect Cosmological Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Next-Generation Terrestrial Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17717</link>

Abstract: Cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds are an exciting science target for next-generation ground-based detectors, as they encode invaluable information about the primordial Universe. However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at $5\,\sigma$ level when $\Omega_\mathrm{ref}\geqslant 2.7\times 10^{-12}/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{obs}/\mathrm{yr}}$, where $T_\mathrm{obs}$ is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of $\lesssim2$ from the sensitivity reached in absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.</description>
