      <title>Quantifying Lifetime Productivity Changes: A Longitudinal Study of 325,000 Late-Career Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on persistence in research productivity over the course of an individual's entire scientific careers. We track 'late-career' scientists (N=324,463) in 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) from 38 OECD countries for up to five decades. We examine the details of their mobility patterns between the top, middle, and bottom productivity classes. Methodologically, we turn a large-scale publication and citation bibliometric dataset into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system emerges as highly immobile: 60% of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and half of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. Our regression analyses show that productivity is highly path dependent: for all disciplines examined, there is a single most important predictor of being a top performer: being a top performer at an earlier career stage.</description>

      <title>The rise of Indo-German collaborative research: 1990-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aims to highlight the growth and development of Indo-German collaborative research over the past three decades. Moreover, this study encompasses an in-depth examination of funding acknowledgements to gain valuable insights into the financial support that underpins these collaborative endeavors. Together with this paper, we provide an openly accessible dataset of Indo-German research articles for further and reproducible research activities (the "Indo-German Literature Dataset"). The data were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database from the year 1990 till the 30th of November 2022. A total of 36,999 records were retrieved against the employed query. Acknowledged entities were extracted using a NER model specifically trained for this task. Interrelations between the extracted entities and scientific domains, lengths of acknowledgement texts, number of authors and affiliations, number of citations, and gender of the first author, as well as collaboration patterns between Indian and German funders were examined. The study brings to light that Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Engineering prominently dominate the Indo-German collaborative research. The United States, followed by England and France, are the most active collaborators in Indian and German research. Additionally, relations between entity, entity type, and scientific domain, were discovered. The study highlights a deeper understanding of the composition of the Indo-German collaborative research landscape of the last 30 years and its significance in advancing scientific knowledge and fostering international partnerships. Furthermore, we provide an open version of the original WoS dataset. The Indo-German Literature Dataset consists of 22,844 articles from OpenAlex and is available for related studies like literature studies and Scientometrics.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Automatic Approach to Create Large Gender- and Age-Balanced Speaker Corpora: Usefulness of Speaker Diarization &amp; Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semi-automatic approach to create a diachronic corpus of voices balanced for speaker's age, gender, and recording period, according to 32 categories (2 genders, 4 age ranges and 4 recording periods). Corpora were selected at French National Institute of Audiovisual (INA) to obtain at least 30 speakers per category (a total of 960 speakers; only 874 have be found yet). For each speaker, speech excerpts were extracted from audiovisual documents using an automatic pipeline consisting of speech detection, background music and overlapped speech removal and speaker diarization, used to present clean speaker segments to human annotators identifying target speakers. This pipeline proved highly effective, cutting down manual processing by a factor of ten. Evaluation of the quality of the automatic processing and of the final output is provided. It shows the automatic processing compare to up-to-date process, and that the output provides high quality speech for most of the selected excerpts. This method shows promise for creating large corpora of known target speakers.</description>
