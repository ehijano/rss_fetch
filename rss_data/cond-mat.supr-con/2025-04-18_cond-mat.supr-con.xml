      <title>Symmetry Aspects of Chiral Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in theory, synthesis, and experimental probes of quantum systems have revealed many suitable candidate materials to host chiral superconductivity. Chiral superconductors are a subset of unconventional superconductors which break time-reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetry breaking is possible given the order parameter's two-component nature, allowing for a complex relative phase. In this article, we focus on discussing the underlying symmetry aspects that allow for the development of chiral superconductivity. We provide an introductory account of key concepts in group theory and apply these to the classification of order parameters and the generalization of the Landau theory of phase transitions in the context of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A scaling relation of vortex-induced rectification effects in a superconducting thin-film heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercurrent rectification, nonreciprocal response of superconducting properties sensitive to the polarity of bias and magnetic field, has attracted growing interest as an ideal diode. While the superconducting rectification effect is a consequence of the asymmetric vortex pinning, the mechanisms to develop its asymmetric potentials have been a subject of ongoing debate, mainly focusing on microscopic breaking of spatial inversion symmetry and macroscopic imbalance of the sample structure. Here, we report on comparative study of the superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance in a superconducting Fe(Se,Te)/FeTe heterostructure. In normal state, we observe finite nonreciprocal resistance as a hallmark of the spin-orbit interaction with structural inversion asymmetry. In the superconducting state, we find that the strongly enhanced nonreciprocal coefficient in transition regime is directly coupled to the superconducting diode efficiency through a universal scaling law, indicating the role of spin-momentum-locked state on the asymmetric pinning potential. Our findings, providing a unified picture of the superconducting rectification, pave the way for functionalizing superconducting diode devices.</description>

      <title>Crystal growth, structure and physical properties of quasi-one-dimensional tellurides Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$</title>

Abstract: A new ternary compound Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) with Ti5Te4-type structure is identified. Fe and V atoms tend to occupy different crystallographic positions and form quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Fe-V chains along the c-axis. Millimeter-sized single crystal of Fe$_{2.99}$VTe$_{3.26}$ (FVT) with slender-stick shape could be grown by chemical vapor transport method which reflects its quasi-1D crystal structure. Magnetization measurements reveal that FVT orders antiferromagnetically below T$_N$=93 K with strong easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy. Although a weak glassy-like behavior appears below 10 K, FVT is dominant by long-range antiferromagnetic order in contrast to the spin-glass state in previously reported isostructural Fe$_{5}$Te$_{4}$. We also synthesize V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ with similar quasi-1D V-chains and find it has weak anomalies at 144 K on both resistivity and susceptibility curves. However, no clear evidence is found for the development of magnetic or charge order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Curie-Weiss fit reveal that the effective moments for Fe$^{2+}$ and V$^{4+}$ in both compounds have large deviations from the conventional local moment model, which may possibly result from the formation of Fe/V metal-metal bondings. Furthermore the resistivity of both FVT and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ exhibits semiconducting-like temperature-dependent behavior but with average values close to typical bad metals, which resembles the transport behavior in the normal state of Fe-based superconductors. These quasi-1D compounds have shown interesting physical properties for future condensed matter physics research.</description>

      <title>Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer Nickelate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.</description>

      <title>Topologically enabled superconductivity: possible implications for rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Upper critical fields in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers</title>

Abstract: The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. At low applied in-plane magnetic fields and temperatures close to the zero field transition temperature, we find a possible deviation from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional behavior in the Ti and Pt trilayers. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, all of our trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from an in-plane to an out-of-plane applied magnetic field, with the greatest suppression observed in trilayers with Au or Al. This suppression of the critical temperature under field rotation might appear analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials; however, in our trilayers, only conventional orbital screening contributions to the suppression are present and the additional suppression is not present in the absence of applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Current-induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. Therein, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory for this phenomenon using a model that encapsulates valley polarization and trigonal warping inherent to the trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We elucidate that threefold-degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized, and establish the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current that manifests the switching behavior of different FF states. We thereby propose a scenario that predicts CIZRS in the presence of domains of different FF states: The incipient superconducting state in small current is naturally understood as a multi-domain state, wherein the inter-domain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create mono-domain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction fails to generate these zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.</description>

      <title>The effects of disorder in superconducting materials on qubit coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.</description>
