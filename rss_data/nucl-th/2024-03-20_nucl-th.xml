      <title>Mixed Species Charge and Baryon Balance Functions Studies with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed species charge and baryon balance functions are computed based on proton--proton (pp) collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 model. Simulations are performed with selected values of the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the Monash tune and the Ropes and Shoving modes of PYTHIA8 to explore whether such measurements provide useful new information and constraints on mechanisms of particle production in pp collisions. Charge balance functions are studied based on mixed pairs of pions, kaons, and protons, whereas baryon balance functions are computed for mixed low mass strange and non-strange baryons. Both charge and baryon balance functions of mixed particle pairs feature shapes and amplitudes that sensitively depend on the particle considered owing largely to the particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA. The evolution of balance functions integrals with the longitudinal width of the acceptance are presented and one finds that sums of such integrals for a given reference particle obey expected sum rules for both charge and baryon balance functions. Additionally, both types of balance functions are found to evolve in shape and amplitude with increasing collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ and the PYTHIA tunes considered.</description>

      <title>Revisiting shear stress tensor evolution: Non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop second-order relativistic viscous magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) derived from kinetic theory within an extended relaxation time approximation (momentum/energy dependent) for the collision kernel. The investigation involves a detailed examination of shear stress tensor evolution equations and associated transport coefficients. The Boltzmann equation is solved using a Chapman-Enskog-like gradient expansion for a charge-conserved conformal system, incorporating a momentum-dependent relaxation time. The derived relativistic non-resistive, viscous second-order MHD equations for the shear stress tensor reveal significant modifications in the coupling with dissipative charge current and magnetic field due to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. By utilizing a power law parametrization to quantify the momentum dependence of the relaxation time, the anisotropic magnetic field-dependent shear coefficients in the Navier-Stokes limit have been investigated. The resulting viscous coefficients are seen to be sensitive to the momentum dependence of the relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Systems with Kadanoff-Baym Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

      <title>Shell-model study for allowed and forbidden $\beta^-$ decay properties in the "south" region of $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale shell-model calculations have been performed for the neutron-rich nuclei in the south region of $^{208}$Pb in the nuclear chart. The weak interaction properties, such as the $\log ft$, average shape factor values, half-lives, and neutron emission probabilities, are calculated for these neutron-rich nuclei with the help of newly developed effective interaction [Yuan et al., Phys. Rev. C 106, 044314 (2022)] for $^{208}$Pb region. These calculations have been performed without truncation for a particular model space, however, for some nuclei, a certain truncation has been employed and particle-hole excitations are included in the case of core-breaking nuclei. An extensive comparison with the experimental data has been made and spin parities of several states have been proposed. In this study, we have considered 270 transitions.</description>

      <title>Theory of non-linear diffusion with a physical gapped mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a system with one conserved charge the charge diffusion is modified by non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of diffusive fluctuations. We include the slowest ultraviolet (UV) mode, constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad metal system. Furthermore, the retarded density-density Green's function acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability. We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>An alternative to perturbative renormalization in 3+1 dimensional field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>
