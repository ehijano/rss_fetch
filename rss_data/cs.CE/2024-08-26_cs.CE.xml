      <title>Controllable Financial Market Generation with Diffusion Guided Meta Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order flow modeling stands as the most fundamental and essential financial task, as orders embody the minimal unit within a financial market. However, current approaches often result in unsatisfactory fidelity in generating order flow, and their generation lacks controllability, thereby limiting their application scenario. In this paper, we advocate incorporating controllability into the market generation process, and propose a Diffusion Guided meta Agent(DiGA) model to address the problem. Specifically, we utilize a diffusion model to capture dynamics of market state represented by time-evolving distribution parameters about mid-price return rate and order arrival rate, and define a meta agent with financial economic priors to generate orders from the corresponding distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits outstanding controllability and fidelity in generation. Furthermore, we validate DiGA's effectiveness as generative environment for downstream financial applications.</description>

      <title>Extremal Structures with Embedded Pre-Failure Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preemptive identification of potential failure under loading of engineering structures is a critical challenge. Our study presents an innovative approach to built-in pre-failure indicators within multiscale structural designs utilizing the design freedom of topology optimization. The indicators are engineered to visibly signal load conditions approaching the global critical buckling load. By showing non-critical local buckling when activated, the indicators provide early warning without compromising the overall structural integrity of the design. This proactive safety feature enhances design reliability. With multiscale analysis, macroscale stresses are related to microscale buckling stability. This relationship is applied through tailored stress constraints to prevent local buckling in general while deliberately triggering it at predefined locations under specific load conditions. Experimental testing of 3D-printed designs confirms a strong correlation with numerical simulations. This not only demonstrates the feasibility of creating structures that can signal the need for load reduction or maintenance but also significantly narrows the gap between theoretical optimization models and their practical application. This research contributes to the design of safer structures by introducing built-in early-warning failure systems.</description>

      <title>EUR-USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors, businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate forecasting through multi-source data integration.</description>

      <title>Disentangle VAE for Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic molecule generation plays an important role on drug discovery and has received a great deal of attention in recent years thanks to deep learning successful use. Graph-based neural network represents state of the art methods on automatic molecule generation. However, it is still challenging to generate molecule with desired properties, which is a core task in drug discovery. In this paper, we focus on this task and propose a Controllable Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (C JTVAE), adding an extractor module into VAE framework to describe some properties of molecule. Our method is able to generate similar molecular with desired property given an input molecule. Experimental results is encouraging.</description>

      <title>A plastic correction algorithm for full-field elasto-plastic finite element simulations : critical assessment of predictive capabilities and improvement by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new local plastic correction algorithm that is aimed at accelerating elasto-plastic finite element (FE) simulations for structural problems exhibiting localised plasticity (around e.g. notches, geometrical defects). The proposed method belongs to the category of generalised multi-axial Neuber-type methods, which process the results of an elastic prediction point-wise in order to calculate an approximation of the full elasto-plastic solution. The proposed algorithm relies on a rule of local proportionality, which, in the context of J2 plasticity, allows us to express the plastic plastic correction problem in terms of the amplitude of the full mechanical tensors only. This lightweight correction problem can be solved for numerically using a fully implicit time integrator that shares similarities with the radial return algorithm. The numerical capabilities of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated for a notched structure and a specimen containing a distribution of spherical pores, subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. As a second point of innovation, we show that the proposed local plastic correction algorithm can be further accelerated by employing a simple meta-modelling strategy, with virtually no added errors. At last, we develop and investigate the merits of a deep-learning-based corrective layer designed to the approximation error of the plastic corrector. A convolutional architecture is used to analyse the neighbourhoods of material points and outputs a scalar correction to the point-wise Neuber-type predictions. This optional brick of the proposed plastic correction methodology relies on the availability of a set of full elasto-plastic finite element solutions to be used as training data-set.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials, with their symmetrical and periodic structures, possess a diverse array of properties and have been widely used in various fields, ranging from electronic devices to energy applications. To discover crystalline materials, traditional experimental and computational approaches are often time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and accelerating theoretical computations. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic research to summarize their correlations, distinctions, and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in deep learning-based material discovery in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in material discovery tasks. We also point out the remaining challenges and propose several future directions. This review offers comprehensive and valuable insights, and fosters progress in the intersection of artificial intelligence and material science.</description>
