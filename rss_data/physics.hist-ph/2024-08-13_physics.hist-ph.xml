      <title>The trouble with pilot-wave theory: a critical evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objections to pilot-wave theory frequently come in three mutually-contradictory categories: that the theory is too bizarrely different from ordinary physics, that the theory is not radically different enough, and that the physics of pilot-wave theory is after all just the same as quantum physics. After a brief review of pilot-wave theory, we critically evaluate these objections. We show how the radical nature of pilot-wave theory is often misunderstood or overlooked. We highlight the novelty of its dynamics, and clarify its implications for our understanding of measurement, as well as discussing the status of Lorentz invariance, conservation laws, and the Born rule. We examine Einstein's early work on pilot-wave theory and argue that he turned away from it for reasons which are no longer compelling. We urge that the theory be understood on its own terms, as a generalised nonequilibrium theory empirically distinct from quantum mechanics, with all its potentially revolutionary implications.</description>

      <title>Observability and Predictability in Quantum and Post-Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I introduce a framework to distinguish two domains of physics - the manifest (i.e. the directly observable empirical records in terms of manifest configurations) and the non-manifest domain of physics (i.e. the things that the manifest configurations signify according to a physical theory). I show that many quantum 'paradoxes' rest on ambiguous reasoning about the two domains. More concretely, I study so-called 'surrealistic' trajectories, the 'delayed choice quantum eraser', and 'weak measurements'. Finally, I show how the alleged puzzles resolve in the framework provided. I then formally define and address the question of whether quantum uncertainty could be fundamental or whether post-quantum theories could have predictive advantage whilst conforming to the Born rule on average. This notion of what I call 'empirical completeness' refers to actual prediction-making beyond the Born probabilities, and thus delineates the operational notion of predictability from a 'hidden variable' programme in quantum theory. I study how empirical completeness connects to signal-locality, and argue that a partial proof for the impossibility of predictive advantage can be established for bi-partite quantum systems. The relevant results demonstrate signal-locality as a sufficient principle that might explain the fundamental chanciness in present and future quantum theories and, in turn, reconciles us to many quantum features as aspects of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing William Lane Craig's Explanation of Absolute Time based on Mulla Sadra's Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After the advent of the theory of special relativity, the existence of absolute time in nature was rejected within the society of physics. In recent decades, William Lane Craig has endeavoured to offer an interpretation of the empirical evidence that support the theory of relativity while maintaining the concept of absolute time. His interpretation, however, is based upon supernatural presuppositions due to which it cannot be accepted as a scientific argument. Here, after explaining Craig's view, we attempt to reconstruct his explanation for absolute time using the concept of general substantial motion of nature, well-known in Mulla Sadra's philosophy as the most important approach in Islamic philosophy; thereby, proving general time for the natural world. Although Craig considers some evidence from modern physics in his reasoning for absolute time, in this paper, after pointing to some evidence, it is discussed that the approach used here better bridges the gap that exists between the metaphysics and the physics of the argument.</description>

      <title>Stagnant Lakatosian Research Programmes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the classical dichotomous categorization of research programmes into progress and degeneration according to Lakatos in the form of a neutral third category: the stagnant research programme. First, a critical examination of the primary literature with its often criticized definitional gaps justifies such a category. Through a generic derivation of criteria for stagnant programmes, a clear demarcation from progressive and degenerative ones is achieved. An empirical cross-check is subsequently employed for support: Both a series of examples from fundamental physics and a general analysis of today's research landscape also suggest on an empirical level the need to go beyond the traditional Lakatosian conception. Attributing stagnation is entirely in line with Lakatos' original intentions, which aimed not to hastily discard promising research but to exercise patience until the lifting of certain external constraints potentially enables progress once again.</description>
