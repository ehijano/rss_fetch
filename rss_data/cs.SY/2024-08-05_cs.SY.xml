      <title>An Extreme Value Theory Approach for Understanding Queue Length Dynamics in Adaptive Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach employing extreme value theory to analyze queue lengths within a corridor controlled by adaptive controllers. We consider the maximum queue lengths of a signalized corridor consisting of nine intersections every two minutes, roughly equivalent to the cycle length. Our research shows that maximum queue lengths at all the intersections follow the extreme value distributions. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first attempt to characterize queue length time series using extreme value analysis. These findings are significant as they offer a mechanism to assess the extremity of queue lengths, thereby aiding in evaluating the effectiveness of the adaptive signal controllers and corridor management. Given that extreme queue lengths often precipitate spillover effects, this insight can be instrumental in preempting such scenarios.</description>

      <title>A reference frame-based microgrid primary control for ensuring global convergence to a periodic orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power systems with growing penetration of renewable generation face problems of frequency oscillation and increased uncertainty as the operating point may veer close to instability. Traditionally the stability of these systems is studied either in terms of local stability or as an angle synchronization problem under the simplifying assumption that decouples the amplitude along with all dissipations. Without the simplifying assumption, however, the steady state being studied is basically a limit cycle with the convergence of its orbit in question. In this paper we present an analysis of the orbital stability of a microgrid integrating the proposed type of distributed generation controller, whose internal reference voltage arises from the rotation of the reference frame much like a rotating machine. We utilize the shifted passivity framework to prove that, with sufficient dissipation, such system is globally convergent to a nontrivial orbit. This is the first global stability result for the limit cycle of such system in the full state space, which provides new insight into the synchronization mechanism as well as how dissipation plays a role in the orbital stability. The proposed controller is verified with a test microgrid, demonstrating its stability and transient smoothness compared to the standard droop control.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control with Offline-Online Neural Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safety-critical control framework for an ego agent moving among other agents. The approach infers the dynamics of the other agents, and incorporates the inferred quantities into the design of control barrier function (CBF)-based controllers for the ego agent. The inference method combines offline and online learning with radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). The RBFNNs are initially trained offline using collected datasets. To enhance the generalization of the RBFNNs, the weights are then updated online with new observations, without requiring persistent excitation conditions in order to enhance the applicability of the method. Additionally, we employ adaptive conformal prediction to quantify the estimation error of the RBFNNs for the other agents' dynamics, generating prediction sets to cover the true value with high probability. Finally, we formulate a CBF-based controller for the ego agent to guarantee safety with the desired confidence level by accounting for the prediction sets of other agents' dynamics in the sampled-data CBF conditions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stop-and-go waves reconstruction via iterative refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves are a fundamental phenomenon in freeway traffic flow, contributing to inefficiencies, crashes, and emissions. Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, I24-WaveX, comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic measurement enhancement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic data enhancement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We also open-sourced our trained model and code to facilitate further research and applications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Dynamical Properties of Safety Filters for Linear Planar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamical properties of closed-loop systems obtained from control barrier function-based safety filters. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of undesirable equilibria and show that the Jacobian matrix of the closed-loop system evaluated at an undesirable equilibrium always has a nonpositive eigenvalue. In the special case of linear planar systems and ellipsoidal obstacles, we give a complete characterization of the dynamical properties of the corresponding closed-loop system. We show that for underactuated systems, the safety filter always introduces a single undesired equilibrium, which is a saddle point. We prove that all trajectories outside the global stable manifold of such equilibrium converge to the origin. In the fully actuated case, we discuss how the choice of nominal controller affects the stability properties of the closed-loop system. Various simulations illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Multibeam Hybrid Transmitarray Based on Polarization Rotating Metasurface With Reconfigurable Bidirectional Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a bidirectional multibeam hybrid transmitarray (HTA) employing a transmission polarization-rotating metasurface (TPRM). A novel configuration is introduced to facilitate bidirectional beam scanning by combining the transmitarray (TA) and folded-transmitarray (FTA). To accomplish the reconfiguration of both unidirectional and bidirectional radiation states in the +z, -z, and +/-z directions, a polarization switchable multi-feed array (MFA) is placed at the focal plane between the TA and FTA, radiating x-polarization, y-polarization, and 45-degree oblique polarization waves, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed antenna can achieve multibeam radiation in the three aforementioned states by switching the polarization of the MFA. To demonstrate the operating principle, a prototype has been designed, simulated, and fabricated. The measured results agree well with the simulated results. The simulated and measured results indicate that the proposed design can generate reconfigurable multibeam in both forward and backward directions, either separately or simultaneously. In the unidirectional states, forward and backward beam scanning is achieved within an angular range of +/-30{\deg} and +/-22{\deg}, respectively, with peak gains of 23.6 dBi and 23.1 dBi. A simultaneous forward and backward beam scanning of +/-40{\deg} and +/-22{\deg} is achieved in the hybrid radiation state, with peak gains of 19.4 dBi and 19.3 dBi, respectively. The proposed antenna array design offers several advantages, including bidirectional low-loss beam scanning, a simple structure, low power consumption, and a low profile.</description>

      <title>Practical Guidelines for Data-driven Identification of Lifted Linear Predictors for Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifted linear predictor (LLP) is an artificial linear dynamical system designed to predict trajectories of a generally nonlinear dynamical system based on the current state (or measurements) and the input. The main benefit of the LLP is its potential ability to capture the nonlinear system's dynamics with precision superior to other linearization techniques, such as local linearization about the operation point. The idea of lifting is supported by the theory of Koopman Operators. For LLP identification, we focus on the data-driven method based on the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) algorithm. However, while the EDMD algorithm presents an extremely simple and efficient way to obtain the LLP, it can also yield poor results. In this paper, we present some less intuitive practical guidelines for data-driven identification of the LLPs, aiming at improving usability of LLPs for designing control. We support the guidelines with two motivating examples. The implementation of the examples are shared on a public repository.</description>

      <title>Relax, Estimate, and Track: a Simple Battery State-of-charge and State-of-health Estimation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery management stands as a critical component of ubiquitous battery-powered energy systems, in which battery state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimation are of crucial importance. Conventional SOC and SOH estimation methods, especially model-based methods, often lack accurate modeling of the open circuit voltage (OCV), have high computational complexity, and lack theoretical analysis. In this paper, a simple SOC and SOH estimation method that overcomes all these weaknesses is introduced. The method is based on rigorous theoretical analysis, requires no parameter fine-tuning, and has a very low computational complexity, which is hundreds of times faster than conventional methods. The method is validated on six batteries at different C rates and temperatures, demonstrating a stronger capability to realize fast and accurate estimation under various conditions than other methods, with a SOH root mean square error (RMSE) of around 2.5% and a SOC RMSE of around 1.5%.</description>

      <title>On Game Based Distributed Decision Approach for Multi-agent Optimal Coverage Problem with Application to Constellations Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal coverage problem (OCP) for multi-agent systems with decentralized optimization. A game based distributed decision approach for the the multi-agent OCP is proposed. The equivalence between the equilibrium of the game and the extreme value of the global performance objective is strictly proved. Then, a distributed algorithm only using local information to obtain the global near-optimal coverage is developed, and its convergence is proved. Finally, the proposed method is applied to maximize the covering time of a satellite constellation for a target. The simulation results under different scenarios show our method costs much less computation time under some level index than traditional centralized optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

      <title>Strategic Coalitions in Networked Contest Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation formulations multiple agents compete over different contests by committing their limited resources in them. For these settings, contest games offer a game-theoretic foundation to analyze how players can efficiently invest their resources. In this class of games the resulting behavior can be affected by external interactions among the players. In particular, players could be able to make coalitions that allow transferring resources among them, seeking to improve their outcomes. In this work, we study bilateral budgetary transfers in contest games played over networks. Particularly, we characterize the family of networks where there exist mutually beneficial bilateral transfer for some set of systems parameters. With this in mind, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of mutually beneficial transfers. Moreover, we provide a constructive argument that guarantees that the benefit of making coalitions only depends on mild connectivity conditions of the graph structure. Lastly, we provide a characterization of the improvement of the utilities as a function of the transferred budget. Further, we demonstrate how gradient-based dynamics can be utilized to find desirable coalitional structures. Interestingly, our findings demonstrate that such collaborative opportunities extend well beyond the typical "enemy-of-my-enemy" alliances.</description>

      <title>A Quantal Response Analysis of Defender-Attacker Sequential Security Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario involving two sites and a sequential game between a defender and an attacker, where the defender is responsible for securing the sites while the attacker aims to attack them. Each site holds a loss value for the defender when compromised, along with a probability of successful attack. The defender can reduce these probabilities through security investments at each site. The attacker's objective is to target the site that maximizes the expected loss for the defender, taking into account the defender's security investments. While previous studies have examined security investments in such scenarios, our work investigates the impact of bounded rationality exhibited by the defender, as identified in behavioral economics. Specifically, we consider quantal behavioral bias, where humans make errors in selecting efficient (pure) strategies. We demonstrate the existence of a quantal response equilibrium in our sequential game and analyze how this bias affects the defender's choice of optimal security investments. Additionally, we quantify the inefficiency of equilibrium investments under quantal decision-making compared to an optimal solution devoid of behavioral biases. We provide numerical simulations to validate our main findings.</description>

      <title>Learning with Linear Function Approximations in Mean-Field Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on mean-field type multi-agent control problems where the dynamics and cost structures are symmetric and homogeneous, and are affected by the distribution of the agents. A standard solution method for these problems is to consider the infinite population limit as an approximation and use symmetric solutions of the limit problem to achieve near optimality. The control policies, and in particular the dynamics, depend on the population distribution in the finite population setting, or the marginal distribution of the state variable of a representative agent for the infinite population setting. Hence, learning and planning for these control problems generally require estimating the reaction of the system to all possible state distributions of the agents. To overcome this issue, we consider linear function approximation for the control problem and provide several coordinated and independent learning methods. We rigorously establish error upper bounds for the performance of learned solutions. The performance gap stems from (i) the mismatch due to estimating the true model with a linear one, and (ii) using the infinite population solution in the finite population problem as an approximate control. The provided upper bounds quantify the impact of these error sources on the overall performance.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Lyapunov-Based Investigation of the Effect of Stenosis on Blood Transport Stability Using a Control-Theoretic PDE Model of Cardiovascular Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform various numerical tests to study the effect of (boundary) stenosis on blood flow stability, employing a detailed and accurate, second-order finite-volume scheme for numerically implementing a partial differential equation (PDE) model, using clinically realistic values for the artery's parameters and the blood inflow. The model consists of a baseline $2\times 2$ hetero-directional, nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system, in which, the stenosis' effect is described by a pressure drop at the outlet of an arterial segment considered. We then study the stability properties (observed in our numerical tests) of a reference trajectory, corresponding to a given time-varying inflow (e.g., a periodic trajectory with period equal to the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats) and stenosis severity, deriving the respective linearized system and constructing a Lyapunov functional. Due to the fact that the linearized system is time varying, with time-varying parameters depending on the reference trajectories themselves (that, in turn, depend in an implicit manner on the stenosis degree), which cannot be derived analytically, we verify the Lyapunov-based stability conditions obtained, numerically. Both the numerical tests and the Lyapunov-based stability analysis show that a reference trajectory is asymptotically stable with a decay rate that decreases as the stenosis severity deteriorates.</description>

      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling with Multiple Surface Directions along with Throughput Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles have gained immense popularity in the delivery drone market and are now being developed for passenger transportation in urban areas to efficiently enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM). UAM aims to utilize the urban airspace \hidetxt{vertical dimension} to address the problem of heavy road congestion in dense urban cities. VTOL vehicles require vertiport terminals for landing, take-off, passengers boarding or deboarding, refuelling (or charging), and maintenance. An efficient scheduling algorithm is essential to maximize the throughput of the vertiport terminal (vertiminal)\hidetxt{ as well as efficient use of airspace} while maintaining safety protocols to handle the UAM traffic. While traditional departure and taxiing operations can be applied in the context of vertiminal, specific algorithms are required for take-off and landing schedules. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft that require a runway to take-off and climb in a single direction, VTOL vehicles can approach and climb in several directions. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to schedule flights for taxiing, climbing (or approaching) using multiple directions after take-off (before landing) and turnaround on gates. We also derived equations to thoroughly analyze the throughput capacity of a vertiminal considering all its core elements. We have shown that our MILP can achieve the maximum throughput obtained through the equations. Given the input parameters, our analysis can be used to analyze the capacity of a vertiminal without running any simulation, while our MILP can be used to get the most efficient schedule.</description>

      <title>Metareasoning in uncertain environments: a meta-BAMDP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decision-making scenarios, \textit{reasoning} can be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome such as maximizing the value function of a Markov decision process (MDP). However, executing $P$ itself may bear some costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Such costs need to be taken into account in order to accurately model human behavior, as well as optimizing AI planning, as all physical systems are bound to face resource constraints. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to two-armed Bernoulli bandit (TABB) tasks, which have often been used to study human decision making. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate, but nevertheless robust within a range of assumptions that are arguably realistic for human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints. This integration of Bayesian adaptive strategies with metareasoning enriches both the theoretical landscape of decision-making research and practical applications in designing AI systems that plan under uncertainty and resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Certified Robust Invariant Polytope Training in Neural Controlled ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control system modeled as an ordinary differential equation subject to disturbance, with a state feedback controller parameterized as a feedforward neural network. We propose a framework for training controllers with certified robust forward invariant polytopes, where any trajectory initialized inside the polytope remains within the polytope, regardless of the disturbance. First, we parameterize a family of lifted control systems in a higher dimensional space, where the original neural controlled system evolves on an invariant subspace of each lifted system. We use interval analysis and neural network verifiers to further construct a family of lifted embedding systems, carefully capturing the knowledge of this invariant subspace. If the vector field of any lifted embedding system satisfies a sign constraint at a single point, then a certain convex polytope of the original system is robustly forward invariant. Treating the neural network controller and the lifted system parameters as variables, we propose an algorithm to train controllers with certified forward invariant polytopes in the closed-loop control system. Through two examples, we demonstrate how the simplicity of the sign constraint allows our approach to scale with system dimension to over $50$ states, and outperform state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based sampling approaches in runtime.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially to move freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity on the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Uncertainty for a Separation Principle in Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method for complex system regulation, but its reliance on an accurate model poses many limitations in real-world applications. Data-driven predictive control (DDPC) aims at overcoming this limitation, by relying on historical data to provide information on the plant to be controlled. In this work, we present a unified stochastic framework for direct DDPC, where control actions are obtained by optimizing the Final Control Error (FCE), which is directly computed from available data only and automatically weighs the impact of uncertainty on the control objective. Our framework allows us to establish a separation principle for Predictive Control, elucidating the role that predictive models and their uncertainty play in DDPC. Moreover, it generalizes existing DDPC methods, like regularized Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and $\gamma$-DDPC, providing a path toward noise-tolerant data-based control with rigorous optimality guarantees. The theoretical investigation is complemented by a series of numerical case studies, revealing that the proposed method consistently outperforms or, at worst, matches existing techniques without requiring tuning regularization parameters as other methods do.</description>

      <title>Showcasing Automated Vehicle Prototypes: A Collaborative Release Process to Manage and Communicate Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development and deployment of automated vehicles pose major challenges for manufacturers to this day. Whilst central questions, like the issue of ensuring a sufficient level of safety, remain unanswered, prototypes are increasingly finding their way into public traffic in urban areas. Although safety concepts for prototypes are addressed in literature, published work hardly contains any dedicated considerations on a systematic release for their operation. In this paper, we propose an incremental release process for public demonstrations of prototypes' automated driving functionality. We explicate release process requirements, derive process design decisions, and define stakeholder tasks. Furthermore, we reflect on practical insights gained through implementing the release process as part of the UNICAR$agil$ research project, in which four prototypes based on novel vehicle concepts were built and demonstrated to the public. One observation is the improved quality of internal risk communication, achieved by dismantling information asymmetries between stakeholders. Design conflicts are disclosed - providing a contribution to nurture transparency and, thereby, supporting a valid basis for release decisions. We argue that our release process meets two important requirements, as the results suggest its applicability to the domain of automated driving and its scalability to different vehicle concepts and organizational structures.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-aided Edge Learning in Distribution System State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) plays a crucial role in the real-time monitoring, control, and operation of distribution networks. Besides intensive computational requirements, conventional DSSE methods need high-quality measurements to obtain accurate states, whereas missing values often occur due to sensor failures or communication delays. To address these challenging issues, a forecast-then-estimate framework of edge learning is proposed for DSSE, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to forecast missing measurements and provide pseudo-measurements. Firstly, natural language-based prompts and measurement sequences are integrated by the proposed LLM to learn patterns from historical data and provide accurate forecasting results. Secondly, a convolutional layer-based neural network model is introduced to improve the robustness of state estimation under missing measurement. Thirdly, to alleviate the overfitting of the deep learning-based DSSE, it is reformulated as a multi-task learning framework containing shared and task-specific layers. The uncertainty weighting algorithm is applied to find the optimal weights to balance different tasks. The numerical simulation on the Simbench case is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecast-then-estimate framework.</description>

      <title>Phase Re-service in Reinforcement Learning Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel approach to traffic signal control that combines phase re-service with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL agent directly determines the duration of the next phase in a pre-defined sequence. Before the RL agent's decision is executed, we use the shock wave theory to estimate queue expansion at the designated movement allowed for re-service and decide if phase re-service is necessary. If necessary, a temporary phase re-service is inserted before the next regular phase. We formulate the RL problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) and solve it with proximal policy optimization (PPO). We conducted a series of experiments that showed significant improvements thanks to the introduction of phase re-service. Vehicle delays are reduced by up to 29.95% of the average and up to 59.21% of the standard deviation. The number of stops is reduced by 26.05% on average with 45.77% less standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Transfer Learning for Traffic Optimization with Coarse-grained Advisory Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies has spurred investigations to optimize dense urban traffic to maximize vehicle speed and throughput. This paper explores advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued to the human drivers, thus achieving near-term performance of automated vehicles. Due to the complexity of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have resorted to leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL). Coarse-grained advisory is formalized as zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold duration from 0.1 to 40 seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher frequency tasks on CAVs, a direct application of deep RL fails to be generalized to advisory autonomy tasks. To overcome this, we utilize zero-shot transfer, training policies on a set of source tasks--specific traffic scenarios with designated hold durations--and then evaluating the efficacy of these policies on different target tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select source tasks for zero-shot transfer, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Graph-based Learning Method for Sub-band Allocation in 6G Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach for frequency sub-band allocation in wireless networks using graph-based learning. We consider a dense deployment of subnetworks in the factory environment with a limited number of sub-bands which must be optimally allocated to coordinate inter-subnetwork interference. We model the subnetwork deployment as a conflict graph and propose an unsupervised learning approach inspired by the graph colouring heuristic and the Potts model to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph neural networks. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information. We further demonstrate that the method is robust to different network settings.</description>

      <title>Towards Model-Free LQR Control over Rate-Limited Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the success of model-free methods for control design in many problem settings, it is natural to ask how things will change if realistic communication channels are utilized for the transmission of gradients or policies. While the resulting problem has analogies with the formulations studied under the rubric of networked control systems, the rich literature in that area has typically assumed that the model of the system is known. As a step towards bridging the fields of model-free control design and networked control systems, we ask: \textit{Is it possible to solve basic control problems - such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem - in a model-free manner over a rate-limited channel?} Toward answering this question, we study a setting where a worker agent transmits quantized policy gradients (of the LQR cost) to a server over a noiseless channel with a finite bit-rate. We propose a new algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (\texttt{AQGD}), and prove that above a certain finite threshold bit-rate, \texttt{AQGD} guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with \textit{no deterioration of the exponent relative to the unquantized setting}. More generally, our approach reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast linear convergence rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the literature on compressed optimization.</description>

      <title>DASA: Delay-Adaptive Multi-Agent Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a setting in which $N$ agents aim to speedup a common Stochastic Approximation (SA) problem by acting in parallel and communicating with a central server. We assume that the up-link transmissions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. To mitigate the effect of delays and stragglers while reaping the benefits of distributed computation, we propose \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent Stochastic Approximation. We provide a finite-time analysis of \texttt{DASA} assuming that the agents' stochastic observation processes are independent Markov chains. Significantly advancing existing results, \texttt{DASA} is the first algorithm whose convergence rate depends only on the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$ and on the average delay $\tau_{avg}$ while jointly achieving an $N$-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling. Our work is relevant for various SA applications, including multi-agent and distributed temporal difference (TD) learning, Q-learning and stochastic optimization with correlated data.</description>
