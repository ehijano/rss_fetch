      <title>Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological organisms thrive by adapting to their environments, which are often unpredictably changeable. We apply recent results from nonequilibrium physics to show that organisms' fitness parses into a static generalist component and a nonequilibrium tracking component. Our findings: (1) Environmental changes that are too fast or too small are not worth tracking. (2) Well-timed anticipatory tracking enhances fitness in coherent environments. (3) We compute and explain the optimal adaptive strategy for a system in a given environment, such as bet hedging or phenotypic memory. Conversely, (4) We compute and explain the optimal way for an environment to control a given system, for example for designing drug regimens to limit the growth of pathogens. By connecting fitness, adaptive strategy, and environmental variability, this work provides the foundations for a generic physical theory of adaptivity.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and quench dynamics in the thermally perturbed tricritical fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Blume-Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling-limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-living oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for (i) the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and (ii) branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Long-range Order in a Short-range Quasi-2D XY Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase of spins in the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) XY model has emerged as a topic of significant interest across multiple physics subfields. Here, we propose a short-range (SR) Q2D XY model defined on a plane perpendicularly intersected by a group of parallel planes, with each plane consisting of nearest-neighbor-coupled XY spins. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by finite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model when the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR correlations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while critical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered phase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of LR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue to explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19832v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.</description>

      <title>Dissipative quantum North-East-Center model: steady-state phase diagram, universality and nonergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model: a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition. Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear order.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Phase-Separated Interfaces in Inhomogenous and Driven Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive effective equations of motion governing the dynamics of sharp interfaces in phase-separated binary mixtures driven by spatio-temporal modulations of their material properties. We demonstrate, in particular, that spatial heterogeneities in the surface tension induce an effective capillary force that drives the motion of interfaces, even in the absence of hydrodynamics. Applying our sharp interface model to quantify the dynamics of thermophoretic droplets, we find that their deformation and transport properties are controlled by a combination of bulk and capillary forces, whose relative strength depends on droplet size. Strikingly, we show that small thermophobic droplets -- composed of a material with a positive Soret coefficient -- can spontaneously migrate towards high-temperature regions as a result of capillary forces.</description>

      <title>An information-theoretic proof of the Planckian bound for thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum mechanics entails a fundamental lower bound on the thermalization time $\tau$ of any system. At finite temperature, we show that $\tau$ is bounded by half the Planckian dissipation time, $\tau \geq \tau_{\rm Pl}/2$ with $\tau_{\rm Pl} = \hbar/(k_{\rm B} T)$. In the low-temperature regime, our bound takes the form $\tau \geq \hbar / \Delta$ with $\Delta$ the spectral gap, in close connection with the quantum adiabatic theorem. These bounds, rooted in Hamiltonian estimation, hold for arbitrary quantum processes that output states close to the corresponding thermal ensemble for a nontrivial class of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of
  equilibrium configurations of
  a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined
  on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory
  effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive
  Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately
  following a power-law.
  This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory
  behavior of the potential energy surface.
  This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria
  for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles.
  However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the
  observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around
  values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity.
  Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria,
  which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of thermodynamics: Maxwell relations for pair correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold enormous promise for advancing the modelling of materials and understanding emergent physics, such as high temperature superconductivity and topological order. While correlation functions are, typically, straightforward to measure in quantum simulators, thermodynamic properties are not. This limits our ability to directly compare the results of quantum simulations to experiments on the materials being modelled. Maxwell relations are an extremely powerful tool for characterising complex materials, as they enable the determination of challenging-to-measure thermodynamic properties from more accessible ones. Here, we introduce generalised Maxwell relations that relate every thermodynamic quantity to a single local correlation function. We illustrate their utility by deducing the thermodynamic properties of several iconic quantum many-body models from pair correlation functions using the generalised Maxwell relations. We show that this {universal} approach is readily accessible in quantum simulators and suggest applications to condensed matter systems where thermodynamic measurements are challenging, such as atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Elastic heterogeneity governs anomalous scaling in a soft porous crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale molecular transport plays a crucial role in regulating mass diffusion and responsiveness in condensed matter systems. In soft porous crystals, in particular, adsorption of guest molecules induces host framework deformation and changes in rigidity, underpinning their characteristic stimuli-responsive behaviour. Surface-mediated adsorption leads to inhomogeneous adsorbate distribution, which, through local framework deformation, induces spatial variations in rigidity -- elastic heterogeneity. Although this heterogeneity is expected to affect adsorption kinetics and mechanical behaviour, its role remains poorly understood. Here we show that elastic heterogeneity governs adsorption kinetics, leading to emergent phenomena including size-dependent uptake, surface creasing, and anomalous dynamic scaling that is distinct from established scaling. Stress relaxation near corners facilitates adsorption, resulting in a size-dependent deviation from diffusive kinetics. Away from corners, flexible unadsorbed regions between rigid adsorbed domains relieve stress through crease formation. The resulting lateral correlations exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling, characterized by a breakdown of scale invariance between global and local interfacial fluctuations. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for controlling adsorption and deformation kinetics in soft porous materials via elastic heterogeneity. Our work opens a route to engineering responsive materials, where mechanical feedback is harnessed to control cooperative molecular transport and drive macroscopic shape changes under external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing quantum resourcefulness via group-Fourier decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a general framework for studying the resourcefulness in pure states for quantum resource theories (QRTs) whose free operations arise from the unitary representation of a group. We argue that the group Fourier decompositions (GFDs) of a state, i.e., its projection onto the irreducible representations (irreps) of the Hilbert space, operator space, and tensor products thereof, constitute fingerprints of resourcefulness and complexity. By focusing on the norm of the irrep projections, dubbed GFD purities, we find that low-resource states live in the small dimensional irreps of operator space, whereas high-resource states have support in more, and higher dimensional ones. Such behavior not only resembles that appearing in classical harmonic analysis, but is also universal across the QRTs of entanglement, fermionic Gaussianity, spin coherence, and Clifford stabilizerness. To finish, we show that GFD purities carry operational meaning as they lead to resourcefulness witnesses as well as to notions of state compressibility.</description>

      <title>Weak unitary symmetries of open quantum dynamics: beyond quantum master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Markovian open quantum dynamics with weak unitary symmetries. Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state. Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.</description>

Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, is known to show a second-order (symmetry breaking) phase transition in two-dimension (2D) for $q\le 4$ ($q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model). On the other hand, the $q\to\infty$ limit of the model corresponds to the $XY$ model, which shows the infinite order (non-symmetry breaking) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in 2D. Interestingly, the 2D clock model with $q\ge 5$ is predicted to show three different phases and two associated phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of phases and the associated transitions. In this work, we develop the basic and higher-order mean-field (MF) theories to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Our MF calculations reaffirm that, for large $q$, there are three phases: (broken) $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetric ferromagnetic phase at the low temperature, emergent $U(1)$ symmetric BKT phase at the intermediate temperature, and paramagnetic (disordered) phase at the high temperature. The phase transition at the higher temperature is found to be of the BKT type, and the other transition at the lower temperature is argued to be a large-order spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type (the largeness of transition order yields the possibility of having some of the numerical characteristics of a BKT transition). The higher-order MF theory developed here better characterizes phases by estimating the spin-spin correlation between two neighbors.</description>

      <title>The Nonclassical Regime of the Two-dimensional Long-range XY Model: a Comprehensive Monte Carlo Study</title>

Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) XY model plays a crucial role in statistical and condensed matter physics. With the introduction of long-range interactions, the system exhibits a richer set of physical phenomena and a crossover between non-classical and short-range universality classes.In this work, we investigate the 2D XY model with algebraically decaying interactions $\sim 1/r^{2+\sigma}$, and provide a comprehensive numerical analysis of its thermodynamic properties. We demonstrate that for $\sigma \leq 2$, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition into a ferromagnetic phase characterized by the emergence of long-range order. In the low-temperature phase, due to the presence of the Goldstone mode, the correlation function saturates to a non-zero constant in the form of a power law for $\sigma &lt; 2$, with decaying exponent $2-\sigma$, and in the form of the inverse logarithm of distance for $\sigma=2$. Moreover, the critical points and exponents are also determined for various $\sigma$. We provide compelling evidence that the crossover between non-classical and short-range regimes occurs at $\sigma=2$. This work presents a detailed account of the simulation methodology, extensive numerical data, and new insights into the physics of long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>A comparative review of recent results on supercritical anomalies in two-dimensional kinetic Ising and Blume-Capel ferromagnets</title>

Abstract: Following the unexpected experimental discovery of ``sideband'' peaks in the fluctuation spectrum of thin Co films driven by a slowly oscillating magnetic field with a constant bias [P.~Riego et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 117202 (2017)] numerical studies of two-state Ising and three-state Blume-Capel (BC) ferromagnets in this dynamically supercritical regime have flourished and been successful in explaining this phenomenon. Here, we give a comparative review of this new literature and its connections to earlier work. Following an introduction and a presentation of the two models and the computational method used in many of these studies, we present numerical results for both models. Particular attention is paid to the fact that zero spins in the BC model tend to collect at he interfaces between regions of the two nonzero spin values, +/-1. We present strong arguments that this phenomenon leads to a reduction of the effective interface tension in the BC model, compared to the Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium systems exchange information in addition to energy. In information thermodynamics, the information flow is characterized by the learning rate, which is not invariant under coordinate transformations. To formalize the property of the learning rate under variable transformations, we introduce a learning rate matrix. This matrix has the learning rates as its diagonal elements and characterizes the changes in the learning rates under linear coordinate transformations. The maximal eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the learning rate matrix gives the maximal information flow under orthogonal transformations. Furthermore, we derive a new trade-off relation between the learning rate and the heat dissipation of a subsystem. Finally, we illustrate the results using analytically solvable yet experimentally feasible models.</description>

Abstract: We develop information theory for the temporal behavior of memoryful agents moving through complex -- structured, stochastic -- environments. We introduce information processes -- stochastic processes produced by cognitive agents in real-time as they interact with and interpret incoming stimuli. We provide basic results on the ergodicity and semantics of the resulting time series of Shannon information measures that monitor an agent's adapting view of uncertainty and structural correlation in its environment.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

Abstract: Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time evolution of the lattice Thirring model quenched out of equilibrium in both the critical and massive phases and study the appearance of dynamical quantum phase transitions, as nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt rate. Although the presence of a dynamical quantum phase transition in the model does not correspond to quenches across the critical line of the equilibrium phase diagram at zero temperature, we identify a threshold in the energy density of the initial state, necessary for a dynamical quantum phase transition to be present. Moreover, in the case of the gapped quench Hamiltonian, we unveil a connection of this threshold to a transition between different regions in the finite-temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization for secure and efficient quantum random state generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomness is a cornerstone of science, underpinning fields such as statistics, information theory, dynamical systems, and thermodynamics. In quantum science, quantum randomness, especially random pure states, plays a pivotal role in fundamental questions like black hole physics and quantum complexity, as well as in practical applications such as quantum device benchmarking and quantum advantage certification. The conventional approach for generating genuine random states, called `deep thermalization', faces significant challenges, including scalability issues due to the need for a large ancilla system and susceptibility to attacks, as demonstrated in this work. We introduce holographic deep thermalization, a secure and hardware-efficient quantum random state generator. By adopting a sequential application of a scrambling-measure-reset process, it continuously trades space with time, and substantially reduces the required ancilla size to as small as a system-size independent constant; At the same time, it guarantees security by removing quantum correlation between the data system and attackers. Thanks to the resource reduction, our circuit-based implementation on IBM Quantum devices achieves genuine $5$-qubit random state generation utilizing only a total of $8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations -- made tractable by the RBM's structure -- we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Operator growth in many-body systems of higher spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator growth in many-body systems with on-site spins larger than $1/2$, considering both non-integrable and integrable regimes. Specifically, we compute Lanczos coefficients in the one- and two-dimensional Ising models for spin values $S=1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$, and observe asymptotically linear growth $b_n \sim n$. On the integrable side, we investigate the Potts model and find square-root growth $b_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Both results are consistent with the predictions of the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. To analyze operator dynamics in this setting, we employ a generalized operator basis constructed from tensor products of shift and clock operators, extending the concept of Pauli strings to higher local dimensions. We further report that the recently introduced formalism of equivalence classes of Pauli strings can be naturally extended to this setting. This formalism enables the study of simulable Heisenberg dynamics by identifying dynamically isolated operator subspaces of moderate dimensionality. As an example, we introduce the Kitaev-Potts model with spin-$1$, where the identification of such a subspace allows for exact time evolution at a computational cost lower than that of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>
