      <title>SiamQuality: A ConvNet-Based Foundation Model for Imperfect Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models, especially those using transformers as backbones, have gained significant popularity, particularly in language and language-vision tasks. However, large foundation models are typically trained on high-quality data, which poses a significant challenge, given the prevalence of poor-quality real-world data. This challenge is more pronounced for developing foundation models for physiological data; such data are often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. The present work aims to provide a toolset for developing foundation models on physiological data. We leverage a large dataset of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from hospitalized intensive care patients. For this data, we propose SimQuality, a novel self-supervised learning task based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone to enforce representations to be similar for good and poor quality signals that are from similar physiological states. We pre-trained the SimQuality on over 36 million 30-second PPG pairs and then fine-tuned and tested on six downstream tasks using external datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on all the downstream tasks, which are extremely important for heart monitoring on wearable devices. Our method indicates that CNNs can be an effective backbone for foundation models that are robust to training data quality.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated as an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, current research has concentrated on minimizing a standard distortion metric such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), which does not necessarily improve the perceptual quality. To address this issue, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the realism of images transmitted over the channel. The proposed DiffJSCC utilizes prior deep JSCC frameworks to deliver an initial reconstructed image at the receiver. Then, the spatial and textual features are extracted from the initial reconstruction, which, together with the channel state information (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, SNR), are passed to a control module to fine-tune the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the Kodak dataset reveal that our method significantly surpasses both conventional methods and prior deep JSCC approaches on perceptual metrics such as LPIPS and FID scores, especially with poor channel conditions and limited bandwidth. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR. Our code will be released in https://github.com/mingyuyng/DiffJSCC.</description>

      <title>Dual-Functional Waveform Design with Local Sidelobe Suppression via OTFS Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key technology in future wireless networks. One of the main challenges in realizing ISAC is developing dual-functional waveforms that can communicate with communication receivers and perform radar sensing simultaneously. In this paper, we consider the joint design of a dual-functional orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) signal and a receiving filter for the ISAC system. The problem of ISAC waveform design is formulated as the minimization of the weighted integrated sidelobe level (WISL) of the ambiguity function and the interference term from ISAC waveform, with constraints on signal-to-noise ratio loss. The majorization-minimization algorithm combined with alternating iterative minimization is implemented to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that the WISL and the interference term can be significantly decreased to guarantee achievable data rates and detection performance.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis for Downlink Transmission in Multi-Connectivity Cellular V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing number of connected vehicles in the fifth-generation mobile communication networks (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G), ensuring the reliability and high-speed demand of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication in scenarios where vehicles are moving at high speeds poses a significant challenge.Recently, multi-connectivity technology has become a promising network access paradigm for improving network performance and reliability for C-V2X in the 5G and B5G era. To this end, this paper proposes an analytical framework for the performance of downlink in multi-connectivity C-V2X networks. Specifically, by modeling the vehicles and base stations as one-dimensional Poisson point processes, we first derive and analyze the joint distance distribution of multi-connectivity. Then through leveraging the tools of stochastic geometry, the coverage probability and spectral efficiency are obtained based on the previous results for general multi-connectivity cases in C-V2X. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of path loss exponent and the density of downlink base station on system performance indicators. We demonstrate through extensive Monte Carlo simulations that multi-connectivity technology can effectively enhance network performance in C-V2X. Our findings have important implications for the research and application of multi-connectivity C-V2X in the 5G and B5G era.</description>

      <title>3D Extended Object Tracking by Fusing Roadside Sparse Radar Point Clouds and Pixel Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roadside perception is a key component in intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional (3D) extended object tracking (EOT) method, which simultaneously estimates the object kinematics and extent state, in roadside perception using both the radar and camera data. Because of the influence of sensor viewing angle and limited angle resolution, radar measurements from objects are sparse and non-uniformly distributed, leading to inaccuracies in object extent and position estimation. To address this problem, we present a novel spherical Gaussian function weighted Gaussian mixture model. This model assumes that radar measurements originate from a series of probabilistic weighted radar reflectors on the vehicle's extent. Additionally, we utilize visual detection of vehicle keypoints to provide additional information on the positions of radar reflectors. Since keypoints may not always correspond to radar reflectors, we propose an elastic skeleton fusion mechanism, which constructs a virtual force to establish the relationship between the radar reflectors on the vehicle and its extent. Furthermore, to better describe the kinematic state of the vehicle and constrain its extent state, we develop a new 3D constant turn rate and velocity motion model, considering the complex 3D motion of the vehicle relative to the roadside sensor. Finally, we apply variational Bayesian approximation to the intractable measurement update step to enable recursive Bayesian estimation of the object's state. Simulation results using the Carla simulator and experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in comparison to several state-of-the-art 3D EOT methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Federated Learning in Cooperative Communication within Factory Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates energy-efficient transmission protocols in relay-assisted federated learning (FL) setup within industrial subnetworks, considering latency and power constraints. In the subnetworks, devices collaborate to train a global model by transmitting their local models at the edge-enabled primary access (pAP) directly or via secondary access points (sAPs), which act as relays to optimize the training latency. We begin by formulating the energy efficiency problem for our proposed transmission protocol. Given its non-convex nature, we decompose it to minimize computational and transmission energy separately. First, we introduce an algorithm that categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop groups to decrease transmission energy and then selects associated sAPs. Subsequently, we optimize the transmit power, aiming to maximize energy efficiency. To that end, we propose a Sequential Parametric Convex Approximation (SPCA) method to configure system parameters jointly. Simulation results show a 5% improvement in convergence, significantly reduced outage, and at least a twofold savings in total energy achieved by our proposed algorithm compared to single-hop transmission.</description>

      <title>Fast Beam Training and Performance Analysis for Extremely Large Aperture Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture array (ELAA) can significantly enhance beamforming gain and spectral efficiency. Unfortunately, the use of narrower beams for data transmission results in a substantial increase in the cost of beam training. In this paper, we study a high-efficiency and low-overhead scheme named hash beam training. Specifically, two improved hash codebook design methods, random and fixed, are proposed. Moreover, we analyze beam alignment performance. Since the derived beam alignment success probability is a complex function, we also propose a heuristic metric to evaluate the impact of codebook parameter on performance. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, indicating that the proposed beam training scheme can achieve fast beam alignment with lower overhead and higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Downlink Pilots are Essential for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Antenna Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive MIMO system with multiple antennas on the users and access points. In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well when having single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent since the effective channel matrix does not harden when having multi-antenna users. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme and derive a new SE expression that utilizes zero-forcing combining. We show numerically how the number of users and user antennas affects the SE.</description>

      <title>Enhancing RSS-Based Visible Light Positioning by Optimal Calibrating the LED Tilt and Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal calibration scheme and a weighted least squares (LS) localization algorithm for received signal strength (RSS) based visible light positioning (VLP) systems, focusing on the often overlooked impact of light emitting diode (LED) tilt. By optimally calibrating LED tilt and gain, we significantly enhance VLP localization accuracy. Our algorithm outperforms both machine learning Gaussian processes (GPs) and traditional multilateration techniques. Against GPs, it achieves improvements of 58% and 74% in the 50th and 99th percentiles, respectively. When compared to multilateration, it reduces the 50th percentile error from 7.4 cm to 3.2 cm and the 99th percentile error from 25.7 cm to 11 cm. We introduce a low-complexity estimator for tilt and gain that meets the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the mean squared error (MSE), emphasizing its precision and efficiency. Further, we elaborate on optimal calibration measurement placement and refine the observation model to include residual calibration errors, thereby improving localization performance. The weighted LS algorithm's effectiveness is validated through simulations and real-world data, consistently outperforming GPs and multilateration, across various training set sizes and reducing outlier errors. Our findings underscore the critical role of LED tilt calibration in advancing VLP system accuracy and contribute to a more precise model for indoor positioning technologies.</description>

      <title>Location-Based Load Balancing for Energy-Efficient Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) has emerged as a potential enabler for future networks. It has been shown that these networks are much more energy-efficient than classical cellular systems when they are serving users at peak capacity. However, these CF mMIMO networks are designed for peak traffic loads, and when this is not the case, they are significantly over-dimensioned and not at all energy efficient. To this end, Adaptive Access Point (AP) ON/OFF Switching (ASO) strategies have been developed to save energy when the network is not at peak traffic loads by putting unnecessary APs to sleep. Unfortunately, the existing strategies rely on measuring channel state information between every user and every access point, resulting in significant measurement energy consumption overheads. Furthermore, the current state-of-art approach has a computational complexity that scales exponentially with the number of APs. In this work, we present a novel convex feasibility testing method that allows checking per-user Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements without necessarily considering all possible access point activations. We then propose an iterative algorithm for activating access points until all users' requirements are fulfilled. We show that our method has comparable performance to the optimal solution whilst avoiding solving costly mixed-integer problems and measuring channel state information on only a limited subset of APs.</description>

      <title>NeuroNet: A Novel Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Sleep Stage Classification Using Single-Channel EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of sleep stages is a pivotal aspect of diagnosing sleep disorders and evaluating sleep quality. However, the conventional manual scoring process, conducted by clinicians, is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Recent advancements in deep learning have substantially propelled the automation of sleep stage classification. Nevertheless, challenges persist, including the need for large datasets with labels and the inherent biases in human-generated annotations. This paper introduces NeuroNet, a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed to effectively harness unlabeled single-channel sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by integrating contrastive learning tasks and masked prediction tasks. NeuroNet demonstrates superior performance over existing SSL methodologies through extensive experimentation conducted across three polysomnography (PSG) datasets. Additionally, this study proposes a Mamba-based temporal context module to capture the relationships among diverse EEG epochs. Combining NeuroNet with the Mamba-based temporal context module has demonstrated the capability to achieve, or even surpass, the performance of the latest supervised learning methodologies, even with a limited amount of labeled data. This study is expected to establish a new benchmark in sleep stage classification, promising to guide future research and applications in the field of sleep analysis.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Fusion of Sparse Spatial Features for Integrated Sensing and Edge AI over Broadband Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 6G mobile networks are differentiated from 5G by two new usage scenarios - distributed sensing and edge AI. Their natural integration, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), promised to create a platform for enabling environment perception to make intelligent decisions and take real-time actions. A basic operation in ISEA is for a fusion center to acquire and fuse features of spatial sensing data distributed at many agents. To overcome its communication bottleneck due to multiple access by numerous agents over hostile wireless channels, we propose a novel framework, called Spatial Over-the-Air Fusion (Spatial AirFusion), which exploits radio waveform superposition to aggregate spatially sparse features over the air. The technology is more sophisticated than conventional Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) as it supports simultaneous aggregation over multiple voxels, which partition the 3D sensing region, and across multiple subcarriers. Its efficiency and robustness are derived from exploitation of both spatial feature sparsity and multiuser channel diversity to intelligently pair voxel-level aggregation tasks and subcarriers to maximize the minimum receive SNR among voxels under instantaneous power constraints. To optimally solve the mixed-integer Voxel-Carrier Pairing and Power Allocation (VoCa-PPA) problem, the proposed approach hinges on two useful results: (1) deriving the optimal power allocation as a closed-form function of voxel-carrier pairing and (2) discovering a useful property of VoCa-PPA that dramatically reduces the solution-space dimensionality. Both a low-complexity greedy algorithm and an optimal tree-search based approach are designed for VoCa-PPA. Extensive simulations using real datasets show that Spatial AirFusion achieves significant error reduction and accuracy improvement compared with conventional AirComp without awareness of spatial sparsity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a clustering technique based on information rates for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Unlike existing clustering approaches that rely on the large scale fading coefficients of the channels and user-centric techniques, we develop an approach that is based on the information rates of cell-free massive MIMO networks. We also devise a resource allocation technique to incorporate the proposed clustering and schedule users with fairness. An analysis of the proposed clustering approach based on information rates is carried out along with an assessment of its benefits for scheduling. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques outperform existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Tightly-Coupled VLP/INS Integrated Navigation by Inclination Estimation and Blockage Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology capable of delivering indoor localization with high accuracy. In VLP systems that use Photodiodes (PDs) as light receivers, the Received Signal Strength (RSS) is affected by the incidence angle of light, making the inclination of PDs a critical parameter in the positioning model. Currently, most studies assume the inclination to be constant, limiting the applications and positioning accuracy. Additionally, light blockages may severely interfere with the RSS measurements but the literature has not explored blockage detection in real-world experiments. To address these problems, we propose a tightly coupled VLP/INS (Inertial Navigation System) integrated navigation system that uses graph optimization to account for varying PD inclinations and VLP blockages. We also discussed the possibility of simultaneously estimating the robot's pose and the locations of some unknown LEDs. Simulations and two groups of real-world experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, achieving an average positioning accuracy of 10 cm during movement and inclination accuracy within 1 degree despite inclination changes and blockages.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Powered Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a movable antenna (MA) enhanced scheme for wireless powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) system, where the hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple MAs first emits wireless energy to charge wireless devices (WDs), and then receives the offloaded tasks from the WDs for edge computing. The MAs deployed at the HAP enhance the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by flexibly adjusting the positions of MAs within an available region, thereby improving the efficiency of both downlink wireless energy transfer (WPT) and uplink task offloading. To balance the performance enhancement against the implementation intricacy, we further propose three types of MA positioning configurations, i.e., dynamic MA positioning, semi-dynamic MA positioning, and static MA positioning. In addition, the non-linear power conversion of energy harvesting (EH) circuits at the WDs and the finite computing capability at the edge server are taken into account. Our objective is to maximize the sum computational rate (SCR) by jointly optimizing the time allocation, positions of MAs, energy beamforming matrix, receive combing vectors, and offloading strategies of WDs. To solve the non-convex problems, efficient alternating optimization (AO) frameworks are proposed. Moreover, we propose a hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization with variable local search (PSO-VLS) to solve the sub-problem of MA positioning. Numerical results validate the superiority of exploiting MAs over the fixed-position antennas (FPAs) for enhancing the SCR performance of WP-MEC systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in the Era of 6G Communications</title>

Abstract: Wireless information and energy transfer (WIET) represents an emerging paradigm which employs controllable transmission of radio-frequency signals for the dual purpose of data communication and wireless charging. As such, WIET is widely regarded as an enabler of envisioned 6G use cases that rely on energy-sustainable Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, such as smart cities and smart grids. Meeting the quality-of-service demands of WIET, in terms of both data transfer and power delivery, requires effective co-design of the information and energy signals. In this article, we present the main principles and design aspects of WIET, focusing on its integration in 6G networks. First, we discuss how conventional communication notions such as resource allocation and waveform design need to be revisited in the context of WIET. Next, we consider various candidate 6G technologies that can boost WIET efficiency, namely, holographic multiple-input multiple-output, near-field beamforming, terahertz communication, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), and reconfigurable (fluid) antenna arrays. We introduce respective WIET design methods, analyze the promising performance gains of these WIET systems, and discuss challenges, open issues, and future research directions. Finally, a near-field energy beamforming scheme and a power-based IRS beamforming algorithm are experimentally validated using a wireless energy transfer testbed. The vision of WIET in communication systems has been gaining momentum in recent years, with constant progress with respect to theoretical but also practical aspects. The comprehensive overview of the state of the art of WIET presented in this paper highlights the potentials of WIET systems as well as their overall benefits in 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Sampling in Fractional Fourier Domain: Recovery Guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling theory in fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) domain has been studied extensively in the last decades. This interest stems from the ability of the FrFT to generalize the traditional Fourier Transform, broadening the traditional concept of bandwidth and accommodating a wider range of functions that may not be bandlimited in the Fourier sense. Beyond bandlimited functions, sampling and recovery of sparse signals has also been studied in the FrFT domain. Existing methods for sparse recovery typically operate in the transform domain, capitalizing on the spectral features of spikes in the FrFT domain. Our paper contributes two new theoretical advancements in this area. First, we introduce a novel time-domain sparse recovery method that avoids the typical bottlenecks of transform domain methods, such as spectral leakage. This method is backed by a sparse sampling theorem applicable to arbitrary FrFT-bandlimited kernels and is validated through a hardware experiment. Second, we present Cram\'er-Rao Bounds for the sparse sampling problem, addressing a gap in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Beampattern Design for Transmit Architectures Based on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of beampattern design for a transmit architecture wherein a large reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) redirects the radio frequency signals emitted by a few active antennas (sources). After introducing a convenient signal model and discussing the impact of the signal bandwidth, the source-RIS channel, and the system geometry on the involved derivations, we propose to optimize the waveform emitted by each source and the phase shifts introduced by the RIS to match a desired space-frequency distribution of the far-field radiation pattern, which may be relevant in both radar and communication applications. We provide a sub-optimum solution to the considered problem under a constraint on the total power radiated by the sources and, possibly, on the constant modulus of the involved waveforms. The reported example demonstrates that the beampattern of an RIS-based transmit architecture can be well shaped; in particular, for the same array size and the same desired radiation pattern, the resulting approximation error remains comparable to that obtained with a fully-digital MIMO array, especially when constant-modulus waveforms are required, and smaller than that obtained with a phased array.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Method using Effective Demodulation and Decomposition Techniques allowing Identification of Disturbing Loads in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents an innovative approach to identifying voltage fluctuation sources in power networks, also considering the localization understood as the indication of supply points of disturbing loads. The presented approach considers disturbance sources that change their operating state with a frequency higher than the power frequency. The implementation of the proposed solution is also proposed in such a way that its implementation in the smart meter infrastructure allows automatic localization of disturbance sources without additional expert knowledge. In the proposed approach, the modulation signal is estimated using a carrier signal estimator, which allows the estimation of a modulation signal with a frequency higher than the power frequency. The estimated modulating signal is decomposed into component signals associated with individual disturbing loads by decomposition by approximation using pulse waves. The decomposition process allows for the estimation of selected parameters associated with disturbing loads, on the basis of which the assessment of propagation of voltage fluctuations associated with the impact of individual disturbance sources is performed, which allows for the indication of their supply point. The proposed approach was verified in numerical simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULINK and in experimental studies carried out in a real low-voltage power grid.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Heartbeat Signatures: A Vision Transformer Approach to Explainable Atrial Fibrillation Detection from ECG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote patient monitoring based on wearable single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) devices has significant potential for enabling the early detection of heart disease, especially in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for automated heart disease detection. There have been prior studies applying AI approaches based on deep learning for heart disease detection. However, these models are yet to be widely accepted as a reliable aid for clinical diagnostics, in part due to the current black-box perception surrounding many AI algorithms. In particular, there is a need to identify the key features of the ECG signal that contribute toward making an accurate diagnosis, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. In the present study, we develop a vision transformer approach to identify atrial fibrillation based on single-lead ECG data. A residual network (ResNet) approach is also developed for comparison with the vision transformer approach. These models are applied to the Chapman-Shaoxing dataset to classify atrial fibrillation, as well as another common arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and normal sinus rhythm heartbeats. The models enable the identification of the key regions of the heartbeat that determine the resulting classification, and highlight the importance of P-waves and T-waves, as well as heartbeat duration and signal amplitude, in distinguishing normal sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and sinus bradycardia.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient, custom frame synchronization architecture aimed at rapid deployment on any hardware platform. Frame synchronization is the process of discerning valid data frames from an incoming transmission and in this article it is accomplished by attaching distinctive binary overhead sequences on the frame. These sequences act as markers for the frames and enable the capture of their payload. They have certain properties and can be detected by using only simple hardware constructs like XNOR gates and few-bit adders with adequate accuracy. A low-cost commercial FPGA was used for implementation (NEXYS 4 DDR).</description>

      <title>Multi-stream Transmission for Directional Modulation Network via Distributed Multi-UAV-aided Multi-active-IRS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary technique for the future 6G networks. The conventional far-field single-IRS-aided directional modulation(DM) networks have only one (no direct path) or two (existing direct path) degrees of freedom (DoFs). This means that there are only one or two streams transmitted simultaneously from base station to user and will seriously limit its rate gain achieved by IRS. How to create multiple DoFs more than two for DM? In this paper, single large-scale IRS is divided to multiple small IRSs and a novel multi-IRS-aided multi-stream DM network is proposed to achieve a point-to-point multi-stream transmission by creating $K$ ($\geq3$) DoFs, where multiple small IRSs are placed distributively via multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The null-space projection, zero-forcing (ZF) and phase alignment are adopted to design the transmit beamforming vector, receive beamforming vector and phase shift matrix (PSM), respectively, called NSP-ZF-PA. Here, $K$ PSMs and their corresponding beamforming vectors are independently optimized. The weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is involved in alternating iteration for the optimization variables by introducing the power constraint on IRS, named WMMSE-PC, where the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is used to solve the total PSM. To achieve a lower computational complexity, a maximum trace method, called Max-TR-SVD, is proposed by optimize the PSM of all IRSs. Numerical simulation results has shown that the proposed NSP-ZF-PA performs much better than Max-TR-SVD in terms of rate. In particular, the rate of NSP-ZF-PA with sixteen small IRSs is about five times that of NSP-ZF-PA with combining all small IRSs as a single large IRS. Thus, a dramatic rate enhancement may be achieved by multiple distributed IRSs.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional communications transmit all the source data represented by bits, regardless of the content of source and the semantic information required by the receiver. However, in some applications, the receiver only needs part of the source data that represents critical semantic information, which prompts to transmit the application-related information, especially when bandwidth resources are limited. In this paper, we consider a semantic communication system for speech recognition by designing the transceiver as an end-to-end (E2E) system. Particularly, a deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication system, named DeepSC-SR, is developed to learn and extract text-related semantic features at the transmitter, which motivates the system to transmit much less than the source speech data without performance degradation. Moreover, in order to facilitate the proposed DeepSC-SR for dynamic channel environments, we investigate a robust model to cope with various channel environments without requiring retraining. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DeepSC-SR outperforms the traditional communication systems in terms of the speech recognition metrics, such as character-error-rate and word-error-rate, and is more robust to channel variations, especially in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime.</description>

      <title>Origami Single-end Capacitive Sensing for Continuous Shape Estimation of Morphing Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel single-end morphing capacitive sensing method for shape tracking, FxC, by combining Folding origami structures and Capacitive sensing to detect the morphing structural motions using state-of-the-art sensing circuits and deep learning. It was observed through embedding areas of origami structures with conductive materials as single-end capacitive sensing patches, that the sensor signals change coherently with the motion of the structure. Different from other origami capacitors where the origami structures are used in adjusting the thickness of the dielectric layer of double-plate capacitors, FxC uses only a single conductive plate per channel, and the origami structure directly changes the geometry of the conductive plate. We examined the operation principle of morphing single-end capacitors through 3D geometry simulation combined with physics theoretical deduction, which deduced similar behaviour as observed in experimentation. Then a software pipeline was developed to use the sensor signals to reconstruct the dynamic structural geometry through data-driven deep neural network regression of geometric primitives extracted from vision tracking. We created multiple folding patterns to validate our approach, based on folding patterns including Accordion, Chevron, Sunray and V-Fold patterns with different layouts of capacitive sensors using paper-based and textile-based materials. Experimentation results show that the geometry primitives predicted from the capacitive signals have a strong correlation with the visual ground truth with R-squared value of up to 95% and tracking error of 6.5 mm for patches. The simulation and machine learning constitute two-way information exchange between the sensing signals and structural geometry.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>A new method of modeling the multi-stage decision-making process of CRT using machine learning with uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. The purpose of this study is to create a multi-stage machine learning model to predict cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response for heart failure (HF) patients. This model exploits uncertainty quantification to recommend additional collection of single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) variables if baseline clinical variables and features from electrocardiogram (ECG) are not sufficient. Methods. 218 patients who underwent rest-gated SPECT MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 5% at a 6+-1 month follow-up. A multi-stage ML model was created by combining two ensemble models: Ensemble 1 was trained with clinical variables and ECG; Ensemble 2 included Ensemble 1 plus SPECT MPI features. Uncertainty quantification from Ensemble 1 allowed for multi-stage decision-making to determine if the acquisition of SPECT data for a patient is necessary. The performance of the multi-stage model was compared with that of Ensemble models 1 and 2. Results. The response rate for CRT was 55.5% (n = 121) with overall male gender 61.0% (n = 133), an average age of 62.0+-11.8, and LVEF of 27.7+-11.0. The multi-stage model performed similarly to Ensemble 2 (which utilized the additional SPECT data) with AUC of 0.75 vs. 0.77, accuracy of 0.71 vs. 0.69, sensitivity of 0.70 vs. 0.72, and specificity 0.72 vs. 0.65, respectively. However, the multi-stage model only required SPECT MPI data for 52.7% of the patients across all folds. Conclusions. By using rule-based logic stemming from uncertainty quantification, the multi-stage model was able to reduce the need for additional SPECT MPI data acquisition without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Geometrically-Shaped Constellation for Visible Light Communications at Short Blocklength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework of designing geometrically shaped constellations for short-packet visible light communications with a peak- and an average-intensity constraints. By leveraging tools from large deviation theory, we first characterize the second-order asymptotics of the optimal constellation shaping region under aforementioned intensity constraints, which serves as a good performance measure for the best geometric shaping in finite blocklength. To further incorporate a sufficiently large coding gain and a nearly-maximum shaping gain, we construct multidimensional constellations by the nested structure of Construction B lattices, where the constellation shaping is implemented by controlling the boundary of the embedded sublattice, i.e., a strategy called coarsely shaping and finely coding. Fast algorithms for constellation mapping and demodulation are presented as well. As an illustrative example, we present an energy-efficient $24$-dimensional constellation design based on the Leech lattice, whose superiority over existing constellation designs is verified by numerical results.</description>

      <title>On the View-and-Channel Aggregation Gain in Integrated Sensing and Edge AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are two key features of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Their natural integration, termed Integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to automate wide-ranging Internet-of-Tings (IoT) applications. To achieve a high sensing accuracy, multi-view features are uploaded to an edge server for aggregation and inference using an AI model. The view aggregation is realized efficiently using over-the-air computing (AirComp), which also aggregates channels to suppress channel noise. At its nascent stage, ISEA still lacks a characterization of the fundamental performance gains from view-and-channel aggregation, which motivates this work. Our framework leverages a well-established distribution model of multi-view sensing data where the classic Gaussian-mixture model is modified by adding sub-spaces matrices to represent individual sensor observation perspectives. Based on the model, we study the End-to-End sensing (inference) uncertainty, a popular measure of inference accuracy, of the said ISEA system by a novel approach involving designing a scaling-tight uncertainty surrogate function, global discriminant gain, distribution of receive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and channel induced discriminant loss. We prove that the E2E sensing uncertainty diminishes at an exponential rate as the number of views/sensors grows, where the rate is proportional to global discriminant gain. Given channel distortion, we further show that the exponential scaling remains with a reduced decay rate related to the channel induced discriminant loss. Furthermore, we benchmark AirComp against equally fast, traditional analog orthogonal access, which reveals a sensing-accuracy crossing point between the schemes, leading to the proposal of adaptive access-mode switching. Last, the insights from our framework are validated by experiments using real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Radarize: Enhancing Radar SLAM with Generalizable Doppler-Based Odometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is increasingly being considered as an alternative to optical sensors for robotic primitives like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While mmWave radar overcomes some limitations of optical sensors, such as occlusions, poor lighting conditions, and privacy concerns, it also faces unique challenges, such as missed obstacles due to specular reflections or fake objects due to multipath. To address these challenges, we propose Radarize, a self-contained SLAM pipeline that uses only a commodity single-chip mmWave radar. Our radar-native approach uses techniques such as Doppler shift-based odometry and multipath artifact suppression to improve performance. We evaluate our method on a large dataset of 146 trajectories spanning 4 buildings and mounted on 3 different platforms, totaling approximately 4.7 Km of travel distance. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art radar and radar-inertial approaches by approximately 5x in terms of odometry and 8x in terms of end-to-end SLAM, as measured by absolute trajectory error (ATE), without the need for additional sensors such as IMUs or wheel encoders.</description>

Abstract: We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. We investigate coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the benefits of the concatenated scheme at finite lengths.</description>
