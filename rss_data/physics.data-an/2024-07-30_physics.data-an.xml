      <title>SignedLouvain: Louvain for signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the problem of community detection in signed networks. We propose SignedLouvain, an adaptation of the Louvain method to maximise signed modularity, efficiently taking advantage of the structure induced by signed relations. We begin by identifying the inherent limitations of applying the standard Louvain algorithm to signed networks, before introducing a novel variant specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only maintains the speed and scalability of its predecessor but also significantly enhances accuracy in detecting communities within signed networks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Laws in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical laws describe regular patterns observed in diverse scientific domains, ranging from the magnitude of earthquakes (Gutenberg-Richter law) and metabolic rates in organisms (Kleiber's law), to the frequency distribution of words in texts (Zipf's and Herdan-Heaps' laws), and productivity metrics of cities (urban scaling laws). The origins of these laws, their empirical validity, and the insights they provide into underlying systems have been subjects of scientific inquiry for centuries. This monograph provides an unifying approach to the study of statistical laws, critically evaluating their role in the theoretical understanding of complex systems and the different data-analysis methods used to evaluate them. Through a historical review and a unified analysis, we uncover that the persistent controversies on the validity of statistical laws are predominantly rooted not in novel empirical findings but in the discordance among data-analysis techniques, mechanistic models, and the interpretations of statistical laws. Starting with simple examples and progressing to more advanced time-series and statistical methods, this monograph and its accompanying repository provide comprehensive material for researchers interested in analyzing data, testing and comparing different laws, and interpreting results in both existing and new datasets.</description>

      <title>Response Theory via Generative Score Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an approach for analyzing the responses of dynamical systems to external perturbations that combines score-based generative modeling with the Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT). The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, including those with non-Gaussian statistics. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from three different stochastic partial differential equations of increasing complexity: an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with spatially correlated noise, a modified stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of the methodology over conventional methods and discuss its potential as a versatile tool for predicting the statistical behavior of complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Illumination and Quantum Radar: A Brief Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in surrogate modeling is the limited availability of data due to resource constraints associated with computationally expensive simulations. Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>CASTRO -- Efficient constrained sampling method for material and chemical experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of multicomponent material composition space requires significant time and financial investments, necessitating efficient use of resources for statistically relevant compositions. This article introduces a novel methodology, implemented in the open-source CASTRO (ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd) software package, to overcome equality-mixture constraints and ensure comprehensive design space coverage. Our approach leverages Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU) using a divide-and-conquer strategy to manage high-dimensional problems effectively. By incorporating previous experimental knowledge within a limited budget, our method strategically recommends a feasible number of experiments to explore the design space. We validate our methodology with two examples: a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional mixture constraints, yielding specific component distributions. Our constrained sequential LHS or LHSMDU approach enables thorough design space exploration, proving robustness for experimental design. This research not only advances material science but also offers promising solutions for efficiency challenges in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. CASTRO and the case studies are available for free download on GitHub.</description>
