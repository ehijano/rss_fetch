      <title>1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in periodic Gauss law sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the properties of a 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in different Gauss law sectors, corresponding to different configurations of static charges set by the orientations of the gauge spins. Importantly, in quantum simulator experiments these sectors can be accessed without adding any additional physical particles or changing the Hamiltonian: The Gauss law sectors are simply set by the initial conditions. We study the interplay between conservation laws and interactions when the static charges are chosen to form periodic patterns. We classify the different Gauss law sectors and use the density matrix renormalization group to calculate the ground state compressibility, density profiles, charge density wave order parameters, and single particle correlation functions as a function of matter density. We find confined and deconfined phases, charge density waves, correlated insulators, and supersolids.</description>

      <title>On the infrared cutoff for dipolar droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beyond mean-field physics due to quantum fluctuations is often described by the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction, which can be approximately written as a simple analytical expression in terms of the mean-field employing local density approximation. This model has proven to be very successful in predicting the dynamics in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates both qualitatively and quantitatively. Yet, a small deviation between experimental results and the theoretical prediction has been observed when comparing experiment and theory of the phase boundary of a free-space quantum droplet. For this reason, we revisit the theoretical description of quantum fluctuations in dipolar quantum gases. We study alternative cutoffs, compare them to experimental results and discuss limitations.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected quantized changes of the distance between atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thouless pumping enables the transport of particles in a one-dimensional periodic potential if the potential is slowly and periodically modulated in time. The change in the position of particles after each modulation period is quantized and depends solely on the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust against perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that Thouless pumping also allows for the realization of topologically protected quantized changes of the distance between atoms if the atomic s-wave scattering length is properly modulated in time.</description>

      <title>The synthetic gauge field and exotic vortex phase with spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms endowed with tunable spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC) represent a promising avenue for delving into exotic quantum phenomena. Building on recent experimental advancements, we propose the generation of synthetic gauge fields ,and by including exotic vortex phases within spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, employing a combination of a running wave and Laguerre-Gaussian laser fields. We investigate the ground-state characteristics of the SOAMC condensate, revealing the emergence of exotic vortex states with controllable orbital angular momenta. It is shown that the interplay of the SOAMC and conventional spin-linear-momentum coupling induced by the running wave beam leads to the formation of a vortex state exhibiting a phase stripe hosting single multiply quantized singularity. The phase of the ground state will undergo the phase transition corresponding to the breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving the mirror symmetry. Importantly, the observed density distribution of the ground-state wavefunction, exhibiting broken rotational symmetry, can be well characterized by the synthetic magnetic field generated through light interaction with the dressed spin state. Our findings pave the way for further exploration into the rotational properties of stable exotic vortices with higher orbital angular momenta against splitting in the presence of synthetic gauge fields in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Condensate and superfluid fraction of homogeneous Bose gases in a self-consistent Popov approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the condensate and superfluid fraction of a homogeneous gas of weakly interacting bosons in three spatial dimensions by adopting a self-consistent Popov approximation, comparing this approach with other theoretical schemes. Differently from the superfluid fraction, we find that at finite temperature the condensate fraction is a non-monotonic function of the interaction strength, presenting a global maximum at a characteristic value of the gas parameter, which grows as the temperature increases. This non-monotonic behavior has not yet been observed, but could be tested with the available experimental setups of ultracold bosonic atoms confined in a box potential. We clearly identify the region of parameter space that is of experimental interest to look for this behavior and provide explicit expressions for the relevant observables. Finite size effects are also discussed within a semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezer Arrays of Erbium Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first successful trapping of single erbium atoms in an array of optical tweezers. Using a single narrow-line optical transition, we achieve deep cooling for direct tweezer loading, pairwise ejection, and continous imaging without additional recoil suppression techniques. Our tweezer wavelength choice enables us to reach the magic trapping condition by tuning the ellipticity of the trapping light. Additionally, we implement an ultrafast high-fidelity fluorescence imaging scheme using a broad transition, allowing time-resolved study of the tweezer population dynamics from many to single atoms during light-assisted collisions. In particular, we extract a pair-ejection rate that qualitatively agrees with the semiclassical predictions by the Gallagher-Pritchard model. This work represents a promising starting point for the exploration of erbium as a powerful resource for quantum simulation in optical tweezers.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the probability typical distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Superfluidity of Total Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of a U(1) symmetry in interacting systems leads to superfluidity of a corresponding conserved charge. We generalize the superfluidity to systems with U(1) symmetries acting on both matter fields and 2D spatial coordinates. Such systems can be effectively realized in easy-plane ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling where the conserved charge is a total angular momentum. We clarify that under a steady injection of spin angular momentum, the superfluid of the total angular momentum shows spacetime oscillations of the spin density and geometry-dependent spin hydrodynamics. We also demonstrate that the steady spin injection destabilizes the superfluid of total angular momentum, causing a dissipation effect in its spin hydrodynamic properties. Although a stability analysis shows that the superfluid under the spin injection is nonideal, the unique spin-transport features persist with weak dissipation of the spin angular momentum. Our study broadens the comprehension of superfluidity and sheds new light on the interplay between symmetries and phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a new type of collinear magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <title>Robustly learning the Hamiltonian dynamics of a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The required precision to perform quantum simulations beyond the capabilities of classical computers imposes major experimental and theoretical challenges. The key to solving these issues are precise means of characterizing analog quantum simulators. Here, we robustly estimate the free Hamiltonian parameters of bosonic excitations in a superconducting-qubit analog quantum simulator from measured time-series of single-mode canonical coordinates. We achieve high levels of precision in estimating the Hamiltonian parameters by exploiting a priori knowledge, making it robust against noise and state-preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Importantly, we are also able to obtain tomographic information about those SPAM errors from the same data, crucial for the experimental applicability of Hamiltonian learning in dynamical quantum-quench experiments. Our learning algorithm is scalable both in terms of the required amounts of data and post-processing. To achieve this, we develop a new super-resolution technique coined tensorESPRIT for frequency extraction from matrix time-series. The algorithm then combines tensorESPRIT with constrained manifold optimization for the eigenspace reconstruction with pre- and post-processing stages. For up to 14 coupled superconducting qubits on two Sycamore processors, we identify the Hamiltonian parameters -- verifying the implementation on one of them up to sub-MHz precision -- and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our results constitute an accurate implementation of a dynamical quantum simulation that is characterized using a new diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>
