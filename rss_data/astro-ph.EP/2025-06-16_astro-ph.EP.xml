      <title>DBNets2.0: simulation-based inference for planet-induced dust substructures in protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust substructures in protoplanetary discs can be signatures of embedded young planets whose detection and characterisation would provide a better understanding of planet formation. Traditional techniques used to link substructures' morphology to the properties of putative embedded planets present several limitations that the use of deep learning methods has partly overcome. In our previous work, we developed DBNets, a tool exploiting an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate the mass of putative planets in disc dust substructures. This inference problem, however, is degenerate as planets of different masses could produce the same rings and gaps if other physical disc properties were different. In this paper, we address this issue improving our simulation-based inference pipeline to estimate the full posterior distribution for the planet mass and three additional disc properties: the disc $\alpha$-viscosity, the scale height and the dust Stokes number. We also address some minor issues of our previous tool. The new pipeline involves a CNN that summarises the input images in a set of summary statistics, followed by an ensemble of normalising flows that model the inferred posterior for the target properties. We tested our pipeline on a dedicated set of synthetic observations using the TARP test and standard metrics, demonstrating its accuracy and precision. Additionally, we use the results obtained on the test set to study the degeneracies between pairs of parameters. Finally, we apply the developed pipeline to a set of 49 gaps in 34 protoplanetary discs' continuum observations. The results show typically low values of $\alpha$-viscosity, disc scale heights, and planet masses, with 83% of them being lower than 1M$_J$. These low masses are consistent with the non-detections of these putative planets in direct imaging surveys. Our tool is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Potential Danger to Satellites due to Ejecta from a 2032 Lunar Impact by Asteroid 2024 YR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2032 December 22 the 60 m diameter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4% chance of impacting the Moon. Such an impact would release 6.5 MT TNT equivalent energy and produce a ~1 km diameter crater. We estimate that up to 10^8 kg of lunar material could be liberated in such an impact by exceeding lunar escape speed. Depending on the actual impact location on the Moon as much as 10% of this material may accrete to the Earth on timescales of a few days. The lunar ejecta-associated particle fluence at 0.1 - 10 mm sizes could produce upwards of years to of order a decade of equivalent background meteoroid impact exposure to satellites in near-Earth space late in 2032. Our results demonstrate that planetary defense considerations should be more broadly extended to cis-lunar space and not confined solely to near-Earth space.</description>

      <title>A nanosecond-duration radio pulse originating from the defunct Relay 2 satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a burst of emission over a 695.5 MHz-1031.5 MHz bandwidth by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, ASKAP. The burst was localised through analysis of near-field time delays to the long-decommissioned Relay 2 satellite, and exhibited a dispersion measure of $2.26 \cdot 10^{-5}$ pc cm$^{-3}$ -- 69.7 TECU, consistent with expectations for a single pass through the ionosphere. After coherent dedispersion, the burst was determined to be less than 30 ns in width, with an average flux density of at least 300 kJy. We consider an electrostatic discharge (ESD) or plasma discharge following a micrometeoroid impact to be plausible explanations for the burst. ESDs have previously been observed with the Arecibo radio telescope, but on 1000 times longer timescales. Our observation opens new possibilities for the remote sensing of ESD, which poses a serious threat to spacecraft, and reveals a new source of false events for observations of astrophysical transients.</description>

      <title>The mutual influence of disequilibrium composition and temperature in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a 1D planetary atmosphere model that solves in a self-consistent manner the evolution of temperature and disequilibrium chemistry in the vertical direction. Thermochemical kinetics is based on a reaction network built from scratch that includes 164 gaseous species composed of H, C, N, O, S, Si, P, Ti, He, and Ar, connected by 2352 forward reactions. The model is applied to the well-known gas giant exoplanets WASP-33b, HD209458b, HD189733b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b, and to secondary atmospheres that exoplanets characterized in the future may plausibly have. For irradiated gas giants with solar or supersolar metallicity, the corrections to the temperature due to disequilibrium chemistry are relatively small, on the order of 100 K at most, in agreement with previous studies. Although the atmospheric composition of some of these planets deviates significantly from chemical equilibrium, the impact on the temperature is moderate because the abundances of the main atmospheric species that provide opacity, such as H2O, CO2, CO, and/or CH4, are not seriously modified by disequilibrium chemistry. An impact on the temperature greater than 100 K appears in hot Jupiters due to TiO, which is predicted to be seriously depleted by UV photons in the upper layers. However, the extent of this depletion, and thus of its impact on the temperature, is uncertain due to the lack of knowledge about TiO photodestruction. In secondary atmospheres, the impact of disequilibrium chemistry on the temperature depends on the composition. In atmospheres dominated by H2O and/or CO2 the temperature is not affected to an important extent. However, reducing atmospheres dominated by CH4 and oxidizing atmospheres dominated by O2 see their temperature being seriously affected due to the important processing of the atmospheric composition induced by disequilibrium chemistry.</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Exoplanetary Environments and the Search for Signs of Life Beyond Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of exoplanets orbit nearby stars, showcasing a remarkable diversity in mass, size, and orbits. With the James Webb Space Telescope now operational, we are observing exoplanet atmospheres and aiming to reach down to small, habitable-zone exoplanets in search of signs of habitability and possibly even biosignature gases. Given the scarcity of targets, it is imperative to embrace the known diversity and consider the range of exoplanets that might host life. We review how Earth life interacts with various atmospheric gases, noting that bacteria can survive in high concentrations of gases such as H2, He, CO2, and CO. Additionally, we consider the potential for life in alternative solvents and in cloud biospheres where rocky surfaces are excessively hot, as well as in hypothesized planetary global oceans. We highlight that life fundamentally requires metal ions for catalytic reactions, suggesting that environments without surface contact need meteoritic delivery to provide these essential elements. Despite today's observational limits, a suite of next-generation telescopes is being designed specifically for exoplanet studies, promising to expand our capabilities and understanding in the future.</description>

      <title>Inner disc and circumplanetary material in the PDS 70 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two giant protoplanets directly imaged in the dust-depleted cavity of PDS 70 offer a unique opportunity to study ongoing planet formation. Both planets have been detected in infrared thermal emission and in H$\alpha$, indicating active accretion. We calibrate and analyse archival ALMA Band 6 and 7 observations of PDS 70 from 2019, 2021, and 2023 to search for circumplanetary material and assess its motion. Using 2D visibility modelling of the high-resolution (~0.11"x0.08" in Band 6; ~0.05"x0.05" in Band 7) dust continuum from the outer disc, we subtract the model and image the cavity at multiple epochs. We re-detect compact dust emission around PDS 70 c in all datasets with &gt;$3.8\sigma$ significance, and tentatively detect emission near PDS 70 b at ~$3\sigma$ in Band 6, with peak fluxes of $59\pm17\mu$Jy/beam and $46\pm14\mu$Jy/beam. The relative astrometry of the compact emission around PDS 70 c is consistent with the expected position of the planet between 2019-2023. We find a peak flux difference up to $64\pm34\mu$Jy/beam at 1$\sigma$, but Bayesian analysis indicates no significant variability. We detect no flux variability in the inner disc. The inferred dust mass near PDS 70 c and in the inner disc ranges from $0.008$-$0.063 M_\oplus$ and $0.04$-$0.31 M_\oplus$, respectively, consistent with prior estimates. Finally, we measure Band 6-7 spectral indices of $2.5\pm1.2$ (PDS 70 c) and $3.2\pm0.5$ (inner disc), suggesting that the inner disc emission is dominated by optically thin dust.</description>

      <title>ALMA millimetre-wavelength imaging of HD 138965: New constraints on the debris dust composition and presence of planetary companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 138965 is a young A type star and member of the nearby young Argus association. This star is surrounded by a broad, bright debris disc with two temperature components that was spatially resolved at far-infrared wavelengths by Herschel. Here we present ALMA millimetre-wavelength imaging of the cool outer belt. These reveal its radial extent to be $150^{+10}_{-7}$ au with a width ($\sigma$) of 49$^{+7}_{-6}$ au (${\Delta}R/R$ = 0.77), at a moderate inclination of 49$\fdeg$9^{+3.3}_{-3.7}$. Due to the limited angular resolution, signal-to-noise, and inclination we have no constraint on the disc's vertical scale height. We modelled the disc emission with both gravitational and radiation forces acting on the dust grains. As the inner belt has not been spatially resolved, we fixed its radius and width prior to modelling the outer belt. We find astronomical silicate is the best fit for the dust composition. However, we could not reject possible scenarios where there are at least 10 \% water-ice inclusions. Combining the spatially resolved imaging by ALMA with non-detection at optical wavelengths by HST, we obtain a limit on the scattering albedo $\omega \leq 0.09$ for the debris dust in the outer belt. Analysis of the outer belt's architecture in conjunction with simple stirring models places a mass limit of $2.3~\pm~0.4 M_{\rm Jup}$ on a companion interior to the belt ($a \leq 78$ au), a factor of two improvement over constraints from high contrast imaging.</description>

      <title>JWST spectroscopy of a blue binary cold classical Kuiper belt object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of two binary systems within the cold classical region of the Kuiper belt -- 2001 XR254 and 2016 BP81 -- obtained with the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The measured reflectance spectrum of 2001 XR254 is characteristic of the red cold classicals, with strong features due to carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol ices. In contrast, 2016 BP81 is a blue binary, with a water-ice-rich surface composition. The two components of the 2016 BP81 binary display identical spectral profiles, consistent with coeval formation from gravitational collapse. Through qualitative and quantitative comparisons of water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects observed with JWST, we identify a small subclass, including 2016 BP81, that appears to differ in systematic ways from the rest of the population. The relatively deep carbon dioxide ice absorption bands and enhanced signatures of aliphatic organics suggest that objects within this subclass may have originated in a distinct formation environment from the other water-ice-rich Kuiper belt objects. The implications of our findings are discussed within the context of recent models of Kuiper belt formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Spot-Crossing Variations Confirm a Misaligned Orbit for a Planet Transiting an M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-3884~b is an unusual 6.4~R$_\oplus$ planet orbiting an M4 host, whose transits display large and persistent spot-crossing events. We used the \textit{Tierras} Observatory to monitor both the long-term photometric variability of TOI-3884 and changes in the spot-crossing events across multiple transits of the planet. We show that the star rotates with a period of $11.021 \pm 0.014$~days. We simultaneously model the rotational modulation of the star and variations in transit shapes that arise due to rotation of the spot, allowing us to determine the true stellar obliquity, $\psi_\star$. The data are best described by a planet on a misaligned orbit around a highly inclined star ($\psi_\star = {76.1^\circ} ^{+2.2^\circ}_{-2.6^\circ}$; $i_\star = {24.4^\circ}^{+1.8^\circ}_{-1.4^\circ}$) that hosts a large polar starspot ($r_\mathrm{spot} = {33.1^\circ}^{+2.0^\circ}_{-1.9^\circ}$; $\lambda_\mathrm{spot} = {79.4^\circ}^{+1.4^\circ}_{-1.2^\circ}$). Archival photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility suggests that this polar spot has persisted on TOI-3884 for at least seven years. The TOI-3884 system provides a benchmark for studying the evolution of a polar spot on an M dwarf.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Driven by Magnetic Pressure Generated through Stellar Magnetosphere-Disk Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of jets in young stellar objects (YSOs) remains a subject of active investigation. We present a 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the circumstellar disk. At the beginning of the simulation, the magnetosphere partially opens, forming two oppositely directed magnetic field regions: one threading the star and the other threading the inner disk. The latter dominates over the original disk field at small radii and contributes to launching a disk wind. In our model, the jet is launched from the interface between these regions by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along ``two-legged'' field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the disk surface. Outflows are driven along these lines via a ``load-fire-reload'' cycle: in the ``load'' stage, differential rotation between the stellar and disk footpoints generates a toroidal magnetic field; in the ``fire'' stage, vertical gradients in toroidal field strength drive the outflow and release magnetic energy; and in the ``reload'' stage, magnetic reconnection between oppositely directed field lines resets the configuration, enabling the cycle to repeat. This process occurs rapidly and asynchronously across azimuthal angles, producing a continuous, large-scale outflow. From an energetic perspective, Poynting flux transports the toroidal field from the vicinity of the star into the polar cavity, powering the jet. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic field geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.</description>

      <title>A Next-Generation Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrieval Framework for Transmission Spectroscopy (NEXOTRANS): Comparative Characterization for WASP-39 b Using JWST NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of JWST has marked a new era in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, offering higher-resolution data and greater precision across a broader spectral range than previous space-based telescopes. Accurate analysis of these datasets requires advanced retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces. We present NEXOTRANS, an atmospheric retrieval framework that integrates Bayesian inference using UltraNest/PyMultiNest with four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Stacking Regressor. This hybrid approach enables a comparison between traditional Bayesian methods and computationally efficient machine learning techniques. Additionally, NEXOTRANS incorporates NEXOCHEM, a module for solving equilibrium chemistry. We applied NEXOTRANS to JWST observations of the Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39 b, spanning wavelengths from 0.6 microns to 12.0 microns using NIRISS, NIRSpec PRISM, and MIRI. Four chemistry models - free, equilibrium, modified hybrid equilibrium, and modified equilibrium-offset chemistry - were explored to retrieve precise Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs) for H2O, CO2, CO, H2S, and SO2. Absorption features in both NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI data constrained SO2 log VMRs to values between -6.25 and -5.73 for all models except equilibrium chemistry. High-altitude aerosols, including ZnS and MgSiO3, were inferred, with constraints on their VMRs, particle sizes, and terminator coverage fractions, providing insights into cloud composition. For the best-fit modified hybrid equilibrium model, we derived super-solar elemental abundances of O/H = 14.12 (+2.86/-1.82) x solar, C/H = 21.37 (+4.93/-3.18) x solar, and S/H = 5.37 (+0.79/-0.65) x solar, along with a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.05/-0.02) x solar, demonstrating NEXOTRANS's potential for atmospheric characterization in the JWST era and beyond.</description>

      <title>Eastward Transients in the Dayside Ionosphere II: A Parallel-plate Capacitor-Like Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the 23 April 2023 geospace storm, we observed chorus wave-driven, energetic particle precipitation on closed magnetic field lines in the dayside magnetosphere. Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'. We propose that transient eastward electrodynamic bursts in the dayside ionosphere might be a common, albeit previously unresolved, feature of geomagnetic storms.</description>

Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs) showing transits from orbiting planetary debris provide significant insights into the structure and dynamics of debris disks. This is a rare class of objects with only eight published systems. In this work, we perform a systematic search for such systems within 500 pc in the Gaia-eDR3 catalog of WDs using the light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and present six new candidates. Our selection process targets the top 1% most photometrically variable sources identified using a combined variability metric from ZTF and Gaia eDR3 photometry, boosted by a metric space we define using von Neumann statistics and Pearson-Skew as a novel discovery tool to identify these systems. This is followed by optical spectroscopic observations of visually selected variables to confirm metal pollution. Four of the six systems show long-timescale photometric variability spanning several months to years, resulting either from long-term evolution of transit activity or dust and debris clouds at wide orbits. Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of reddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction makes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius $\lesssim$$0.3~{\rm \mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also shows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk orbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the abundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show that transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates compared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of these systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near future. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very long-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.</description>

      <title>First Detections of PN, PO, and PO+ toward a Shocked Low-mass Starless Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17849</link>

Abstract: Phosphorus is a key element that plays an essential role in biological processes important for living organisms on Earth. The origin and connection of phosphorus-bearing molecules to early Solar system objects and star-forming molecular clouds is therefore of great interest, yet there are limited observations throughout different stages of low-mass ($M &lt; $ a few M$_\odot$) star formation. Observations from the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes detect for the first time in the 7mm, 3mm, and 2mm bands multiple transitions of PN and PO, as well as a single transition of PO$^{+}$, toward a low-mass starless core. The presence of PN, PO and PO$^{+}$ is kinematically correlated with bright SiO(1-0) emission. Our results reveal not only that shocks are the main driver of releasing phosphorus from dust grains and into the gas-phase, but that the emission originates from gas not affiliated with the shock itself, but quiescent gas that has been shocked in the recent past. From radiative transfer calculations, the PO/PN abundance ratio is found to be $3.1^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$, consistent with other high-mass and low-mass star-forming regions. This first detection of PO$^{+}$ toward any low-mass star-forming region reveals a PO$^{+}$/PO ratio of $0.0115^{+0.0008}_{-0.0009}$, a factor of ten lower than previously determined from observations of a Galactic Center molecular cloud, suggesting its formation can occur under more standard Galactic cosmic-ray ionization rates. These results motivate the need for additional observations that can better disentangle the physical mechanisms and chemical drivers of this precursor of prebiotic chemistry.</description>
