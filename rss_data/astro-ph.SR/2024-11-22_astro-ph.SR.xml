      <title>The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) I.: High precision stellar chemical abundance for 17 planet-hosting stars and the condensation temperature trend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]$_{\rm solar}$ - [X/Fe]$_{\rm star}$) versus condensation temperature ($T_c$) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative $T_c$ trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant-planet-host stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between $T_c$ trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Studies on the Evolution of Solar Filaments in Response to New Emerging Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New emerging flux (NEF) has long been considered a mechanism for solar eruptions, but detailed process remains an open question. In this work, we explore how NEF drives a coronal magnetic configuration to erupt. This configuration is created by two magnetic sources of strengths $M$ and $S$ embedded in the photosphere, one electric-current-carrying flux rope (FR) floating in the corona, and an electric current induced on the photospheric surface by the FR. The source $M$ is fixed accounting for the initial background field, and $S$ changes playing the role of NEF. We introduce the channel function $C$ to forecast the overall evolutionary behavior of the configuration. Location, polarity, and strength of NEF governs the evolutionary behavior of FR before eruption. In the case of $|S/M|&lt;1$ with reconnection occur between new and old fields, the configuration in equilibrium evolves to the critical state, invoking the catastrophe. In this case, if polarities of the new and old fields are opposite, reconnection occurs as NEF is close to FR; and if polarities are the same, reconnection happens as NEF appears far from FR. With different combinations of the relative polarity and the location, the evolutionary behavior of the system gets complex, and the catastrophe may not occur. If $|S/M|&gt;1$ and the two fields have opposite polarity, the catastrophe always takes place; but if the polarities are the same, catastrophe occurs only as NEF is located far from FR; otherwise, the evolution ends up either with failed eruption or without catastrophe at all.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear internal waves breaking in stellar radiation zones. Parametrisation for the transport of angular momentum: bridging geophysical to stellar fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can play a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along their evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since space-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars, which is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar models ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular momentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they meet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been derived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their radiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along their propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered by their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and robust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and evolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been developed for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and has been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to the case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the modification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which are discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete semi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs, which takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential nonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear instabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the interactions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of realism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>First Calculations of Starspot Spectra based on 3D Radiative Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of starspot spectra are essential for multiple applications in astronomy. The current standard is to represent starspot spectra by spectra of stars that are cooler than the quiet star regions. This implies approximating a starspot as a non-magnetic 1D structure in radiative-convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions. Here, we take a different approach avoiding the approximate treatment of convection and instead self-consistently accounting for the interaction between matter, radiation, and the magnetic field. We simulate spots on G2V, K0V, M0V stars with the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics code MURaM and calculate spectra ($R \approx 500$ from 250~nm to 6000~nm) using ray-by-ray radiative transfer with the MPS-ATLAS code. We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights rendering mixing length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50\% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars, and less than 2\% (for umbrae) and 10\% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity X. Physical Parameters and Feedback of Massive Stars in the LMC N11 B Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars lead the ionization and mechanical feedback within young star-forming regions. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for studying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution to the environment. We analyze eight exemplary targets in LMC N11 B from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) program, using novel spectra from HST (COS and STIS) in the UV, and from VLT (X-shooter) in the optical. We model the spectra of early to late O-type stars by using state-of-the-art PoWR atmosphere models. We determine the stellar and wind parameters (e.g., $T_\star$, $\log g$, $L_{\star}$, $\dot{M}$, $v_\infty$) of the analyzed objects, chemical abundances (C, N, O), ionizing and mechanical feedback ($Q_\mathrm{H}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$, $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$, $L_\mathrm{mec}$) and X-rays. We report ages of $2-4.5$ Myr and masses of $30-60$ $M_\odot$ for the analyzed stars in N11 B, consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation. We note that the observed wind-momentum luminosity relation is consistent with theoretical predictions. We detect nitrogen enrichment in most of the stars, up to a factor of seven. However, we do not find a correlation between nitrogen enrichment and projected rotational velocity. Finally, based on their spectral type, we estimate the total ionizing photons injected from the O-type stars in N11 B into its environment. We report $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{H}$)$=50.5$ ph s$^{-1}$, $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{I}}}$)$=49.6$ ph s$^{-1}$ and $\log$ ($\sum$ $Q_\mathrm{He{\small{II}}}$)$=44.4$ ph s$^{-1}$, consistent with the total ionizing budget in N11.</description>

      <title>The Sun at millimeter wavelengths V. Magnetohydrodynamic waves in a fibrillar structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, playing a crucial role in transporting energy through the solar atmosphere, manifest in various chromospheric structures. Here, we investigated MHD waves in a long-lasting dark fibril using high-temporal-resolution (2~s cadence) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in Band 6 (centered at 1.25~mm). We detected oscillations in brightness temperature, horizontal displacement, and width at multiple locations along the fibril, with median periods and standard deviations of $240\pm114$~s, $225\pm102$~s, and $272\pm118$~s, respectively. Wavelet analysis revealed a combination of standing and propagating waves, suggesting the presence of both MHD kink and sausage modes. Less dominant than standing waves, oppositely propagating waves exhibit phase speeds (median and standard deviation of distributions) of $74\pm204$~km/s, $52\pm197$~km/s, and $28\pm254$~km/s for the three observables, respectively. This work demonstrates ALMA's capability to effectively sample dynamic fibrillar structures, despite previous doubts, and provides valuable insights into wave dynamics in the upper chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the BE99 method for the study of outflowing gas in protostellar jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An established method measuring the hydrogen ionisation fraction in shock excited gas is the BE99 method, which utilises six bright forbidden emission lines of [SII]6716, 6731, [NII]6548, 6583, and [OI]6300, 6363. We aim to extent the BE99 method by including more emission lines in the blue and near-infrared part of the spectrum ($\lambda$ = 3500-11000A), and considering higher hydrogen ionisation fractions ($x_e &gt; 0.3$). In addition, we investigate how a non-equilibrium state of the gas and the presence of extinction influence the BE99 technique. We find that plenty additional emission line ratios can in principle be exploited as extended curves (or stripes) in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. If the BE99 equilibrium is reached and extinction is corrected for, all stripes overlap in one location in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram indicating the existing gas parameters. The application to the Par Lup 3-4 outflow shows that the classical BE99 lines together with the [NI]5198+5200 lines do not meet in one locationin the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. This indicates that the gas parameters derived from the classical BE99 method are not fully consistent with other observed line ratios. A multi-line approach is necessary to determine the gas parameters. From our analysis we derive $n_e \sim$ 45 000 cm^-3 - 53000 cm^-3 , $T_e$ = 7600K - 8000K, and $x_e \sim$ 0.027 - 0.036 for the Par Lup 3-4 outflow. For the 244-440 Proplyd we were able to use the line ratios of [SII]6716+6731, [OI]6300+6363, and [OII]7320, 7330 in the BE99 diagram to estimate the ionisation fraction at knot E3 ($x_e = 0.58 \pm 0.05$). In conclusion, exploiting new line ratios reveals more insights on the state of the gas. Our analysis indicates, however, that a multi-line approach is more robust in deriving gas parameters, especially for high density gas.</description>

      <title>Y Gem, a Symbiotic Star Outshined by its Asymptotic Giant Branch Primary Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission indicative of the presence of a binary companion. AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine their companions, making almost impossible their identification. Y Gem has been known to be a far-UV- and X-ray-bright AGB star for some decades now, but the nature of its companion, whether it is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system (SySt), is disputed. Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem to help us peer into the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multi-wavelength IR, optical, UV and X-ray observations have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an optical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray data are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion disk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow recombination and forbidden emission lines. The presence of the emission lines and the analysis of the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\odot}$, very likely an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1 M$_\odot$ AGB star with $T_\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\odot$. Using IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is a S-type SySt whose compact component is accreting at an estimated mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}=2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At such accretion rate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase where no recurrent events are expected.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Type-I Solar Noise Storms from High Angular Resolution Spectroscopic Imaging with the Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-I solar noise storms are perhaps the most commonly observed active radio emissions from the Sun at meter-wavelengths. Noise storms have a long-lived and wideband continuum background with superposed islands of much brighter narrowband and short-lived emissions, known as type-I bursts. There is a serious paucity of studies focusing on the morphology of these two types of emissions, primarily because of the belief that coronal scattering will always wash out any features at small angular scales. However, it is important to investigate their spatial structures in detail to make a spatio-temporal connection with observations at extreme-ultraviolet/ X-ray bands to understand the detailed nature of these emissions. In this work, we use high angular resolution observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to demonstrate that it is possible to detect structures with angular scales as small as $\sim 9\arcsec$, about three times smaller than the smallest structure reported to date from noise storms. Our observations also suggest while the individual type-I bursts are narrowband in nature, the bursts are probably caused by traveling disturbance(s) inducing magnetic reconnections at different coronal heights, and thus leading to correlated change in the morphology of the type-I bursts observed at a wide range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Classification of Wolf Rayet stars using Ensemble-based Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a robust Machine Learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars based on Infrared (IR) colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive dataset of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86\% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models such as the Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR sub-type classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy ($&gt;60\%$). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting sub-types for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the Local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1806.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on previous results on the quadratic helicity in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) we investigate particular minimum helicity states. Those are eigenfunctions of the curl operator and are shown to constitute solutions of the quasi-stationary incompressible ideal MHD equations. We then show that these states have indeed minimum quadratic helicity.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The magnetic field in quiescent star-forming filament G16.96+0.27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4"(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.</description>

      <title>Streams and Bubbles: Tidal Shaping of Planetary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planets lose mass to atmospheric outflows, and this mass loss is thought to be central in shaping the bimodal population of gaseous giant and rocky terrestrial exoplanets in close orbits. We model the escape of planetary atmospheres in three dimensional gas dynamic simulations in order to study their emergent morphology. Planetary outflows show a range of shapes from fast, isotropic outflows bounded by bow shocks to slower motion confined to thin streams. We show that a crucial factor is the role of the tidal gravity and orbiting reference frame in which planets lose mass. Flows can be characterized by the dimensionless Rossby number evaluated at the scale of the Hill sphere. Flows with a low Rossby number are significantly deviated and shaped by the stellar gravity, while those with a high Rossby number are comparatively unaffected. Rossby number alone is sufficient to predict outflow morphology as well as kinematic gradients across transit. The known exoplanet population should span a range of outflow Rossby numbers and thus shapes. We can use this information to constrain outflow physics and to inform observing strategies.</description>
