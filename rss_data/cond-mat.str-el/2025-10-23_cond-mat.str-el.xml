      <title>Haerter-Shastry kinetic magnetism and metallicity in the triangular Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fermionic Hubbard model, when combined with the ingredient of frustration, associated with the breaking of particle-hole symmetry, harbors a rich phase diagram. Aspects of theoretical findings associated with the nature of magnetism and metallicity, in a diverse set of parameter regimes, are now being actively investigated in triangular Hubbard cold atom and solid-state (moir\'e) based emulators. Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and Shastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of kinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order emerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density. We numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of stability of the kinetically induced $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to hole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations (metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss the implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and investigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete.</description>

      <title>Ferro-spinetic Altermagnets from Electronic Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are fully compensated collinear antiferromagnets that lack the combined time-reversal and translation symmetry. Here we show that their symmetry allows for a switchable ferro-spinetic polarization - the spin analogue of ferroelectricity - in a direction dictated by the lattice symmetry. We demonstrate this effect first in its purest form in an interacting altermagnetic fermion model, in which a many-body chiral symmetry forbids any charge polarization. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal edge-localized, reversible spin accumulations fully consistent with this symmetry locking. Breaking the chiral symmetry releases the charge sector: a ferroelectric polarization emerges orthogonal to the ferro-spinetic one, yielding mutually perpendicular switchable spin- and charge-polarized responses. We identify Mn-based metal-organic frameworks as realistic hosts for this effect, offering a practical route for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity from altermagnetic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) fluctuations are a new class of collinear spin fluctuations whose role in mediating superconductivity faces a fundamental tension: their $\Gamma$-point peak favors intra-orbital spin-triplet pairing, while their spin compensation favors inter-orbital singlets. Here, we demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The resulting $\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\tau_z$-type order parameter, $c_{k,1\uparrow}c_{-k,1\uparrow} - c_{k,2\uparrow}c_{-k,2\uparrow}$. Although intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines a general \textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is distinct from the $\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a Josephson junction between them.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Perturbation Theory for Driven Dissipative Quasiparticle Flows and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified many-body perturbation theory for open quantum systems, that treats dissipation, correlations, and external driving on equal footing. Using a Keldysh-Lindblad formalism, we introduce diagrammatic treatment of dissipative interaction lines representing quasiparticle flows and fluctuations. Two new Feynman rules render the evaluation of dissipative diagrams compact and systematically improvable, while preserving the Keldysh and anti-Hermitian symmetries of the closed-system theory. Consequently, the structure of the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE) remains unchanged, enabling existing numerical methods to be directly applied. To illustrate this, we derive dissipative versions of the second Born and GW approximations, identifying the physical content of the self-energy components. Moreover, we demonstrate that time-linear approximations to the full KBE retain their closed structure and can be efficiently used to simulate relaxation and decoherence dynamics. This framework establishes a general route toward first-principles modeling of correlated, driven, and dissipative quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Calculating the Luttinger liquid parameter for an interacting Kitaev chain quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a solid-state platform for building quantum simulators using implanted spin centers in solid-state materials. We build upon the proposal for an $S=1$ chain of spin centers coupled through the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction and subjected to an external magnetic field as a quantum simulator for critical floating phases. We introduce another magnetic field and map the system to the interacting Kitaev chain. This setup, tunable through the applied fields and the orientation of the spin centers within the crystal, exhibits a variety of rich quantum behavior which notably includes floating phases, a $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking phase, and lines of both Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions. Furthermore, we employ several novel methods to calculate the Luttinger liquid parameter in our model with incommensurate correlations. We find that these methods provide a route to identify BKT transitions with less computational resources than utilizing entanglement entropy and central charge.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic collapse of electronic correlations in the ferromagnet UGe$_2$ under high magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present electrical-resistivity measurements on the prototypical heavy-fermion ferromagnet UGe$_2$ under pulsed magnetic field up to 60~T. An anisotropic field-induced suppression of the electronic correlations is revealed. The electrical resistivity strongly decreases when a magnetic field $\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the easy magnetic axis $\mathbf{a}$, while it remains almost unchanged when $\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the hard magnetic axes $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$. The field-induced destabilization of the ferromagnetic state is also anisotropic: the anomaly at the Curie temperature $T_C$ disappears in fields higher than $\gtrsim1$~T for $\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and in fields higher than $\gtrsim20$~T for $\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$. At temperatures below 2~K, we observe quantum oscillations in fields larger than 50~T applied along $\mathbf{b}$, which support the presence of a two-dimensional Fermi surface similar to that previously observed at low fields.</description>

      <title>Pairing Symmetry Crossover from $d$-wave to $s_{\pm}$-wave in a Bilayer Nickelate Driven by Hund's Coupling and Crystal Field Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a subject of intense debate in condensed matter physics, with the two leading theoretical candidates being a sign-reversing $s_{\pm}$-wave and a $d$-wave state. To investigate its ground-state properties in the intermediate coupling regime which is critical for real materials, we construct a two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model and employ the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method for large-scale simulations. By systematically calculating ground-state pairing correlation functions across parameter spaces, we map its pairing symmetry phase diagram. We find that an increasing Hund's coupling selectively enhances the interlayer $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing while suppressing the intralayer $d$-wave pairing. Similarly, a larger crystal field splitting drives a transition from $d$-wave- to $s_{\pm}$-wave-dominant states. Further analysis reveals that the strength of the intralayer $d$-wave pairing is strongly correlated with the $(\pi, \pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are in turn effectively suppressed by a large crystal field splitting, thereby weakening the $d$-wave pairing channel. Additionally, the dominant pairing symmetry transition region roughly overlaps with the inversion of orbital occupancy response to Hubbard $U$, suggesting an intrinsic link between pairing competition and orbital physics. Our results indicate that, within the parameter regime relevant to the actual material, the $s_{\pm}$-wave is the most probable pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Discrete Shift and Polarization from Response to Symmetry Defects in Interacting Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected topological invariants to the correlated regime. We construct the interacting Hofstadter model defined on square lattice with the rotation and translation symmetry defects: disclination and dislocation. The model realizes Chern insulator and the charge density wave state as one tunes interactions. Employing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we calculate the excess charge around the defects and find that the topological invariants remain quantized in both phases, with the topological quantity extracted to great precision. This study paves the way for utilizing matrix product state, and potentially other quantum many-body computation methods, to efficiently study crystalline symmetry defects on 2D interacting lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Practical algorithm for simulating thermal pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of novel quantum many-body computational algorithms relies on robust benchmarking. However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by the massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or quantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states, which allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the $4 \times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster than $\mathcal{H}\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is extended down to $\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels. These advances significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Applied electric and magnetic field effects on the bandgap formation and antiferromagnetic ordering in AA-stacked Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a two-layer graphene structure stacked in the AA form and exposed to the influence of two different electric fields applied to different layers. The graphene layers are also subjected to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the planes of the layers. We investigate the possible effects of the applied in-plane fields and the magnetic field on excitonic pairing, antiferromagnetic order, and the chemical potential. Simultaneously, we analyze the effects of the interlayer Coulomb interaction potential on the physical properties of the considered system. We demonstrate that the application of planar electric fields leads to the formation of an unusually large bandgap in the electronic band structure, which is not typical for AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We discuss various values of the applied electric field potentials and show their influence on the electronic band structure of the system. Additionally, we identify the existence of a critical value of the magnetic field above which Wigner crystallization-like effect is present for the electrons, also affecting the excitonic gap in one spin channel. The results obtained in this study could be important for applications of AA-stacked bilayer graphene as a large band-gap material.</description>

      <title>Temperature-invariant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effect have traditionally been associated with ferromagnets, but recent studies reveal their presence in noncollinear antiferromagnets due to nonzero Berry curvature despite negligible net magnetization. However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis, and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength, demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the N\'eel temperature. This temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets, facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Krylov space dynamics of ergodic and dynamically frozen Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In isolated quantum many-body systems periodically driven in time, the asymptotic dynamics at late times can exhibit distinct behavior such as thermalization or dynamical freezing. Understanding the properties of and the convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate diagnostic of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson causality and non-Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical lattice models with local, bounded interactions obey Lieb-Robinson causality. We show that this implies a domain of analyticity of the retarded Green's function $G^R(\omega,{\bf k})$ of local lattice operators as a function of complex frequency $\omega$ and momentum ${\bf k}$, similar to the lightcone analyticity property of relativistic field theories. Low-energy effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the `Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude $|G^R(\omega,{\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids.</description>

      <title>Magnon scattering and transduction in Coulomb-coupled quantum Hall ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetization field of a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHFM) can host a variety of spin textures, including skyrmions and magnons. When projected into the lowest Landau level with $\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin) charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for future experiments in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of electronic and topological properties of low-dimensional tellurium</title>

Abstract: We employ first-principles density-functional theory to investigate the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, and topological properties of tellurium in its various dimensional forms: bulk trigonal tellurium (Te-I), two-dimensional (2D) monolayers $\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te and one-dimensional helical nanowire (Te-h). A softening of the acoustic phonon modes is seen in most of the 2D phases, suggesting a tendency to structural distortions or phase transitions under small perturbations. The trigonal 3D Te-I structure is characterized as a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes at high-symmetry locations in the Brillouin zone, which is supported by the characteristic spin texture seen in momentum space, where spins align radially, forming Berry monopoles. This topological feature, along with the observation of Weyl phonons is attributed to inversion symmetry breaking and strong SOC. Ultrathin Te-h nanowires also exhibit signatures of Weyl nodes and presents a considerable energy gap under SOC. On the other hand, the two-dimensional monolayers $\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te, are classified as topologically trivial, as indicated by their topological invariants, which arises from the preservation of both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries in these systems. The potential for inducing topological phase transitions via external perturbations suggest that these monolayers are promising candidates for engineered Weyl phases or other topological states. We demonstrate that tellurium and its low-dimensional derivatives are versatile materials that exhibit a broad range of electronic and phononic phenomena intrinsically linked to chirality and symmetry breaking. The tunability of their electronic and topological properties places tellurium as a promising material platform for the exploration and application of Weyl physics in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Eigensolver with Real-Space Sampling and Symmetric Subspace Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\!-\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The Superconducting Transition due to the spontaneous Interlayer Loop Current fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</description>

      <title>Fock space fragmentation in quenches of disordered interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation, as it is currently investigated, primarily originates from specific kinematic constraints or emergent conservation laws in many-body systems with translation invariance. It leads to non-ergodic dynamics and possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random on-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh perspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we split the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the accessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this construction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry, e.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder regime, $W&lt;W_c$, represent fluctuations of the mass of the shell. Upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder, $W&gt;W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays into fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a strong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with increasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation dynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation of Fock-space fragmentation introduced here.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity of semi-metallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of $164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of graphite.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of gate-tunable flat bands in twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle, displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement field.</description>

      <title>Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy of layered superconductors with device-integrated diamond anvil cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors that can be mechanically exfoliated are an interesting platform for exploring superconducting properties tuned by layer thickness. These layered superconductors are also expected to exhibit sensitivity to applied pressure. While pressure has been demonstrated to be an effective way of tuning bulk superconductors, analogous studies on superconducting thin flakes have been limited due to technical challenges. In particular, spectroscopic measurements under pressure remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we functionalized the diamond anvil cell technique for point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) measurement on thin-flake materials under pressure, offering the opportunity to obtain spectroscopic information on superconductivity. To validate the feasibility of this method, we have conducted PCAR measurements on iron-selenide thin flakes to extract temperature-dependent superconducting gap values under ambient and high pressure. Combine with the proven magnetotransport capability, our method provides a conceptually simple tool for a detailed examination of thin-flake superconductors under pressure.</description>

      <title>Extracting transport coefficients from local ground-state currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties are central to characterizing quantum matter, yet their extraction typically requires external forcing and time-resolved measurements. In this work, we propose a scheme to access transport coefficients directly from measurements of local, static ground-state currents -- quantities readily accessible in quantum-engineered platforms. By exploiting the exponential decay of correlations in gapped systems and the finite velocity of correlation spreading, we demonstrate that the local Hall response can be reconstructed from a small set of quasi-local current observables. We derive explicit relations connecting these static observables to a practical local Chern marker, and introduce a scalable digital protocol for measuring the required generalized currents in cold-atom quantum simulators. Numerical simulations of a non-interacting Chern insulator validate our approach. Moreover, the scheme extends naturally to fractional Chern insulators and other strongly correlated systems, even at finite temperature, offering a broadly applicable route to probing transport in engineered quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Soft Mode Origin of Charge Ordering in Superconducting Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that, for any $d$, any state with $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces, each of which forms an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, while there exist rare eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterising the transition and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed ''deep boundary criticality''. Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

Abstract: One of the challenges in diagrammatic simulations of nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice models is the large memory demand for storing momentum-dependent two-time correlation functions. This problem can be overcome with the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) representation of multivariable functions. Here, we demonstrate nonequilibrium Green's function simulations within the $GW$ and Migdal approximations with high momentum resolution, up to times which exceed the capabilities of standard implementations and are long enough to study, e.g., transient Floquet physics during multi-cycle electric field pulses and thermalization dynamics. The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour is fully self-contained, employing only QTT-compressed functions and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17432v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many microscopic models with the interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter for cuprate physics have inspired us to study the diagonal superexchange interaction in a CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated phenomena occur in quantum materials because of the delicate interplay between internal degrees of freedom, leading to multiple symmetry-broken quantum phases. Resolving the structure of these phases is a key challenge, often requiring facilities equipped with x-ray free-electron lasers and electron sources that may not be readily accessible to the average user. Table-top sources that offer alternative means are therefore needed. In this work, we present an all-optical, table-top setup that enables symmetry-resolved studies using linear and nonlinear spectroscopies. We demonstrate the versatility of the setup with chosen examples that underscore the importance of tracking symmetries and showcase the strengths of the setup, which offers a large tunable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations of charge density wave order across the transition in 2H-NbSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) involve coupled amplitude and phase degrees of freedom, but direct access to local amplitude correlations remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report cryogenic four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) measurements of CDW ordering in a 2H-NbSe2 flake of 24 nm thickness, enabled by liquid helium-based cooling. By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that a finite local CDW amplitude is already established well above the transition temperature. When the system is cooled below the transition temperature down to 20 K, the correlation length extends to nearly 110 nm, and the local CDW amplitude is found to strongly anticorrelate with the local strain field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin chains with competing interactions offer a platform where low dimensionality and frustration--both acting to suppress magnetic order--intersect. We studied magnetic ordering in the spin-1/2 chain compound AgCuVO$_4$ using muon spin spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Long-range magnetic order emerges at $T_N = 2.0(1)$ K, which is $\sim$1/200 of the dominant intrachain coupling $J$ and $\sim$1/15 of the interchain interactions. The collinear incommensurate amplitude-modulated magnetic structure features a reduced ordered moment of 0.13(3) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, confined to the $ab$ plane and modulated along the $c$ axis--perpendicular to the spin chains--indicating frustrated interchain couplings. The low $T_N$, small moment, and incommensurate order highlight strong frustration, positioning AgCuVO$_4$ as a model system for exploring frustration in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Closely competing valence bond crystal orders in the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice: a large scale unrestricted variational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, the nature of its ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH from the resonating valence bond(RVB) theory perspective. We find a candidate ground state of the system that features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\vec{a}_{1}\times2\vec{a}_{2}\times2\vec{a}_{3}$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. Intriguingly, we find that within the RVB framework such a maximally resonating VBC state is almost degenerate with a recently proposed VBC state that is obtained from dressing hard hexagon covering of the pyrochlore lattice, although they have very different structures. We also find that further symmetry breaking will occur in the dressed hard hexagon VBC state under unrestricted optimization, which results in strong disparity in $\langle \hat{\mathbf{S}}^{2}_{u} \rangle$ for up and down tetrahedrons as we observe in the maximally resonating VBC state. We show that the maximally resonating VBC state found here will be favored by a tiny next-neighboring exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moir\'e Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to hexagonal boron nitride aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We show that incorporating RPA correlation energy and $GW$ self-energy corrections yields phase diagrams and single-particle spectra that quantitatively align with experimental measurements. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems has attracted increasing attention owing to a variety of intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging and control of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnetic single-crystal thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the N\'eel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Emergent Kitaev materials in synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of bond-directional spin-spin interactions in a synthetic Fermi-Hubbard bilayer that can be realized with ultracold fermions in Raman optical lattices. The model exploits synthetic dimensions to couple two honeycomb layers, each corresponding to a different hyperfine atomic state, via Raman-assisted tunneling and, moreover, via an inter-layer Hubbard repulsion due to the cold-atom scattering. In the strong-coupling regime at half filling, we derive effective spin Hamiltonians for the kinetic exchange featuring Kitaev, Heisenberg, off-diagonal exchange ($\Gamma$-couplings), as well as tunable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. We identify specific configurations that generate both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev couplings with various perturbations of relevance to Kitaev materials, providing a tunable platform that can explore how quantum spin liquids emerge from itinerant fermion systems. We analyze the Fermi-liquid and Mott-insulating phases, highlighting a correspondence between Dirac and Majorana quasi-particles, with possible phase transitions thereof. In an extreme anisotropic limit, we show that the model reduces to an inter-layer ribbon in a quasi-1D ladder, allowing for a numerical study of the correlated ground state using matrix product states. We find a transition from a symmetry-protected topological insulator to a Kitaev-like regime characterized by nonlocal string order. Our results establish that cold-atom quantum simulators based on Raman optical lattices can be a playground for extended Kitaev models, bridging itinerant fermionic systems and spin-liquid physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

      <title>Interplay of competing bond-order and loop-current fluctuations as a possible mechanism for superconductivity in kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current (charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.</description>

Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>
