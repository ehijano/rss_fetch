      <title>AI-based data assimilation: Learning the functional of analysis estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of observational data into numerical models, known as data assimilation (DA), is fundamental for making Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) possible, with breathtaking success over the past 60 years (Bauer et al. 2015). Traditional DA methods, such as variational techniques and ensemble Kalman filters, are basic pillars of current NWP by incorporating diverse observational data. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for further improvements. AI-based approaches can emulate the complex computations of traditional NWP models at a reduced computational cost, offering the potential to speed up and improve analyses and forecasts dramatically (e.g. Pathak et al., 2022; Bi et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023; Bouallegue et al., 2023). AI itself plays a growing role in optimization (e.g. Fan et al., 2024), which offers new possibilities also beyond model emulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel AI-based variational DA approach designed to replace classical methods of DA by leveraging deep learning techniques. Unlike previous hybrid approaches, our method integrates the DA process directly into a neural network, utilizing the variational DA framework. This innovative AI-based system, termed AI-Var, employs a neural network trained to minimize the variational cost function, enabling it to perform DA without relying on pre-existing analysis datasets. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of this approach, demonstrating its feasibility through a series of idealized and real-world test cases. Our results indicate that the AI-Var system can efficiently assimilate observations and produce accurate initial conditions for NWP, highlighting its potential to carry out the DA process in weather forecasting. This advancement paves the way for fully data-driven NWP systems, offering a significant leap forward in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>AIFS - ECMWF's data-driven forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-based weather forecasting models have quickly emerged as a promising methodology for accurate medium-range global weather forecasting. Here, we introduce the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), a data driven forecast model developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS is based on a graph neural network (GNN) encoder and decoder, and a sliding window transformer processor, and is trained on ECMWF's ERA5 re-analysis and ECMWF's operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) analyses. It has a flexible and modular design and supports several levels of parallelism to enable training on high-resolution input data. AIFS forecast skill is assessed by comparing its forecasts to NWP analyses and direct observational data. We show that AIFS produces highly skilled forecasts for upper-air variables, surface weather parameters and tropical cyclone tracks. AIFS is run four times daily alongside ECMWF's physics-based NWP model and forecasts are available to the public under ECMWF's open data policy.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of hot synchronized planet--gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times--in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>

      <title>A detailed analysis of the origin of deep-decoupling oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variability of the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is influenced substantially by the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic. In many ocean models, so-called deep-decoupling oscillations have been found, whose timescale depends on the characteristics of convective vertical mixing processes. Their precise origin and sensitivity to the representation of mixing have remained unclear so far. To study this problem, we revisit a conceptual Welander model for the evolution of temperature and salinity in two vertically stacked boxes for surface and deep water, which interact through diffusion and/or convective adjustment. The model is known to exhibit several types of deep-decoupling oscillations, with phases of weak diffusive mixing interspersed with strong convective mixing, when the switching between them is assumed to be instantaneous. We present a comprehensive study of oscillations in Welander's model with non-instantaneous switching between mixing phases, as described by a smooth switching function. A dynamical systems approach allows us to distinguish four types of oscillations, in terms of their phases of diffusive versus convective mixing, and to identify the regions in the relevant parameter plane where they exist. The characteristic deep-decoupling oscillations still exist for non-instantaneous switching, but they require switching that is considerably faster than needed for sustaining oscillatory behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a gradual freshwater influx can lead to transitions between different vertical mixing oscillations. Notably, the convective mixing phase becomes shorter and even disappears, resulting in long periods of much reduced deep water formation. The results are relevant for the interpretation of ocean-climate variability in models and (proxy) observations.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum for sea state inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple method, based on an original change of variables, for the fast and accurate calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum that describes the sea echo of High-Frequency radars. A byproduct of the technique is the derivation of an improved weighting function which can be used for the inversion of the main sea state parameters. For this we revisit Barrick's method for the estimation of the significant wave height and the mean period from the ocean Doppler spectrum. On the basis of numerical simulations we show that a better estimation of these parameters can be reached but necessitates a preliminary bias correction that depends only on the radar frequency. A second consequence of our formulation is the derivation of a simple yet analytical nonlinear approximation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum when the Doppler frequency is larger than the Bragg frequency. This opens new perspective for the inversion of directional wave spectra from High-Frequency radar measurements.</description>
