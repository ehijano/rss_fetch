      <title>Design of a Turbo-based Deep Semantic Autoencoder for Marine Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the global marine economy and flourishing maritime activities, the marine Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining unprecedented momentum. However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission efficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep Semantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel coding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and receiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder and decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts messages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during neural network training according to channel characteristics and background knowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors. Specifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic vectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder employs Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic vectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is ensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the entire training process. Compared with traditional Turbo coding techniques, the Turbo-DSA shows a faster convergence speed, thanks to its efficient processing of semantic vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the Turbo-DSA surpasses existing benchmarks in key performance indicators, such as bilingual evaluation understudy scores and sentence similarity. This is particularly evident under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, where it shows superior text semantic transmission efficiency and adaptability to variable marine channel environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Distributed Hypothesis Testing in the Low-Power Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Stein-exponent of a distributed hypothesis testing scenario where two sensors transmit information through a memoryless multiple access channel (MAC) subject to a sublinear input cost constraint with respect to the number of channel uses and where the decision center has access to an additional local observation. Our main theorem provides conditions on the channel and cost functions for which the Stein-exponent of this distributed setup is no larger than the Stein-exponent of the local test at the decision center. Under these conditions, communication from the sensors to the decision center is thus useless in terms of Stein-exponent. The conditions are satisfied for additive noise MACs with generalized Gaussian noise under a p-th moment constraint (including the Gaussian channel with second-moment constraint) and for the class of fully-connected (where all inputs can induce all outputs) discrete memoryless multiple-access channels (DMMACs) under arbitrary cost constraints. We further show that for DMMACs that are not fully-connected, the Stein-exponent is larger and coincides with that of a setup with zero-rate noiseless communication links from either both sensors or only one sensor, as studied in [1].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, firstly, we study decoding of a general class of twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and provide a precise characterization of the key equation for TGRS codes and propose a decoding algorithm. Secondly, we further study decoding of almost-MDS TGRS codes and provide a decoding algorithm. These two decoding algorithms are more efficient in terms of performance compared with the decoding algorithms presented in [Sun et al., IEEE-TIT, 2024] and [Sui et al., IEEE-TIT, 2023] respectively.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Approach to MacWilliams Extension Property and Constant Weight Code with Respect to Weighted Hamming Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the MacWilliams extension property (MEP) and constant weight codes with respect to $\omega$-weight defined on $\mathbb{F}^{\Omega}$ via an elementary approach, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field, $\Omega$ is a finite set, and $\omega:\Omega\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is a weight function. Our approach relies solely on elementary linear algebra and two key identities for $\omega$-weight of subspaces derived from a double-counting argument. When $\omega$ is the constant $1$ map, our results recover two well-known results for Hamming metric code: (1) any Hamming weight preserving map between linear codes extends to a Hamming weight isometry of the entire ambient space; and (2) any constant weight Hamming metric code is a repetition of the dual of Hamming code.</description>

      <title>Fairness Designs for Load Balancing Optimization in Satellite-Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-ground communication systems are important in providing ubiquitous services in a large area. This paper considers the fairness designs under a load-balancing framework with heterogeneous receivers comprising access points (APs) and a satellite. We derive an ergodic throughput of each user in the uplink data transmission for an arbitrary association pattern and imperfect channel state information, followed by a closed-form expression with the maximum-ratio combining and rich scattering environments. We further formulate a generic fairness optimization problem, subject to the optimal association patterns for all the users. Despite the combinatorial structure, the global optimal solution to the association patterns can be obtained by an exhaustive search for small-scale networks with several APs and users. We design a low computational complexity algorithm for large-scale networks based on evolutionary computation that obtains good patterns in polynomial time. Specifically, the genetic algorithm (GA) is adapted to the discrete feasible region and the concrete fairness metrics. We extensively observe the fairness design problem by incorporating transmit power control and propose a hybrid genetic algorithm to address the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the association pattern to each user has a significant impact on the network throughput. Moreover, the proposed GA-based algorithm offers the same performance as an exhaustive search for small-scale networks, while it unveils interesting practical association patterns as the network dimensions go large. The load-balancing approach, combined with power control factors, significantly enhances system performance compared to conventional schemes and configurations with fixed factors.</description>

      <title>HyRES: A Hybrid Replication and Erasure Coding Approach to Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability in distributed storage systems has typically focused on the design and deployment of data replication or erasure coding techniques. Although some scenarios have considered the use of replication for hot data and erasure coding for cold data in the same system, each is designed in isolation. We propose HyRES, a hybrid scheme incorporates the best characteristics of each scheme, thus, resulting in additional design flexibility and better potential performance for the system. We show that HyRES generalizes previously proposed hybrid schemes. We characterize the theoretical performance of HyRES as well as that of replication and erasure coding considering the effects of the size of the storage networks. We validate our theoretical results using simulations. These results show that HyRES can yield simultaneously lower storage costs than replication, lower probabilities of file loss than replication and erasure coding with similar worst case performance, and even lower effective repair traffic than replication when considering the network size.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Conversion Bandwidth for MDS Convertible Codes in Split Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose several new lower bounds on the bandwidth costs of MDS convertible codes using a linear-algebraic framework. The derived bounds improve previous results in certain parameter regimes and match the bandwidth cost of the construction proposed by Maturana and Rashmi (2022 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory) for $r^F\le r^I\le k^F$, implying that our bounds are tight in this case.</description>

      <title>Secure Distributed RIS-MIMO over Double Scattering Channels: Adversarial Attack, Defense, and SER Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing trend toward leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to optimize and enhance the performance of wireless communication systems. However, limited attention has been given to the vulnerabilities of these techniques, particularly in the presence of adversarial attacks. This paper investigates the adversarial attack and defense in distributed multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems-based autoencoder in finite scattering environments. We present the channel propagation model for distributed multiple RIS, including statistical information driven in closed form for the aggregated channel. The symbol error rate (SER) is selected to evaluate the collaborative dynamics between the distributed RISs and MIMO communication in depth. The relationship between the number of RISs and the SER of the proposed system based on an autoencoder, as well as the impact of adversarial attacks on the system's SER, is analyzed in detail. We also propose a defense mechanism based on adversarial training against the considered attacks to enhance the model's robustness. Numerical results indicate that increasing the number of RISs effectively reduces the system's SER but leads to the adversarial attack-based algorithm becoming more destructive in the white-box attack scenario. The proposed defense method demonstrates strong effectiveness by significantly mitigating the attack's impact. It also substantially reduces the system's SER in the absence of an attack compared to the original model. Moreover, we extend the phenomenon to include decoder mobility, demonstrating that the proposed method maintains robustness under Doppler-induced channel variations.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Decoding in Concatenated Coding Schemes Under Synchronization Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the reconstruction of a codeword from multiple noisy copies that are independently corrupted by insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This problem arises, for example, in DNA data storage. A common code construction uses a concatenated coding scheme that combines an outer linear block code with an inner code, which can be either a nonlinear marker code or a convolutional code. Outer decoding is done with Belief Propagation, and inner decoding is done with the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. However, the BCJR algorithm scales exponentially with the number of noisy copies, which makes it infeasible to reconstruct a codeword from more than about four copies. In this work, we introduce BCJRFormer, a transformer-based neural inner decoder. BCJRFormer achieves error rates comparable to the BCJR algorithm for binary and quaternary single-message transmissions of marker codes. Importantly, BCJRFormer scales quadratically with the number of noisy copies. This property makes BCJRFormer well-suited for DNA data storage, where multiple reads of the same DNA strand occur. To lower error rates, we replace the Belief Propagation outer decoder with a transformer-based decoder. Together, these modifications yield an efficient and performant end-to-end transformer-based pipeline for decoding multiple noisy copies affected by insertion, deletion, and substitution errors. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-attending transformer architecture called ConvBCJRFormer. This architecture extends BCJRFormer to decode transmissions of convolutional codewords, serving as an initial step toward joint inner and outer decoding for more general linear code classes.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction over the Deletion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction problem in the case where the transmitted codeword is chosen from $\{0,1\}^n$ and the channel can delete up to $t$ symbols from the transmitted codeword. We determine the minimum number of channel outputs (assuming that they are distinct) required to reconstruct a list of size $\ell-1$ of candidate sequences, one of which corresponds to the original transmitted sequence. More specifically, we determine the maximum possible size of the intersection of $\ell \geq 3$ deletion balls of radius $t$ centered at $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{\ell}$, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}^n$ for all $i \in \{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ and $x_i \neq x_j$ for $i \neq j$, with $n \geq t+ \ell-1$ and $t \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis and Optimization of FIRES-Assisted NOMA and OMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid integrated reflecting and emitting surfaces (FIRES) are investigated. In these metasurfaces, each subarea hosts an active element capable of simultaneous transmission and reflection, phase, and geometric positioning control within the subarea. We develop a coverage-centric system model for the two-user downlink scenario (one user per half-space) under spatially correlated Rician fading and imperfect phase control. First, we derive closed-form far-field line-of-sight (LoS) coverage bounds that reveal the effects of aperture size, base station (BS) distance, transmit power, energy-splitting (ES), and phase errors. Protocol-aware corollaries are then presented for both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), including conditions for successful successive interference cancellation (SIC). Second, we formulate coverage maximization as a bi-level optimization problem consisting of (i) an outer search over FIRES element positions, selecting one active preset per subarea under minimum-spacing constraints, and (ii) an inner resource allocation problem tailored to the multiple-access scheme, which is one-dimensional for OMA and a small convex program for NOMA. The proposed framework explicitly accounts for target rate constraints, ES conservation, power budgets, geometric placement limits, and decoding-order feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that FIRES, by jointly exploiting geometric repositioning and passive energy control, substantially enlarges the coverage region compared with a conventional simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) under the same element budget. Furthermore, NOMA yields additional coverage gains when feasible. The analytical coverage bounds closely match the simulation results and quantify the robustness of FIRES to phase-control imperfections.</description>

      <title>Distributed Matrix Multiplication-Friendly Algebraic Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce distributed matrix multiplication (DMM)-friendly algebraic function fields for polynomial codes and Matdot codes, and present several constructions for such function fields through extensions of the rational function field. The primary challenge in extending polynomial codes and Matdot codes to algebraic function fields lies in constructing optimal decoding schemes. We establish optimal recovery thresholds for both polynomial algebraic geometry (AG) codes and Matdot AG codes for fixed matrix multiplication. Our proposed function fields support DMM with optimal recovery thresholds, while offering rational places that exceed the base finite field size in specific parameter regimes. Although these fields may not achieve optimal computational efficiency, our results provide practical improvements for matrix multiplication implementations. Explicit examples of applicable function fields are provided.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Model-Enabled Scenario-Specific Neural Receivers for Superimposed Pilot Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural receivers have demonstrated strong performance in wireless communication systems. However, their effectiveness typically depends on access to large-scale, scenario-specific channel data for training, which is often difficult to obtain in practice. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion models (DMs), have emerged as effective tools for synthesizing high-dimensional data. This paper presents a scenario-specific channel generation method based on conditional DMs, which accurately model channel distributions conditioned on user location and velocity information. The generated synthetic channel data are then employed for data augmentation to improve the training of a neural receiver designed for superimposed pilot-based transmission. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates high-fidelity channel samples and significantly enhances neural receiver performance in the target scenarios, outperforming conventional data augmentation and generative adversarial network-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Forget BIT, It is All about TOKEN: Towards Semantic Information Theory for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in numerous real- world applications. While the vast majority of research conducted from an experimental perspective is progressing rapidly, it demands substantial computational power, data, and other resources. Therefore, how to open the black-box of LLMs from a theoretical standpoint has become a critical challenge. This paper takes the theory of rate-distortion function, directed information, and Granger causality as its starting point to investigate the information-theoretic principles behind LLMs, leading to the development of semantic information theory for LLMs, where the fundamental unit is token, rather than bits that lacks any semantic meaning. By defining the probabilistic model of LLMs, we discuss structure-agnostic information-theoretic measures, such as the directed rate- distortion function in pre-training, the directed rate-reward function in post-training, and the semantic information flow in inference phase. This paper also delves deeply into the theory of token-level semantic embedding and the information-theoretically optimal vectorization method. Thereafter, we propose a general definition of autoregression LLM, where the Transformer architecture and its performance such as ELBO, generalization error bound, memory capacity, and semantic information measures can be derived theoretically. Other architectures, such as Mamba/Mamba2 and LLaDA, are also discussed in our framework. Consequently, this paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding LLMs from the perspective of semantic information theory, which also offers the necessary theoretical tools for further in-depth research.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Codes for Labeled DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeling of DNA molecules is a fundamental technique for DNA visualization and analysis. This process was mathematically modeled in [1], where the received sequence indicates the positions of the used labels. In this work, we develop error correcting codes for labeled DNA sequences, establishing bounds and constructing explicit systematic encoders for single substitution, insertion, and deletion errors. We focus on two cases: (1) using the complete set of length-two labels and (2) using the minimal set of length-two labels that ensures the recovery of DNA sequences from their labeling for 'almost' all DNA sequences.</description>

      <title>On the Ding and Helleseth's 9th open problem about optimal ternary cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cyclic code is a subclass of linear codes and has applications in consumer electronics, data storage systems and communication systems as they have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In 2013, Ding, et al. presented nine open problems about optimal ternary cyclic codes. Till now, the 1st, 2nd and 6th problems were completely solved, and the 3rd, 7th, 8th and 9th problems were partially solved. In this manuscript, we focus on the 9th problem. By determining the root set of some special polynomials over finite fields, we give an incomplete answer for the 9th problem, and then we construct two classes of optimal ternary cyclic codes with respect to the Sphere Packing Bound basing on some special polynomials over finite fields</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we construct a class of projective three- weight linear codes and two classes of projective four-weight linear codes over F2 from the defining sets construction, and determine their weight distributions by using additive characters. Especially, the projective three-weight linear code and one class of projective four-weight linear codes (Theorem 4.1) can be applied in secret sharing schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of constructing capacity-achieving codes from an algorithmic perspective. Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing machine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$ less than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a block code $\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a maximum block error probability below $\epsilon$. The machine operates in the general case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable real numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\epsilon$ are rational. The proof builds on Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem and relies on an exhaustive search approach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length until a valid code is found. This construction is formalized using the theory of recursive functions, yielding a $\mu$-recursive function $\mathrm{FindCode} : \mathbb{N}^3 \rightharpoonup \mathbb{N}$ that takes as input appropriate encodings of $p_{Y|X}$, $R$, and $\epsilon$, and, whenever $R &lt; C(p_{Y|X})$, outputs an encoding of a valid code. By Kleene's Normal Form Theorem, which establishes the computational equivalence between Turing machines and $\mu$-recursive functions, we conclude that the problem is solvable by a Turing machine. This result can also be extended to the case where $\epsilon$ is a computable real number, while we further discuss an analogous generalization of our analysis when $R$ is computable as well. We note that the assumptions that the probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$, as well as $\epsilon$ and $R$, are computable real numbers cannot be further weakened, since computable reals constitute the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ representable by algorithmic means.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph based lower bound on Pliable Index Coding based on Nested Side-Information Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information, and requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of length $\ell$ is a set of $\ell$ encoded transmissions broadcast from the server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum) length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we present a new lower bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter called the nesting number, denoted by $\eta(\ch)$ associated with the hypergraph $\ch$ that represents the PICOD problem. While the nesting number bound is not stronger than previously known bounds, it can provide some computational advantages over them. Also, using the nesting number bound, we obtain novel lower bounds for some PICOD problems with special structures, which are tight in some cases.</description>

      <title>Ergodic Rate Analysis of Two-State Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) represent a central paradigm in next-generation communication networks, aiming to transform wireless propagation from a passive medium into an intelligent and reconfigurable entity capable of dynamically adapting to network demands. In this context, pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have emerged as a promising enabler capable of reconfiguring both the channel characteristics and the path loss itself by selectively exciting radiation points along dielectric waveguides. However, existing studies largely rely on the assumption of continuously reconfigurable pinching antenna (PA) positions, overlooking the discreteness imposed by practical implementations, which allow for only a finite number of PA position. In this paper, an analytical framework is developed for evaluating the rate performance of two-state PASs, where the antenna locations are fixed, and only their activation states can be controlled. The analysis incorporates the discrete spatial structure of the waveguide and leads to a closed-form expression for the ergodic achievable data rate, while pinching discretization efficiency is introduced to quantify the performance deviation from the ideal continuous configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that near-continuous performance can be achieved with a limited number of PAs, offering valuable insights into the design and scalability of PASs in PWEs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures from Histogram Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector symbolic architectures (VSAs) are a family of information representation techniques which enable composition, i.e., creating complex information structures from atomic vectors via binding and superposition, and have recently found wide ranging applications in various neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Recently, Raviv proposed the use of random linear codes in VSAs, suggesting that their subcode structure enables efficient binding, while preserving the quasi-orthogonality that is necessary for neural processing. Yet, random linear codes are difficult to decode under noise, which severely limits the resulting VSA's ability to support recovery, i.e., the retrieval of information objects and their attributes from a noisy compositional representation.
  In this work we bridge this gap by utilizing coding theoretic tools. First, we argue that the concatenation of Reed-Solomon and Hadamard codes is suitable for VSA, due to the mutual quasi-orthogonality of the resulting codewords (a folklore result). Second, we show that recovery of the resulting compositional representations can be done by solving a problem we call histogram recovery. In histogram recovery, a collection of $N$ histograms over a finite field is given as input, and one must find a collection of Reed-Solomon codewords of length $N$ whose entry-wise symbol frequencies obey those histograms. We present an optimal solution to the histogram recovery problem by using algorithms related to list-decoding, and analyze the resulting noise resilience. Our results give rise to a noise-resilient VSA with formal guarantees regarding efficient encoding, quasi-orthogonality, and recovery, without relying on any heuristics or training, and while operating at improved parameters relative to similar solutions such as the Hadamard code.</description>

      <title>COOL Is Optimal in Error-Free Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COOL (Chen'21) is an error-free, information-theoretically secure Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol proven to achieve BA consensus in the synchronous setting for an $\ell$-bit message, with a total communication complexity of $O(\max\{n\ell, nt \log q\})$ bits, four communication rounds in the worst case, and a single invocation of a binary BA, under the optimal resilience assumption $n \geq 3t + 1$ in a network of $n$ nodes, where up to $t$ nodes may behave dishonestly. Here, $q$ denotes the alphabet size of the error correction code used in the protocol.
  In this work, we present an adaptive variant of COOL, called OciorACOOL, which achieves error-free, information-theoretically secure BA consensus in the asynchronous setting with total $O(\max\{n\ell, n t \log q\})$ communication bits, $O(1)$ rounds, and a single invocation of an asynchronous binary BA protocol, still under the optimal resilience assumption $n \geq 3t + 1$. Moreover, OciorACOOL retains the same low-complexity, traditional $(n, k)$ error-correction encoding and decoding as COOL, with $k=t/3$.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics: A Comprehensive Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics, the evolution of individuals through social interactions, is an important area of research with applications ranging from politics to marketing. Due to its interdisciplinary relevance, studies of opinion dynamics remain fragmented across computer science, mathematics, the social sciences, and physics, and often lack shared frameworks. This survey bridges these gaps by reviewing well-known models of opinion dynamics within a unified framework and categorizing them into distinct classes based on their properties. Furthermore, the key findings on these models are covered in three parts: convergence properties, viral marketing, and user characteristics. We first analyze the final configuration (consensus vs polarized) and convergence time for each model. We then review the main algorithmic, complexity, and combinatorial results in the context of viral marketing. Finally, we explore how node characteristics, such as stubbornness, activeness, or neutrality, shape diffusion outcomes. By unifying terminology, methods, and challenges across disciplines, this paper aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress in understanding and harnessing opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Fine-Tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for Automated Telecom Network Troubleshooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks, existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments. Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</description>

      <title>Binary perceptron computational gap -- a parametric fl RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) likely exhibits the so-called statistical-computational gap characterized with the appearance of two phase transitioning constraint density thresholds: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the \emph{satisfiability threshold} $\alpha_c$, below/above which ABP succeeds/fails to operate as a storage memory; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} \emph{algorithmic threshold} $\alpha_a$, below/above which one can/cannot efficiently determine ABP's weight so that it operates as a storage memory.
  We consider a particular parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) [85] and study its potential ABP's algorithmic implications. A remarkable structural parametric change is uncovered as one progresses through fl RDT lifting levels. On the first two levels, the so-called $\c$ sequence -- a key parametric fl RDT component -- is of the (natural) decreasing type. A change of such phenomenology on higher levels is then connected to the $\alpha_c$ -- $\alpha_a$ threshold change. Namely, on the second level concrete numerical values give for the critical constraint density $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx 0.8331$. While progressing through higher levels decreases this estimate, already on the fifth level we observe a satisfactory level of convergence and obtain $\alpha\approx 0.7764$. This allows to draw two striking parallels: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} the obtained constraint density estimate is in a remarkable agrement with range $\alpha\in (0.77,0.78)$ of clustering defragmentation (believed to be responsible for failure of locally improving algorithms) [17,88]; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} the observed change of $\c$ sequence phenomenology closely matches the one of the negative Hopfield model for which the existence of efficient algorithms that closely approach similar type of threshold has been demonstrated recently [87].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for quantum differential privacy (QDP) based on quantum hypothesis testing and Blackwell's ordering. This approach characterizes $(\eps,\delta)$-QDP via hypothesis testing divergences and identifies the most informative quantum state pairs under privacy constraints. We apply this to analyze the stability of quantum learning algorithms, generalizing classical results to the case $\delta&gt;0$. Additionally, we study privatized quantum parameter estimation, deriving tight bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</description>

      <title>Learning what to say and how precisely: Efficient Communication via Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective communication in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is critical for success but constrained by bandwidth, yet past approaches have been limited to complex gating mechanisms that only decide \textit{whether} to communicate, not \textit{how precisely}. Learning to optimize message precision at the bit-level is fundamentally harder, as the required discretization step breaks gradient flow. We address this by generalizing Differentiable Discrete Communication Learning (DDCL), a framework for end-to-end optimization of discrete messages. Our primary contribution is an extension of DDCL to support unbounded signals, transforming it into a universal, plug-and-play layer for any MARL architecture. We verify our approach with three key results. First, through a qualitative analysis in a controlled environment, we demonstrate \textit{how} agents learn to dynamically modulate message precision according to the informational needs of the task. Second, we integrate our variant of DDCL into four state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, showing it reduces bandwidth by over an order of magnitude while matching or exceeding task performance. Finally, we provide direct evidence for the \enquote{Bitter Lesson} in MARL communication: a simple Transformer-based policy leveraging DDCL matches the performance of complex, specialized architectures, questioning the necessity of bespoke communication designs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Movable Antenna Position and Transmissive RIS Phase for Efficient Base Station Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MA) and transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (TRIS) represent two innovative technologies that significantly enhance the flexibility of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel and compact base station architecture that synergistically integrates a movable antenna with a transmissive RIS in the near field, enabling joint optimization of antenna positioning and TRIS phase adjustments. The proposed model compensates for phase quantization loss and significantly enhances signal strength, even with low-resolution (1-2 bit) phase shifters. Leveraging this framework, we systematically evaluate system performance as a function of TRIS size and antenna placement. Our results indicate that antenna mobility provides an additional degree of freedom to enhance the desired signal and achieve a higher SNR, particularly when combined with TRIS capabilities. These findings demonstrate that MA-TRIS integration offers a cost-effective and energy-efficient pathway toward compact 6G base stations, combining hardware simplicity with strong performance gains.</description>

      <title>HyperNQ: A Hypergraph Neural Network Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing requires effective error correction strategies to mitigate noise and decoherence. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.</description>

      <title>Spherical Point Process with Random Heights: New Approach for Modeling and Analysis of Downlink Satellite Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite industry is undergoing rapid expansion, with operators competitively launching satellites due to the first-come, first-served principle governing orbital rights. This has led to the formation of increasingly large-scale, volumetric constellation where satellites operate across a diverse range of altitudes. To address the need for analyzing such complex networks, this paper establishes a new analytical framework for LEO constellations by leveraging a 3D Poisson point process (PPP). Specifically, we introduce a random height model (RHM) that can capture various altitude distributions by applying a random radial displacement to points generated by a homogeneous PPP on a nominal shell. Building on this, we derive an analytical expression for the downlink coverage probability. To motivate our model, we show that the altitude distributions of several leading satellite constellations, including Starlink, align with our model's assumptions. We then demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations that the coverage probability of our RHM closely matches that of these real-world networks. Finally, we confirm the accuracy of our analytical expressions by showing their agreement with simulation results. Our work thereby provides a powerful tool for understanding and predict how the statistical distribution of satellite altitudes impacts network performance.</description>

      <title>On the Complete Monotonicity of R\'enyi Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the complete monotonicity of R\'enyi entropy along the heat flow. We confirm this property for the order of derivative up to $4$, when the order of R\'enyi entropy is in certain regimes. We also investigate concavity of R\'enyi entropy power and the complete monotonicity of Tsallis entropy. We recover and slightly extend Hung's result on the fourth-order derivative of the Tsallis entropy, and observe that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of order $2$, which is equivalent to that the noise stability with respect to the heat semigroup is completely monotone. Based on this observation, we conjecture that the complete monotonicity holds for Tsallis entropy of all orders $\alpha\in(1,2)$. Our proofs in this paper are based on the techniques of integration-by-parts, sum-of-squares, and curve-fitting.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Stable Super-Resolution: Model-Based Formulation and Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mathematics, a super-resolution problem can be formulated as acquiring high-frequency data from low-frequency measurements. This extrapolation problem in the frequency domain is well-known to be unstable. We propose a model-based super-resolution framework (Model-SR) for solving the super-resolution problem and analyzing its stability, aiming to narrow the gap between limited theory and the broad empirical success of super-resolution methods. The key rationale is that, to be determined by its low-frequency components, the target signal must possess a low-dimensional structure. Instead of assuming that the signal itself lies on a low-dimensional manifold in the signal space, we assume that it is generated from a model with a low-dimensional parameter space. This shift of perspective allows us to analyze stability directly through the model parameters. Within this framework, we can recover the signal by solving a nonlinear least square problem and achieve super-resolution by extracting its high-frequency components. Theoretically, the resolution-enhancing map is proven to have Lipschitz continuity, with a constant that depends crucially on parameter separation conditions\. This separation condition can be effectively enforced via sparsity modeling, which requires using the minimal number of parameters to represent the measured signal, thereby highlighting the role of sparsity in the stability of super-resolution. Moreover, the Lipschitz constant grows with the high-frequency cutoff, ultimately rendering extrapolation ineffective beyond a certain threshold. We apply the general theory to three concrete models and give the stability estimates for each model. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the super-resolution behavior of the proposed framework. The model-based mathematical framework can be extended to problems with similar structures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes with Transversal Logical Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive two families of EA-QC quantum LDPC (EA-QC-QLDPC) codes by tiling permutation matrices of prime and composite orders. The unassisted portion of the Tanner graphs corresponding to these codes, constructed from two distinct classical QC-LDPC codes, exhibits girth greater then 4 an essential property for effective error correction. We analytically derive the exact code rate of the proposed constructions. Remarkably, one of these families requires only a single Bell pair to be shared between the quantum transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, two additional families of EA-QC-QLDPC codes are constructed based on a single classical code, whose Tanner graphs exhibit girths exceeding six, thereby further enhancing the error-correction capability. For one of these families, we explicitly determine the transversal logical operators an aspect that is typically non-trivial for random quasi-cyclic codes. The performance of the proposed codes is assessed under both random and burst error models under the depolarizing and Markovian noise actions. Employing a modified sum-product decoding algorithm over a quaternary alphabet, we demonstrate that correlated Pauli errors can be effectively addressed within the decoding framework. Simulation results reveal nearly an order of improvement in error-correction performance with the quaternary decoder compared to the binary decoder over both depolarizing and Markovian channels. Further, the proposed codes are compared with existing ones, demonstrating significant improvement.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a two users weak Gaussian interference channel can be achieved using single letter Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the value of any optimum solution for vector inputs does not exceed that of the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the optimum time-sharing is two. It is established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian code-books, achieves the optimum boundary. Even though the article focuses on weak interference, the results are applicable to the general case.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$--hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$--that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant transformations, also known as rotation-symmetric vectorial Boolean functions, on $n$ bits that are induced from Boolean functions on $k$ bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider such transformations that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective, and study their cryptographic properties. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its induced transformation that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its induced transformation is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between deep learning and information theory through the paradigm of diffusion models. A diffusion model converts noise into structured data by reinstating, imperfectly, information that is erased when data was diffused to noise. This information is stored in a neural network during training. We quantify this information by introducing a measure called neural entropy, which is related to the total entropy produced by diffusion. Neural entropy is a function of not just the data distribution, but also the diffusive process itself. Measurements of neural entropy on a few simple image diffusion models reveal that they are extremely efficient at compressing large ensembles of structured data.</description>

      <title>Large Intelligent Surfaces with Low-End Receivers: From Scaling to Antenna and Panel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feasibility of the promising large intelligent surface (LIS) concept, as well as its scalability, relies on the use of low-cost hardware components, raising concerns about the effects of hardware distortion. We analyze LIS systems with receive-chain (RX-chain) hardware distortion, showing how it may limit performance gains when scaling up these systems. In particular, using the memory-less polynomial model, analytical expressions are derived for the signal to noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) after applying maximum ratio combining (MRC). We also study the effect of back-off and automatic gain control on the RX-chains. The derived expressions enable us to evaluate the scalability of LIS when hardware impairments are present. The cost of assuming ideal hardware is further analyzed by quantifying the minimum scaling required to achieve the same performance with non-ideal hardware. The analytical expressions derived in this work are also used to propose practical antenna selection schemes for LIS, and we show that such schemes can improve the performance significantly leading to increased energy efficiency. Specifically, by turning off RX-chains with lower contribution to the post-MRC SNDR, we can reduce the energy consumption while maintaining performance. We also consider a more practical scenario where the LIS is deployed as a grid of multi-antenna panels, and we propose panel selection schemes to optimize the complexity-performance trade-offs and improve the system overall efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Augmenting a train of bright phase-modulated laser-light pulses of a coherent communications system with infinitesimally small quantum photons per pulse -- entangled across several time bins -- prepared by splitting squeezed light in a temporal-mode interferometer can dramatically enhance a homodyne receiver's ability to detect a sudden change in the channel loss, by up to a factor that is the inverse of the pre-change loss, without affecting the communications rate. We discuss the quantum limit of quickest change detection, and the problem of joint communications and change detection that our study opens up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over n channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation. Consequently, we establish achievability of the same covert entanglement generation rate as the classical information rate without secrecy, albeit with a larger key.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding the fundamental limits of AI explainability through algorithmic information theory. We formalize explainability as the approximation of complex models by simpler ones, quantifying both approximation error and explanation complexity using Kolmogorov complexity. Our key theoretical contributions include: (1) a complexity gap theorem proving that any explanation significantly simpler than the original model must differ from it on some inputs; (2) precise bounds showing that explanation complexity grows exponentially with input dimension but polynomially with error tolerance for Lipschitz functions; and (3) a characterization of the gap between local and global explainability, demonstrating that local explanations can be significantly simpler while maintaining accuracy in relevant regions. We further establish a regulatory impossibility theorem proving that no governance framework can simultaneously pursue unrestricted AI capabilities, human-interpretable explanations, and negligible error. These results highlight considerations likely to be relevant to the design, evaluation, and oversight of explainable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Wireless Semantic Communication with Large AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for 6G wireless systems by transmitting task-relevant information rather than raw bits, yet existing approaches remain vulnerable to dual sources of uncertainty: semantic misinterpretation arising from imperfect feature extraction and transmission-level perturbations from channel noise. Current deep learning based SemCom systems typically employ domain-specific architectures that lack robustness guarantees and fail to generalize across diverse noise conditions, adversarial attacks, and out-of-distribution data. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations. These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity across varying wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Framework for Understanding Modern Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework that views learning as universal prediction under log loss, characterized through regret bounds. Central to the framework is an effective notion of architecture-based model complexity, defined by the probability mass or volume of models in the vicinity of the data-generating process, or its projection on the model class. This volume is related to spectral properties of the expected Hessian or the Fisher Information Matrix, leading to tractable approximations. We argue that successful architectures possess a broad complexity range, enabling learning in highly over-parameterized model classes. The framework sheds light on the role of inductive biases, the effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent, and phenomena such as flat minima. It unifies online, batch, supervised, and generative settings, and applies across the stochastic-realizable and agnostic regimes. Moreover, it provides insights into the success of modern machine-learning architectures, such as deep neural networks and transformers, suggesting that their broad complexity range naturally arises from their layered structure. These insights open the door to the design of alternative architectures with potentially comparable or even superior performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Based Framework for Passive Intermodulation Cancellation in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from a nonderived $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and a nonderived $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>
