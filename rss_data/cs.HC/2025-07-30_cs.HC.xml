      <title>Enhancing Manufacturing Training Through VR Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary training for industrial manufacturing, reconciling theoretical knowledge with practical experience continues to be a significant difficulty. As companies transition to more intricate and technology-oriented settings, conventional training methods frequently inadequately equip workers with essential practical skills while maintaining safety and efficiency. Virtual Reality has emerged as a transformational instrument to tackle this issue by providing immersive, interactive, and risk-free teaching experiences. Through the simulation of authentic industrial environments, virtual reality facilitates the acquisition of vital skills for trainees within a regulated and stimulating context, therefore mitigating the hazards linked to experiential learning in the workplace. This paper presents a sophisticated VR-based industrial training architecture aimed at improving learning efficacy via high-fidelity simulations, dynamic and context-sensitive scenarios, and adaptive feedback systems. The suggested system incorporates intuitive gesture-based controls, reducing the learning curve for users across all skill levels. A new scoring metric, namely, VR Training Scenario Score (VRTSS), is used to assess trainee performance dynamically, guaranteeing ongoing engagement and incentive. The experimental assessment of the system reveals promising outcomes, with significant enhancements in information retention, task execution precision, and overall training efficacy. The results highlight the capability of VR as a crucial instrument in industrial training, providing a scalable, interactive, and efficient substitute for conventional learning methods.</description>

      <title>FingerTip 20K: A Benchmark for Proactive and Personalized Mobile LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks: proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users' previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information. Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FingerTip-57B8 for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Snap, Segment, Deploy: A Visual Data and Detection Pipeline for Wearable Industrial Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial assembly tasks increasingly demand rapid adaptation to complex procedures and varied components, yet are often conducted in environments with limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy requirements. These constraints make conventional cloud-based or fully autonomous solutions impractical for factory deployment. This paper introduces a mobile-device-based assistant system for industrial training and operational support, enabling real-time, semi-hands-free interaction through on-device perception and voice interfaces. The system integrates lightweight object detection, speech recognition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a modular on-device pipeline that operates entirely on-device, enabling intuitive support for part handling and procedure understanding without relying on manual supervision or cloud services. To enable scalable training, we adopt an automated data construction pipeline and introduce a two-stage refinement strategy to improve visual robustness under domain shift. Experiments on our generated dataset, i.e., Gear8, demonstrate improved robustness to domain shift and common visual corruptions. A structured user study further confirms its practical viability, with positive user feedback on the clarity of the guidance and the quality of the interaction. These results indicate that our framework offers a deployable solution for real-time, privacy-preserving smart assistance in industrial environments. We will release the Gear8 dataset and source code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Empowering Educators in the Age of AI: An Empirical Study on Creating custom GPTs in Qualitative Research Method education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity, improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking. However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and collaborative learning with AI.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason About Trust?: A Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions which can instil trust.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven and Participatory Approaches toward Neuro-Inclusive AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents, this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Level Hard in Super Mario Maker 2?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games like Super Mario Maker 2 (SMM2) lower the barrier for casual users to become level designers. In this paper, we set out to analyze a vast amount of data about SMM2 user-written levels, in order to understand what factors affect a level's difficulty as experienced by other users. To this end, we perform two kinds of analyses: one based on regression models and one using natural language processing techniques. The main results shed light on which level characteristics (e.g., its style, popularity, timing) and which topics and sentiments have a consistent association with easier or harder levels. While none of our findings are startling, they help distill some key differences between easy and hard SMM2 levels, which, in turn, can pave the way for a better understanding of end-user level design.</description>

      <title>Metaverse Support Groups for LGBTQ+ Youth: An Observational Study on Safety, Self-Expression, and Early Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assessed metaverse-based support groups designed to reduce social isolation and suicide risk among LGBTQ+ youths. Using the Cluster platform, enhanced anonymity, avatar-based self-expression, and accessibility were provided. Key findings showed that 79.2% chose avatars matching their gender identity, reporting high satisfaction (mean: 4.10/5) and low discomfort (mean: 1.79/5). Social confidence significantly improved in virtual spaces compared to real-world interactions (p&lt;0.001), particularly among participants with initially low confidence, averaging an increase of 2.08 points. About half of the first-time participants were 16 or younger, highlighting potential for early intervention. The metaverse scored higher than real-world environments for safety/privacy (3.94/5), self-expression (4.02/5), and accessibility (4.21/5). Additionally, 73.6% reported feeling more accepted virtually. However, some highly confident individuals offline experienced mild adaptation challenges, averaging a confidence decrease of 0.58 points, indicating virtual support complements rather than replaces in-person services. These findings suggest metaverse-based support effectively lowers psychological barriers and provides affirming spaces, potentially reducing severe outcomes such as suicidal ideation. Future studies should focus on integrating virtual support with existing community and clinical frameworks to enhance long-term impacts.</description>

      <title>Empathy in Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction, between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret. Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving explanations.</description>

      <title>Eliciting User Requirements for AI-Enhanced Learning Environments using a Participatory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21088v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the needs and expectations of educational stakeholders for AI (Artificial Intelligence)-enhanced learning environments. Data was collected following two-phased participatory workshops. The first workshop outlined stakeholders' profiles in terms of technical and pedagogical characteristics. The qualitative data collected was analysed using deductive thematic analysis with Activity Theory, explicating the user needs. The second workshop articulated expectations related to the integration of AI in education. Inductive thematic analysis of the second workshop led to the elicitation of users' expectations. We cross-examined the needs and expectations, identifying contradictions, to generate user requirements for emerging technologies. The paper provides suggestions for future design initiatives that incorporate AI in learning environments.</description>

      <title>Emotionally Aware Moderation: The Potential of Emotion Monitoring in Shaping Healthier Social Media Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques, such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry, Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.</description>

      <title>Thinking Like a Scientist: Can Interactive Simulations Foster Critical AI Literacy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.</description>

      <title>VizGenie: Toward Self-Refining, Domain-Aware Workflows for Next-Generation Scientific Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.</description>

      <title>Impact of eHMI on Pedestrians' Interactions with Level-5 Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, over half of global traffic fatalities involve vulnerable road users (e.g. pedestrians), often due to human error. Level-5 automated driving systems (ADSs) could reduce driver errors contributing to pedestrian accidents, though effectiveness depends on clarity and understandability for other road users. External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been proposed to facilitate pedestrian-ADS communication, though consensus on optimal eHMI features remains unclear. In an online survey, 153 participants responded to road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs, with and without eHMIs. With eHMIs, pedestrians crossed earlier and more confidently, and reported significantly increased perceptions of safety, trust, and understanding when interacting with level-5 ADSs. Visual eHMI features (including a text display and external speedometer) were ranked more necessary than auditory ones, though auditory cues received positive feedback. This study demonstrates that eHMIs can significantly improve pedestrians' understanding of level-5 ADS intent and enhance perceived safety and trust, facilitating more intuitive pedestrian-ADS interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge, neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support, offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive agents.</description>

      <title>InSituTale: Enhancing Augmented Data Storytelling with Physical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented data storytelling enhances narrative delivery by integrating visualizations with physical environments and presenter actions. Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.</description>

      <title>MindChat: Enhancing BCI Spelling with Large Language Models in Realistic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers can render a new communication channel independent of peripheral nervous system, which are especially valuable for patients with severe motor disabilities. However, current BCI spellers often require users to type intended utterances letter-by-letter while spelling errors grow proportionally due to inaccurate electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding, largely impeding the efficiency and usability of BCIs in real-world communication. In this paper, we present MindChat, a large language model (LLM)-assisted BCI speller to enhance BCI spelling efficiency by reducing users' manual keystrokes. Building upon prompt engineering, we prompt LLMs (GPT-4o) to continuously suggest context-aware word and sentence completions/predictions during spelling. Online copy-spelling experiments encompassing four dialogue scenarios demonstrate that MindChat saves more than 62\% keystrokes and over 32\% spelling time compared with traditional BCI spellers. We envision high-speed BCI spellers enhanced by LLMs will potentially lead to truly practical applications.</description>

      <title>Using Tactile Charts to Support Comprehension and Learning of Complex Visualizations for Blind and Low-Vision Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely only on assistive technologies -- primarily alternative texts -- to access this information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education.</description>

      <title>Conversations over Clicks: Impact of Chatbots on Information Search in Interdisciplinary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy as a Key Driver of User Experience in AI-Powered Assessment: Insights from Socratic Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind, an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement, and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction, in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective AI-based learning environments.</description>

      <title>Identification of Design Recommendations for Augmented Reality Authors in Corporate Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovative technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), introduce new interaction paradigms, demanding the identification of software requirements during the software development process. In general, design recommendations are related to this, supporting the design of applications positively and meeting stakeholder needs. However, current research lacks context-specific AR design recommendations. This study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing practical AR design recommendations relevant to the evaluation phase of the User-Centered Design (UCD) process. We rely on an existing dataset of Mixed Reality (MR) design recommendations. We applied a multi-method approach by (1) extending the dataset with AR-specific recommendations published since 2020, (2) classifying the identified recommendations using a NLP classification approach based on a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, (3) summarizing the content of all topics, and (4) evaluating their relevance concerning AR in Corporate Training (CT) both based on a qualitative Round Robin approach with five experts. As a result, an updated dataset of 597 practitioner design recommendations, classified into 84 topics, is provided with new insights into their applicability in the context of AR in CT. Based on this, 32 topics with a total of 284 statements were evaluated as relevant for AR in CT. This research directly contributes to the authors' work for extending their AR-specific User Experience (UX) measurement approach, supporting AR authors in targeting the improvement of AR applications for CT scenarios.</description>

      <title>Helping or Homogenizing? GenAI as a Design Partner to Pre-Service SLPs for Just-in-Time Programming of AAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices are used by many people around the world who experience difficulties in communicating verbally. One AAC device which is especially useful for minimally verbal autistic children in developing language and communication skills are visual scene displays (VSD). VSDs use images with interactive hotspots embedded in them to directly connect language to real-world contexts which are meaningful to the AAC user. While VSDs can effectively support emergent communicators, their widespread adoption is impacted by how difficult these devices are to configure. We developed a prototype that uses generative AI to automatically suggest initial hotspots on an image to help non-experts efficiently create VSDs. We conducted a within-subjects user study to understand how effective our prototype is in supporting non-expert users, specifically pre-service speech-language pathologists (SLP) who are not familiar with VSDs as an AAC intervention. Pre-service SLPs are actively studying to become clinically certified SLPs and have domain-specific knowledge about language and communication skill development. We evaluated the effectiveness of our prototype based on creation time, quality, and user confidence. We also analyzed the relevance and developmental appropriateness of the automatically generated hotspots and how often users interacted with the generated hotspots. Our results were mixed with SLPs becoming more efficient and confident. However, there were multiple negative impacts as well, including over-reliance and homogenization of communication options. The implications of these findings reach beyond the domain of AAC, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent across domains, including assistive technology. Future work is needed to further identify and address these risks associated with integrating generative AI into assistive technology.</description>

      <title>VeasyGuide: Personalized Visual Guidance for Low-vision Learners on Instructor Actions in Presentation Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instructors often rely on visual actions such as pointing, marking, and sketching to convey information in educational presentation videos. These subtle visual cues often lack verbal descriptions, forcing low-vision (LV) learners to search for visual indicators or rely solely on audio, which can lead to missed information and increased cognitive load. To address this challenge, we conducted a co-design study with three LV participants and developed VeasyGuide, a tool that uses motion detection to identify instructor actions and dynamically highlight and magnify them. VeasyGuide produces familiar visual highlights that convey spatial context and adapt to diverse learners and content through extensive personalization and real-time visual feedback. VeasyGuide reduces visual search effort by clarifying what to look for and where to look. In an evaluation with 8 LV participants, learners demonstrated a significant improvement in detecting instructor actions, with faster response times and significantly reduced cognitive load. A separate evaluation with 8 sighted participants showed that VeasyGuide also enhanced engagement and attentiveness, suggesting its potential as a universally beneficial tool.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Persona-Based Visualization of Election Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizations are essential tools for disseminating information regarding elections and their outcomes, potentially influencing public perceptions. Personas, delineating distinctive segments within the populace, furnish a valuable framework for comprehending the nuanced perspectives, requisites, and behaviors of diverse voter demographics. In this work, we propose making visualizations tailored to these personas to make election information easier to understand and more relevant. Using data from UK parliamentary elections and new developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), we create personas that encompass the diverse demographics, technological preferences, voting tendencies, and information consumption patterns observed among voters.Subsequently, we elucidate how these personas can inform the design of visualizations through specific design criteria. We then provide illustrative examples of visualization prototypes based on these criteria and evaluate these prototypes using these personas and LLMs. We finally propose some actionable insights based upon the framework and the different design artifacts.</description>

      <title>MapAgent: Trajectory-Constructed Memory-Augmented Planning for Mobile Task Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress, these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks. These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database. Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning. Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</description>

      <title>DataSway: Vivifying Metaphoric Visualization with Animation Clip Generation and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22051v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animating metaphoric visualizations brings data to life, enhancing the comprehension of abstract data encodings and fostering deeper engagement. However, creators face significant challenges in designing these animations, such as crafting motions that align semantically with the metaphors, maintaining faithful data representation during animation, and seamlessly integrating interactivity. We propose a human-AI co-creation workflow that facilitates creating animations for SVG-based metaphoric visualizations. Users can initially derive animation clips for data elements from vision-language models (VLMs) and subsequently coordinate their timelines based on entity order, attribute values, spatial layout, or randomness. Our design decisions were informed by a formative study with experienced designers (N=8). We further developed a prototype, DataSway, and conducted a user study (N=14) to evaluate its creativity support and usability. A gallery with 6 cases demonstrates its capabilities and applications in web-based hypermedia. We conclude with implications for future research on bespoke data visualization animation.</description>

      <title>High hopes for "Deep Medicine"? AI, economics, and the future of care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately, several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering</description>

      <title>SynLang and Symbiotic Epistemology: A Manifesto for Conscious Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang, together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of AI decision-making.</description>

      <title>GAITEX: Human motion dataset from impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises of inertial and optical sensor data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers, enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation, and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in machine learning-driven human movement analysis.</description>

      <title>Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied. This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text. Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content, organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities. Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics, temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement with AI text.</description>

Abstract: This qualitative study explores barriers to utilization of digital mental health Intervention (DMHI) among college students. Data are from a large randomized clinical trial of an intervention, eBridge, that used motivational interviewing for online counseling to connect students with mental health issues to professional services. We applied thematic analysis to analyze the feedback from the student participants regarding their experience of using the DMHI platform. We identified nine key barriers to DMHI adoption and the use of in-person mental health services: emotional distress, time constraints, privacy concerns, resource accessibility, financial challenges, medication stigma, dissatisfaction with communication, content clarity, and treatment-related concerns. Our findings emphasize the need for personalized, culturally sensitive interventions and improved strategies to enhance the access and engagement in mental health support for young adults.</description>

      <title>Adaptive XAI in High Stakes Environments: Modeling Swift Trust with Multimodal Feedback in Human AI Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI) approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG, ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation. At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive environments.</description>

      <title>Advancing Compositional LLM Reasoning with Structured Task Relations in Interactive Multimodal Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs. We will release our code to the community.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of AI RAG Tools for Complex Information Extraction and Data Annotation Tasks: A Case Study Using Banks Public Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an "interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill, not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in both the accuracy and speed of task performance.</description>

      <title>Sound Source Localization for Human-Robot Interaction in Outdoor Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios. Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within 5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.</description>

      <title>Finding Uncommon Ground: A Human-Centered Model for Extrospective Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However, such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.</description>

      <title>Can the current trends of AI handle a full course of mathematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Interactions between Automated Vehicles and Cyclists using a coupled In-the-Loop Test Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE) developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS evaluation.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the software development process away from traditional areas such as design or technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accuracy and speed are pivotal when typing. Mixed reality typing is typically performed by typing on a midair keyboard with your index fingers. This deprives users of both the tactile feedback available on physical devices and the ability to press keys with the most convenient finger. Our first experiment investigated providing tactile feedback by positioning the virtual keyboard on a table or wall. The keyboard was deterministic (without auto-correct), supported mixed case typing with symbols, and relied only on the hand-tracking provided by a commodity headset's egocentric cameras. Users preferred and had the highest entry rate of 12 words-per-minute using a midair keyboard. Error rates were similar in all conditions. Our second experiment explored ten-finger typing and used a novel eye-tracking technique to avoid accidental key presses. This technique was preferred for ten-finger typing and halved corrections. However, participants were faster using their index fingers without eye-tracking at 11 words-per-minute.</description>

      <title>MEDebiaser: A Human-AI Feedback System for Mitigating Bias in Multi-label Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical images often contain multiple labels with imbalanced distributions and co-occurrence, leading to bias in multi-label medical image classification. Close collaboration between medical professionals and machine learning practitioners has significantly advanced medical image analysis. However, traditional collaboration modes struggle to facilitate effective feedback between physicians and AI models, as integrating medical expertise into the training process via engineers can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce MEDebiaser, an interactive system enabling physicians to directly refine AI models using local explanations. By combining prediction with attention loss functions and employing a customized ranking strategy to alleviate scalability, MEDebiaser allows physicians to mitigate biases without technical expertise, reducing reliance on engineers, and thus enhancing more direct human-AI feedback. Our mechanism and user studies demonstrate that it effectively reduces biases, improves usability, and enhances collaboration efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating medical expertise into AI-driven healthcare.</description>

      <title>Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R^2 was used as a confidence metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation. Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient, generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly configurable.</description>

      <title>Decoding Instructional Dialogue: Human-AI Collaborative Analysis of Teacher Use of AI Tool at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17985</link>

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability. The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9 percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable, transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational practice.</description>

      <title>RISEE: A Highly Interactive Naturalistic Driving Trajectories Dataset with Human Subjective Risk Perception and Eye-tracking Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the research and development (R&amp;D) and verification and validation (V&amp;V) phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV) videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with 2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of the generated FPV videos are available in our website.</description>

      <title>CineVision: An Interactive Pre-visualization Storyboard System for Director-Cinematographer Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective communication between directors and cinematographers is fundamental in film production, yet traditional approaches relying on visual references and hand-drawn storyboards often lack the efficiency and precision necessary during pre-production. We present CineVision, an AI-driven platform that integrates scriptwriting with real-time visual pre-visualization to bridge this communication gap. By offering dynamic lighting control, style emulation based on renowned filmmakers, and customizable character design, CineVision enables directors to convey their creative vision with heightened clarity and rapidly iterate on scene composition. In a 24-participant lab study, CineVision yielded shorter task times and higher usability ratings than two baseline methods, suggesting a potential to ease early-stage communication and accelerate storyboard drafts under controlled conditions. These findings underscore CineVision's potential to streamline pre-production processes and foster deeper creative synergy among filmmaking teams, particularly for new collaborators. Our code and demo are available at https://github.com/TonyHongtaoWu/CineVision.</description>

      <title>Not someone, but something: Rethinking trust in the age of medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in healthcare, trust in medical decision-making is changing fast. Nowhere is this shift more visible than in radiology, where AI tools are increasingly embedded across the imaging workflow - from scheduling and acquisition to interpretation, reporting, and communication with referrers and patients. This opinion paper argues that trust in AI isn't a simple transfer from humans to machines - it is a dynamic, evolving relationship that must be built and maintained. Rather than debating whether AI belongs in medicine, it asks: what kind of trust must AI earn, and how? Drawing from philosophy, bioethics, and system design, it explores the key differences between human trust and machine reliability - emphasizing transparency, accountability, and alignment with the values of good care. It argues that trust in AI should not be built on mimicking empathy or intuition, but on thoughtful design, responsible deployment, and clear moral responsibility. The goal is a balanced view - one that avoids blind optimism and reflexive fear. Trust in AI must be treated not as a given, but as something to be earned over time.</description>

      <title>LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.</description>

      <title>Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.</description>

      <title>T2I-Copilot: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Text-to-Image System for Enhanced Prompt Interpretation and Interactive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings, denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/T2I-Copilot.</description>
