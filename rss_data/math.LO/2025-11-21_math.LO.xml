      <title>Generalized Descriptive Set Theory at Singular Cardinals of Countable Cofinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive development of the basics of descriptive set theory for non-separable complete metric spaces whose weight is a singular cardinal $\lambda$ of countable confinality. Somewhat unexpectedly, the resulting theory is remarkably similar to the classical one, although the methods used are necessarily fairly different and combine ideas and results from general topology, infinite combinatorics, and set theory.
  More in detail, we study $\lambda$-Polish spaces and standard $\lambda$-Borel spaces (characterization of the generalized Cantor and Baire spaces, analogues of the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, classification up to $\lambda$-Borel isomorphism, etc.), their $\lambda$-Borel hierarchy (structural properties, changes of topologies, and so on), $\lambda$-analytic sets (including generalizations of the Lusin separation theorem and of the Souslin theorem), $\lambda$-coanalytic sets (including $\lambda$-$\boldsymbol{\Pi}^1_1$-ranks and alike), and $\lambda$-projective sets. We also consider more advanced topics, and provide e.g. various uniformization results for $\lambda$-Borel set; these in turn lead to fundamental applications to the study of $\lambda$-Borel equivalence relations, such as a generalization of the celebrated Feldman-Moore theorem. Finally, we study a natural generalization of the classical Perfect Set Property, and develop tools to show that all definable sets enjoy such property under suitable large cardinal assumptions, most notably including Woodin's $\mathsf{I0}(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Provability interpretation of non-normal modal logics having neighborhood semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study provability predicates $\mathrm{Pr}_T(x)$ satisfying the following condition $\mathbf{E}$ from a modal logical perspective: $\mathbf{E}:$ if $ T \vdash \varphi \leftrightarrow \psi$, then $T \vdash \mathrm{Pr}_T(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Pr}_T(\ulcorner \psi \urcorner)$. For this purpose, we develop a new method of embedding models based on neighborhood semantics into arithmetic. Our method broadens the scope of arithmetical completeness proofs. In particular, we prove the arithmetical completeness theorems for the non-normal modal logics $\mathsf{EN}$, $\mathsf{ECN}$, $\mathsf{ENP}$, $\mathsf{END}$, and $\mathsf{ECNP}$.</description>

      <title>Coherent and ideal actions in ideally exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06124v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of ideally exact categories, we introduce the notions of internal coherent action and internal ideal action that generalise different aspects of unital actions of rings and algebras. We prove that every ideal action is coherent, and that the converse statement holds in some relevant ideally exact contexts. Furthermore, a connection with G. Janelidze's notion of semidirect product in ideally exact categories is analysed.</description>

      <title>Projectivity in topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study projectivity in the category of $G$-flows and affine $G$-flows for Polish groups $G$. We also introduce the notion of \emph{proximally irreducible} extensions between affine $G$-flows. Using this we provide a characterization of extreme amenability, strong amenability, and amenability for closed subgroups $H \leq G$ in terms of certain ``dynamical irreducibility'' properties of the Samuel compactification of $G/H$. We then apply this to answer an open question of Zucker by proving a structure theorem for when the universal minimal proximal flow of $G$ is metrizable or contains a comeager orbit.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras in continuous model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical model theory, the Keisler-Shelah theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the elementary equivalence of structures and the isomorphism of their ultrapowers. Motivated by this, one may ask whether an analogous relationship holds in the framework of continuous model theory, which naturally encompasses metric structures such as $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of operator algebras from a model-theoretic perspective. We prove that, assuming the negation of the continuum hypothesis, there exist two elementarily equivalent infinite-dimensional unital $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$ of size $\le \mathfrak c$ such that for all non-principal ultrafilters $\mathcal U, \mathcal V$ on $\omega$, the ultrapowers $A^{\mathcal U}$ and $B^{\mathcal V}$ are not isomorphic. This result provides a continuous analogue of certain classical theorems concerning ultraproducts and demonstrates that the model-theoretic behavior of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras is closely related to set-theoretic principles such as the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical completeness for some extensions of the pure logic of necessitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetical completeness theorems of some extensions of Fitting, Marek, and Truszczy\'{n}ski's pure logic of necessitation $\mathbf{N}$. For $m,n \in \omega$, let $\mathbf{NA}_{m,n}$, which was introduced by Kurahashi and Sato, be the logic obtained from $\mathbf{N}$ by adding the axiom scheme $\Box^n A \to \Box^m A$. In this paper, among other things, we prove that for each $m,n \geq 1$, the logic $\mathbf{NA}_{m,n}$ becomes a provability logic, that is, there exists a provability predicate $\mathrm{Pr}_T(x)$ of $T$ whose $T$-verifiable modal principles are exactly the logic $\mathbf{NA}_{m,n}$.</description>

      <title>Supervaluations, truth, and intuitionistic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supervaluationist approach to fixed-point semantics is, arguably, the most celebrated and studied competitor to the Strong Kleene approach within Kripkean truth. In this paper, we show how to obtain supervaluationist fixed-point theories of truth for intuitionistic logic. In particular, we show how to do supervaluations over Kripke structures for intuitionistic logic, and we obtain the corresponding theories of truth, both semantic and axiomatic. Furthermore, we technically compare our approach with previous attempts to formalize Kripkean supervaluational theories over possible-world semantics. Finally, we show that, unlike in the case of classical logic, a fixed-point theory over intuitionistic logic can be given that is both supervaluational and highly compositional in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Ditor asked two questions: (1) For each $n\in\omega$ and infinite cardinal $\kappa$, is there a join-semilattice of breadth $n+1$ and cardinality $\kappa^{+n}$ whose principal ideals have cardinality $&lt; \kappa$? (2) For each $n \in \omega$, is there a lower-finite lattice of cardinality $\aleph_{n}$ whose elements have at most $n+1$ lower covers? We show that both questions have positive answers under the axiom of constructibility, and hence consistently with $\mathsf{ZFC}$. More specifically, we derive the positive answers from assuming that $\square_\kappa$ holds for enough $\kappa$'s.</description>

      <title>A Proof Theory for Profinite Modal Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we showed that profinite $L$-algebras (where $L$ is a variety of modal algebras generated by its finite members) are monadic over $\mathbf{Set}$. This monadicity result suggests that profinite $L$-algebras could be presented as Lindenbaum algebras for propositional theories in infinitary versions of propositional modal calculi. In this paper we identify such calculi as modal enrichments of Maehara-Takeuti's infinitary extension of the sequent calculus $\mathbf{LK}$. We also investigate correspondences between syntactic properties of the calculi and regularity/exactness properties of the opposite category of profinite $L$-algebras.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>
