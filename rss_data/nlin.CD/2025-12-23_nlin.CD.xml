      <title>Linearly-scalable and entropy-optimal learning of nonstationary and nonlinear manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an Entropy-Optimal Manifold Clustering (EOMC) - and show that it mitigates the cost scaling and robustness issues of the existing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning tools in nonstationary and nonlinear situations, while pertaining the favourable O(T) iteration complexity scaling in the statistics size T. Applying EOMC to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system (a very popular model of a simplified atmosphere dynamics)in chaotic and strongly-chaotic regimes reveals that its dynamics is essentially described by a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent three-dimensional attractive manifolds. The dimensionality of these manifolds appears to remain unchanged, and their overall number gradually grows with the growing external forcing of the Lorenz-96 model. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents for this system, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others). These findings open new exciting opportunities for EOMC and transfer operator theory, by improving predictive skills and performance of data-driven tools in fluid mechanics and geosciences applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating Hamiltonian Dynamics by the Method of Covariant Lyapunov Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we review the theory of Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and use these objects to numerically investigate the dynamics of several autonomous Hamiltonian systems. The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&amp;C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&amp;C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the H\'enon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&amp;C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the H\'enon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions.</description>

      <title>Variation of entropy in the Duffing system with the amplitude of the external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the well-known perturbed Duffing system and investigate its chaotic dynamics by means of numerical Runge--Kutta method based on topological horseshoe theory. Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system.
  Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows.</description>

      <title>Kicked fluxonium with quantum strange attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dissipative time evolution of a fluxonium under a pulsed field (kicks) is studied numerically and analytically. In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Lindblad-Pauli Framework for Coarse-Grained Chaotic Binary-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-graining a chaotic bistable oscillator into a binary symbol sequence is a standard reduction, but it often obscures the geometry of the reduced state space and structural constraints of physically meaningful stochastic evolution. We develop a two-state framework that embeds coarse-grained left/right statistics of the driven Duffing oscillator into a $2\times2$ density-matrix representation and models inter-well switching by a two-rate Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) generator. For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations. The density-matrix formalism is an organizational convenience rather than claiming quantum-classical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics and Zero Distribution: Implications and Applications in Control Theory for Yitang Zhang's Landau Siegel Zero Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the realm of chaotic dynamics derived from Dirichlet L-functions, drawing inspiration from Yitang Zhang's groundbreaking work on Landau-Siegel zeros. The dynamic behavior reveals profound chaos, corroborated by the calculated Lyapunov exponents and entropy, attesting to the system's inherent unpredictability.
  Furthermore, we establish a novel connection between Fractal geometry and Quantum chaos, predicting the distributions of zeros for both Yitang dynamics and Riemann dynamics. These findings offer indirect support for Zhang's groundbreaking theorem concerning Landau-Siegel zeros and suggest that these chaotic dynamics could find application in engineering and control systems, demonstrating the potential to harness chaos for beneficial purposes.
  The exploration of stability within electrical systems further uncovers the instability of fixed points, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for harnessing chaotic behavior to achieve specific control objectives.
  This study not only contributes to our understanding of chaotic dynamics but also opens new avenues for exploring the potential applications of Yitang dynamics in the field of electrical control systems. It paves the way for innovative approaches to address real-world engineering challenges and may be considered as a new consequence for the generalized Riemann hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor. Previous work has shown that transfer learning can be used effectively with ESNs for single-orbit prediction. The novelty of our paper lies in our use of this pairing to predict the long-term statistical properties of spatiotemporally chaotic PDEs. We also show that transfer learning nontrivially improves the length of time that predictions of individual gKS trajectories remain accurate.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted significant interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, thus being modeled via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often exhibit non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. Previous studies have shown that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while they are easier to observe when the interactions are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called mdirected hypergraphs, which we compare with their corresponding networks, and we observe that chimera state and specifically amplitude-mediated chimeras can emerge due to directionality, which had not been previously observed in the absence of directionality. We also compare the effect of non-reciprocal interactions between higher-order and pairwise couplings, and we find numerically that chimera states appear over a broader parameter range when considering higher-order interactions than in the corresponding network case, demonstrating the impact of directionality and the effect of higher-order interactions. Finally, the nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>On the reconstruction map in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An open question in AdS/CFT is how to reconstruct semiclassical bulk operators precisely enough that non-perturbative quantum effects can be computed. We propose a set of physically-motivated requirements for such a reconstruction map, and explicitly construct a map satisfying these requirements in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. Our map is found by canonically quantizing "action-angle" variables for JT gravity, which are chosen to ensure that the spectrum of the fundamental quantum theory matches known results from the gravitational path integral. We then study unitary quantum dynamics in this theory, and obtain analytical predictions for the dynamics of the wormhole length, including its quantum fluctuations, leveraging techniques from quantum ergodicity theory. Level repulsion in the non-perturbative JT spectrum implies that the average wormhole length is non-monotonic in time, that fluctuations in wormhole length are non-perturbatively suppressed until nearly the Heisenberg time, and that the late-time-evolved Hartle-Hawking state has a heavy-tailed distribution of lengths. We discuss the implications of our results for the "complexity = volume" conjecture.</description>

      <title>Polarization and tranverse mode nonlinear dynamics in a multimode VCSEL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear dynamics and routes to chaos in a multimode vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (MM-VCSEL) in free-running operation. Including higher order transverse modes (TMs) results in additional bifurcations at higher currents not found for single-mode VCSELs (SM-VCSELs). The resulting dynamics involve competition between modes with different transverse profiles and polarization and show good qualitative agreement with recent experiments.</description>
