      <title>Phenomenology of many-body localization in bond-disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) in the Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model, where the Stark field of strength $\varepsilon$ is added onto the one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice. We perform scaling analysis and numerical calculations of the localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited states to characterize critical properties of the delocalization-localization transition. Remarkably, our scaling analysis shows that, near the critical point, the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\varepsilon$ as $\xi\propto\varepsilon^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ a new critical exponent for the AAS model, which is different from the counterparts for both the pure Aubry-Andre (AA) model and Stark model. The IPR $\mathcal{I}$ scales as $\mathcal{I}\propto\varepsilon^{s}$ with the critical exponent $s\approx0.098$, which is also different from both two pure models. The energy gap $\Delta E$ scales as $\Delta E\propto \varepsilon^{\nu z}$ with the same critical exponent $z\approx2.374$ as that for the pure AA model. We further reveal hybrid scaling functions in the overlap between the critical regions of the Anderson and Stark localizations. Moreover, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization transitions in the AAS model. By linearly changing the Stark (quasiperiodic) potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length and the IPR, and study their dependence on the driving rate. We find that the driven dynamics from the ground state is well described by the KZS with the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. When both the Stark and quasiperiodic potentials are relevant, the KZS form includes the two scaling variables. This work extends our understanding of critical phenomena on localization transitions and generalizes the application of the KZS to hybrid models.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated particle motion in biased correlated Gaussian disorder potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermally activated particle motion in disorder potentials is controlled by the large-$\Delta V$ tail of the distribution of height $\Delta V$ of the potential barriers created by the disorder. We employ the optimal fluctuation method to evaluate this tail for correlated quenched Gaussian potentials in one dimension in the presence of a small bias of the potential. We focus on the mean escape time (MET) of overdamped particles averaged over the disorder. We show that the bias leads to a strong (exponential) reduction of the MET in the direction along the bias. The reduction depends both on the bias, and on detailed properties of the covariance of the disorder, such as its derivatives and asymptotic behavior at large distances. We verify our theoretical predictions, as well as earlier predictions for zero bias, by performing large-deviation simulations of the potential disorder. The simulations employ correlated random potential sampling based on the circulant embedding method and the Wang-Landau algorithm, which enable us to probe probability densities smaller than $10^{-1200}$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic critical slowing down in complex systems: from statics to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider second-order phase transitions in which the order parameter is a replicated overlap matrix. We focus on a tricritical point that occurs in a variety of mean-field models and that, more generically, describes higher order liquid-liquid or liquid-glass transitions. We show that the static replicated theory implies slowing down with a logarithmic decay in time. The dynamical equations turn out to be those predicted by schematic Mode Coupling Theory for supercooled viscous liquids at a $A_3$ singularity, where the parameter exponent is $\lambda=1$. We obtain a quantitative expression for the parameter $\mu$ of the logarithmic decay in terms of cumulants of the overlap, which are physically observable in experiments or numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Overlap renormalization group transformations for disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a renormalization group approach which is implemented on the degrees of freedom defined by the overlap of two replicas to determine the critical fixed point and to extract four critical exponents for the phase transition of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we couple the overlap order parameter to a fictitious field and introduce it within the two-replica Hamiltonian of the system to study its explicit symmetry-breaking with the renormalization group. Overlap transformations do not require a renormalization of the random couplings of a system to extract the critical exponents associated with the relevant variables of the renormalization group. We conclude by discussing the applicability of such transformations in the study of any phase transition which is fully characterized by an overlap order parameter.</description>
