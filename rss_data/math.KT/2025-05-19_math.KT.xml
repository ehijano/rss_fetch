      <title>Total acyclicity of complexes over group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study group algebras over which modules have a controlled behaviour with respect to the notions of Gorenstein homological algebra, namely: (a) Gorenstein projective modules are Gorenstein flat, (b) any module whose dual is Gorenstein injective is necessarily Gorentein flat, (c) the Gorenstein projective cotorsion pair is complete and (d) any acyclic complex of projective, injective or flat modules is totally acyclic (in the respective sense). We consider a certain class of groups satisfying all of these properties and show that it is closed under the operation LH defined by Kropholler and the operation {\Phi} defined by the second author. We thus generalize all previously known results regarding these properties over group algebras and place these results in an appropriate framework.</description>

      <title>Trace methods for equivariant algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decades, one of the most fruitful approaches to the study of algebraic $K$-theory has been trace methods, which construct and study trace maps from algebraic $K$-theory to topological Hochschild homology and related invariants. In recent years, theories of equivariant algebraic $K$-theory have emerged, but thus far few tools are available for the study and computation of these theories. In this paper, we lay the foundations for a trace methods approach to equivariant algebraic $K$-theory. For $G$ a finite group, we construct a Dennis trace map from equivariant algebraic $K$-theory to a $G$-equivariant version of topological Hochschild homology; for $G$ the trivial group this recovers the ordinary Dennis trace map. We show that upon taking fixed points, this recovers the trace map of Adamyk--Gerhardt--Hess--Klang--Kong, and gives a trace map from the fixed points of coarse equivariant $A$-theory to the free loop space. We also establish important properties of equivariant topological Hochschild homology, such as Morita invariance, and explain why it can be considered as a multiplicative norm.</description>

      <title>Ricci-flat manifolds, parallel spinors and the Rosenberg index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any closed connected Riemannian spin manifold of non-zero $\hat{A}$-genus or non-zero Hitchin invariant with non-negative scalar curvature admits a parallel spinor, in particular is Ricci-flat. In this note, we generalize this result to closed connected spin manifolds of non-vanishing Rosenberg index. This provides a criterion for the existence of a parallel spinor on a finite covering and yields that any closed connected Ricci-flat spin manifold of dimension $\geq 2$ with non-vanishing Rosenberg index has special holonomy.</description>

      <title>Group class operations and homological conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kropholler's operation ${\scriptstyle{{\bf LH}}}$ and Talelli's operation $\Phi$ can be often used to formally enlarge the class of available examples of groups that satisfy certain homological conditions. In this paper, we employ this enlargement technique regarding two specific homological conditions. We thereby demonstrate the abundance of groups that (a) have virtually Gorenstein group algebras, as defined by Beligiannis and Reiten, and (b) satisfy Moore's conjecture on the relation between projectivity and relative projectivity, that was studied by Chouinard, Aljadeff, Cornick, Ginosar, Kropholler and Meir.</description>
