      <title>SuryaBench: Benchmark Dataset for Advancing Machine Learning in Heliophysics and Space Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a high resolution, machine learning-ready heliophysics dataset derived from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), specifically designed to advance machine learning (ML) applications in solar physics and space weather forecasting. The dataset includes processed imagery from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), spanning a solar cycle from May 2010 to July 2024. To ensure suitability for ML tasks, the data has been preprocessed, including correction of spacecraft roll angles, orbital adjustments, exposure normalization, and degradation compensation. We also provide auxiliary application benchmark datasets complementing the core SDO dataset. These provide benchmark applications for central heliophysics and space weather tasks such as active region segmentation, active region emergence forecasting, coronal field extrapolation, solar flare prediction, solar EUV spectra prediction, and solar wind speed estimation. By establishing a unified, standardized data collection, this dataset aims to facilitate benchmarking, enhance reproducibility, and accelerate the development of AI-driven models for critical space weather prediction tasks, bridging gaps between solar physics, machine learning, and operational forecasting.</description>

      <title>Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heliophysics is central to understanding and forecasting space weather events and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning. Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar evolution.</description>

      <title>Off-centre convective zones in mass accreting stellar models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the physical origin of transient off-centre convective zones (oCZs) that arise in mass accreting stellar models. Using detailed MESA simulations of binary evolution, we find that these oCZs are not numerical artefacts but emerge due to a local increase in density near the retreating edge of the convective core. The density enhancement raises the local opacity, which amplifies the radiative temperature gradient $\nabla_{\rm rad}$. If this gradient surpasses the Ledoux threshold $\nabla_{\rm L}$, defined by both thermal and compositional stratification, the region becomes convectively unstable. The resulting oCZs are detached from the convective core and transient: mixing within the oCZ erases the local gradient in mean molecular weight, leaving a sharp $\nabla_{\mu}$ discontinuity at the boundary, stabilizing the adjacent layers. This mechanism naturally explains the presence and evolution of oCZs, as previously reported in massive interacting stars.</description>

      <title>Minimum and maximum mass-luminosity relations for stripped stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass transfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical Wolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study the evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and stripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He burning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved phase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for stellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are either for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which reflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of partial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA synthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles, consisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He chemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main sequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to $\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to initially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a given mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a partially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He stars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total luminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to predict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and vice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial stripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind properties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere models.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment of metal-poor stars orbiting massive black hole companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Star-Formation Research and the Power of Participatory Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review participatory science programs that have contributed to the understanding of star formation. The Milky Way Project (MWP), one of the earliest participatory science projects launched on the Zooniverse platform, produced the largest catalog of ``bubbles'' associated with feedback from hot young stars to date, and enabled the identification of a new class of compact star-forming regions (SFRs) known as ``yellowballs'' (YBs). The analysis of YBs through their infrared colors and catalog cross-matching led to discovering that YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects embedded in clumps that range in mass from 10 - 10,000 solar masses and luminosity from 10 - 1,000,000 solar luminosities. The MIRION catalog, assembled from 6176 YBs identified by citizen scientists, increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass SFRs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Ongoing work utilizing data from the Spitzer, Herschel and WISE missions involves analyzing infrared color trends to predict physical properties and ages of YB environments. Methods include applying summary statistics to histograms and color-color plots as well as SED fitting. Students in introductory astronomy classes contribute toward continued efforts refining photometric measurements of YBs while learning fundamental concepts in astronomy through a classroom-based participatory science experience, the PERYSCOPE project. We also describe an initiative that engaged seminaries, family groups, and interfaith communities in a wide variety of science projects on the Zooniverse platform. This initiative produced important guidance on attracting audiences that are underserved, underrepresented, or apprehensive about science.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Influence from Planets on the Measured Rates of Period Change of Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measured rates of period change, $\dot{P}$, in the signals of pulsating white dwarf stars are often interpreted as direct detections of structural changes from secular cooling. Due to the intrinsic nature of this quantity, $\dot{P}$ analysis has been used to probe fundamental physics, such as constraining the mass of hypothetical axion particles. However, most white dwarfs are expected to host planets that could induce an external source of period change, caused by the light travel time variations from reflex motion about the system barycenter. Assuming a plausible distribution of planets that could orbit white dwarf stars, we quantify the amount of reflex motion expected from undiscovered planets as an important source of extrinsic error in $\dot{P}$ analyses. While the median error from reflex motion is $\sim10^{-15}$ ss$^{-1}$ (similar to the secular $\dot{P}$ rates expected for cool DAV pulsators), individual close-in planets could cause $\dot{P}$ errors as large as $10^{-11}$ ss$^{-1}$</description>

      <title>Barium isotopic ratios in metal-poor stars: calibrating the method with globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the nucleosynthesis processes behind heavy-element enrichment in stellar atmospheres is challenging. It typically relies on comparing observed abundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but this method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D hydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to measure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements that have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the study of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios are directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to provide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and r-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining barium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a carefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between subordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) value for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar evolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$ that can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic ratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch. The $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with that derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$ dependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the resonance line at $\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the isotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We provide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic ratios.</description>

      <title>Determining the magnetic field of active region plages using the whole CLASP2/2.1 spectral window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter missions, CLASP2 and CLASP2.1, demonstrated that the near-UV spectral region between 279.30 and 280.68 nm is suitable for studying the magnetism of the solar chromosphere. In particular, the spectropolarimetric observations in the Mg II h and k resonant doublet, Mn I 279.91 and 280.19 nm resonant lines, and Fe II 279.79 and 280.66 nm lines acquired by these suborbital space experiments have been proven useful for inferring the magnetic field stratification in the solar chromosphere. However, several lines of the CLASP2/2.1 spectral region with significant circular polarization signals had remained unexplored. After identifying two Ni I (279.95 and 280.59 nm), one Mn II (280.62 nm), and one Fe I (280.53 nm) lines, here we apply the Weak Field Approximation (WFA) to the spectropolarimetric observations of active region plages by CLASP2 and CLASP2.1. By comparing the results with previous studies, we are able to estimate the formation heights of these CLASP2/2.1 additional spectral lines and to demonstrate their suitability to determine the magnetic field stratification from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere.</description>

      <title>Early Evolution of the Cavity and Core of a Coronal Mass Ejection in the Inner Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) typically exhibit a three-component structure in white-light (WL) coronagraphs. Utilizing the seamless observations of the inner corona ($\le$ 3 R$_\odot$), we have revealed the early evolution of the cavity and core of a CME starting at $\sim$18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME originates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and compresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL is filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 \AA. The differential emission measure (DEM) analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from the core ($\sim$13.4 MK) to the cavity ($\sim$1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is significantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence ($\ge$ 2 MK). The effective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably due to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright core includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to $\sim$330 km s$^{-1}$), and residual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the core but lags by $\sim$4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at $\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest speeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the compression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of the CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the HC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density region between the CME front and the MFR.</description>

      <title>A unified picture of swirl-driven coronal heating: magnetic energy supply and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal heating problem is one of the most critical challenges in solar physics. Recent observations have revealed that small-scale swirls are ubiquitous in the photosphere and chromosphere, suggesting that they may play a significant role in transferring magnetic energy into the corona. However, the overall contribution of swirls to the total magnetic energy supply and subsequent coronal heating remains uncertain. To address this, we perform statistical analyses of simulated swirls using a three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation extending from the convection zone to the corona in the quiet Sun. Our results reveal that swirls account for approximately half of the total magnetic energy. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that swirls can trigger coronal heating events through magnetic reconnection. The occurrence frequency of these events follows a power-law-like distribution, consistent with observations of coronal heating signatures known as "nanoflares", indicating that swirls are promising candidates as their drivers.</description>

      <title>Pulsating and Non-pulsating Components of Detached Eclipsing Binaries in the $\delta$ Scuti instability strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsating detached eclipsing binary systems are crucial for studying the internal structure of oscillating stars. These systems are advantageous because binary effects on pulsations are minimal, allowing for more accurate determinations of fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and radius. They serve as unique laboratories for detailed investigations of pulsating stars. In this study, we focused on four detached eclipsing binaries exhibiting $\delta$ Scuti-type oscillations: HD 117476, 205 Dra, HY Vir, and V1031 Ori. Our preliminary investigation showed that all binary components of these targets lie within the $\delta$ Scuti instability strip. Therefore, we aimed to determine which components are pulsating and which are not, and to explore the differences between them. To achieve this, we analyzed TESS photometric data and high-resolution spectra of the targets. Radial velocity variations were measured, and atmospheric parameters for each component were derived using spectral disentangling or synthetic composite spectra. We also modeled the binary light and radial velocity curves to determine the fundamental physical parameters of the components. Furthermore, we examined pulsation properties using three different approaches to identify the pulsating components. The evolutionary status of the targets was also assessed. Our analysis revealed that, in each system, only one component exhibits $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations, while the others are non-pulsating. Interestingly, we found that the key difference between pulsating and non-pulsating components within the same binary is metallicity: the metal-rich components were found to be non-pulsators, supporting theoretical studies on the effect of metallicity on $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate of stellar evolution can rarely be measured in real time. The fastest evolution (excluding event-driven evolution), where stars may evolve measurably over decades, is during the post-AGB phase. In this paper we provide direct evidence for such a case. A secular, linear, factor of ~2.5 increase is found in the strength of the [O III] lines relative to H-beta over an 130 year period in the young, well-known, low excitation planetary nebula IC 418. The increase is caused by the rising temperature of the central star. We use photo-ionization models to derive a model dependent heating rate for the central star in the range 15-42 K\/yr. These derived heating rates are very sensitive to the stellar mass, and yield a central-star mass of 0.560-0.583 solar masses. Initial-final mass relations based on the Miller-Bertolami models give a progenitor main-sequence mass of 1.25-1.55 solar masses. IC 418 is a carbon rich planetary nebula and its central star, HD 35914, has evolved from an AGB carbon star. This result shows that carbon star formation at solar metallicity extends to these low masses. This is lower than commonly assumed and suggests that post-AGB evolution may be slower than recent post-AGB models predict.</description>

      <title>The Alma catalogue of OB stars. III. A cross-match with Gaia DR3 and an extension based on new spectral classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third installment of the Alma Luminous Star (ALS) catalogue, aimed at creating the most comprehensive and clean sample of Galactic massive stars. This update extends the sample by adding approximately 2000 OB stars, incorporating astrometric and photometric data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) alongside spectroscopic information from the Galactic O-Star Catalog based on recent ground-based spectroscopic surveys. Rigorous astrometric corrections are applied to Gaia DR3 parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry, ensuring accurate distance estimates through a Bayesian method suited to this stellar population's spatial distribution in the Milky Way. We perform some comparative analyses highlighting the improved distance accuracy over previous versions, underscore the importance of precise spectral classifications with competing catalogues, and identify areas for improvement in Gaia DR3 effective temperature and extinction estimates for massive stars. We also address the challenges of having robust definitions for these objects. In addition, we explore the catalogue's ability to trace Galactic features such as spiral arms, spurs and OB associations (with some insights on the nature of Gould's Belt). Finally, we discuss the potential for further expanding the sample with upcoming surveys. This effort marks a significant advancement in the creation of a reliable census of Galactic massive stars, contributing to our understanding of the Milky Way's structure and star formation history. This catalogue should serve as a valuable reference for the massive star community, supporting research on stellar interiors, winds, stellar feedback, and other processes that make OB stars key to the evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Time-Incremented Multiscale Evolution (TIME): A Code-Independent Method for Time-Domain 3D Hydrodynamics and its Application to Roche Lobe Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Many critical physical processes, such as Roche lobe overflow, strain modern simulation methods due to their durations and multidimensionality. Aims. We employ a novel method of time-domain multidimensional simulations to provide the first grid-based time domain 3D model of Roche lobe overflow using VH-1. Methods. Using a piecewise approach which alternates between high-resolution 3D dynamic modeling and computationally fast evolutionary modeling, we present and test a method capable of self-scaling variable time resolution at greatly reduced computational cost. Results. We find mass transfer in the test high mass x-ray binary M33 X-7 to be unstable and fully conservative in both mass and angular momentum transport onto the accretion disk beyond f &gt;~ 1.01. This phase begins on thermal timescales and accelerates to span &lt; 100 yrs beyond f &gt;= 1.1, while the non-conservative stable phase of f &lt;~ 1.01 occurs on roughly nuclear timescales. Conclusions. We identify a critical point f ~ 1.01 which terminates stable overflow, which may correspond to the point Mdot_L1 ~ Mdot_wind or Mdot_L1 ~ 10^-6 M_solar/yr in the general case.</description>

      <title>Convection-Driven Multi-Scale Magnetic Fields Determine the Observed Solar-Disk Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar disk is a continuous source of GeV--TeV gamma rays. The emission is thought to originate from hadronic Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) interacting with the gas in the photosphere and uppermost convection zone after being reflected by solar magnetic fields. Despite this general understanding, existing theoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and the uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale magnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also generating turbulence-scale Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that the larger-scale filamentary field shapes the overall gamma-ray emission spectrum, and the Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence is critical for further suppressing the gamma-ray emission spectrum below $\sim 100$~GeV. For a standard Alfv\'{e}n wave turbulence level, our model's predicted spectrum slope from 1~GeV to 1~TeV is in excellent agreement with observations from Fermi-LAT and HAWC, an important achievement. The predicted absolute flux is a factor of 2--5 lower than the observed data; we outline future directions to resolve this discrepancy. The key contribution of our work is providing a new theoretical framework for using solar disk gamma-ray observations to probe hadronic GCR transport in the lower solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Two warm Earth-sized exoplanets and an Earth-sized candidate in the M5V-M6V binary system TOI-2267</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report two warm Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the close binary TOI-2267 (M5+M6, separation ~8 au). Data from TESS and ground-based facilities confirm the planets, but we cannot determine which star they orbit. The planets have radii of 1.00+/-0.11 R_Earth (TOI-2267 b, P=2.28 d) and 1.14+/-0.13 R_Earth (TOI-2267 c, P=3.49 d) if around TOI-2267A, or 1.22+/-0.29 R_Earth and 1.36+/-0.33 R_Earth if around TOI-2267B. TESS also shows a candidate signal (TOI-2267.02, P=2.03 d, 0.95+/-0.12 or 1.13+/-0.30 R_Earth). Dynamical analysis shows all three cannot orbit one star; the most stable configuration has planets b and c (near a 3:2 resonance) orbiting one star and the candidate the other. This scenario would make TOI-2267 the most compact binary system known to host planets, with both components harbouring transiting worlds, offering a unique benchmark for studying planet formation and evolution in compact binary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely established that globular clusters host robust populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes throughout their lifetimes. Within clusters, dynamical processes enabled by stellar densities thousands to millions of times larger than typical galactic environments facilitate interactions involving these stellar remnants that give rise to an array of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, stellar clusters have emerged as an important formation site for X-ray sources, radio pulsars, and merging black hole binaries similar to those recently detected as gravitational wave sources by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Disk Substructures Associated with the Young Eruptive Star EX Lupi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution ALMA Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the VLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.</description>

      <title>The Prime Focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME): First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.</description>

      <title>A search for the favored hyperfine transition of a 6.7 GHz methanol maser line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarized emission of astrophysical masers, especially OH and methanol lines, is an effective tool to study the magnetic field in high-mass star-forming regions. The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman effect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser emission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We aim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol maser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the excited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser emission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser emissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known high-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed in full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser features of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and circularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs. Specifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH maser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and W75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the same magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of the magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH and methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values present in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating hyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow the choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3-&gt;4, 6-&gt;7A, and 7-&gt;8.</description>

      <title>MUSE Observations Reveal Optical Coronal Iron Lines from Shock Emission in Supernova Remnant 0540-69.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the optical shock emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnant 0540-69.3 (SNR 0540) using MUSE integral-field-unit data from the VLT. The observations cover the spectral range 4650-9300 $\r{A}$ and provide a $1\times1$ arcmin$^{2}$ field of view, encompassing nearly the entire remnant. We analyse the spatial and spectral properties of shock-related emission lines, and identify clumpy optical shock emission e.g. from [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublet and the coronal [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303 line (typically at radial velocities $\lesssim|100|$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim|170|$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively). These features trace the blast-wave shell seen in previous X-ray studies. Post-shock electron density estimates, based on the [S II]-line ratio, reveal spatial variation, with the highest densities ($\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) in the bright knots in the west, and lower densities ($\sim3\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) in the east. The density in the north (southwest) appears significantly lower (higher) but remains unconstrained due to limited signal. We also estimate blast-wave shock velocities using the [Fe XIV] $\lambda$5303/[Fe XI] $\lambda$7892 ratio, finding low velocities ($\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with previous studies. All these results support the scenario that the blast wave is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium, particularly in the western regions. Additionally, we detect four unidentified emission lines, $\sim$2000-3000 km s$^{-1}$ south from the pulsar in transverse velocity, but their origin remains unclear. Possible explanations, including Fe lines from a high-velocity ejecta clump, all present challenges. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the circum- and interstellar medium surrounding SNR 0540.</description>

      <title>Abundance Diagnostics from Slitless Imaging Spectrometer: A Proof-of-Concept for MaGIXS-2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental abundance diagnostics in the solar corona are crucial for understanding energy transport, plasma heating, and magnetic activity. Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept technique for elemental abundance diagnostics from overlappograms, demonstrating its feasibility with simulated MaGIXS-2 observations.</description>

      <title>Explosions of pulsating red supergiants: a natural pathway for the diversity of Type II-P/L supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II supernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory. The pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN. However, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor models and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15 solar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We find the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a transient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a steady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they are driven by the $\kappa\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between changing opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and helium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in different parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor properties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We simulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions in the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast, the SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a Type II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline rates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in the density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization structure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that some of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by RSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might even lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased diversity in SN light curves.</description>

      <title>A Deep, High-Angular Resolution 3D Dust Map of the Southern Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deep, high-angular resolution 3D dust map of the southern Galactic plane over $239^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 6^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$ built on photometry from the DECaPS2 survey, in combination with photometry from VVV, 2MASS, and unWISE and parallaxes from Gaia DR3 where available. To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MIST stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of $1'$, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of $d \approx$ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly $A_V \approx 12$ mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps. When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk $|b| &lt; 10^\circ$. Our map serves as a pathfinder for the future of 3D dust mapping in the era of LSST and Roman, targeting regimes accessible with deep optical and near-infrared photometry but often inaccessible with Gaia.</description>

      <title>Early and Extensive Ultraviolet Through Near Infrared Observations of the Intermediate-Luminosity Type Iax Supernovae 2024pxl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.</description>

      <title>Tools for High Precision Photometry from Wide-Field Color Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AstroWISP: a collection of image processing tools for source extraction, background determination, point spread function/pixel response function fitting, and aperture photometry. AstroWISP is particularly well-suited for working with detectors featuring a Bayer mask (an array of microfilters applied to each detector pixel to allow color photography), such as consumer DSLR cameras. Such detectors pose significant challenges for existing tools while offering a much cheaper alternative to specialized devices. As a result, consumer DSLR cameras with Bayer masks are often underutilized for precision photometry. \astrowisp{} addresses this limitation in an effort to democratize precision photometry and support broader community participation in research. We demonstrate that our tools produce high-precision photometry from such images, enabling the use of such devices for detecting exoplanet transits. We package our tools for all major operating systems to ensure accessibility for amateur astronomers.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LXVIII. Characterization of the outer substellar companion around HD 72659 with a multi-technique approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before discovering the first exoplanets, the Radial Velocity (RV) method had been used for decades to discover binary stars. Despite significant advancements in this technique, it is limited by the intrinsic mass-inclination degeneracy that can be broken when combining RVs with astrometry, which allows us to determine the orbital inclination, or direct imaging, from which we can estimate the true mass of the target. HD 72659 is a solar analog known to host a gas giant on a $\sim 10$-yr orbit and a massive outer companion. This work aims to confirm HD 72659 c, which was recently announced using data from HIRES and HARPS spectrographs in combination with Gaia's astrometric data. We monitored HD 72659 with HARPS-N in the framework of the GAPS project since 2012. We now combined our 91 spectra with literature data and Gaia DR3 high-precision astrometry to constrain the mass and the orbit of this object ($M_{\rm c} \sim 19$ $M_{\rm J}$, $a \sim 21$ au) that falls in the Brown Dwarf desert. Moreover, we analyzed our high-resolution imaging observation taken with SPHERE, but since the target was not detected, we could only derive upper limits on its mass. We characterize the orbital parameters of HD 72659 c, confirming the literature mass of this object but finding a period twice as high as previously reported, and we also refine the parameters of planet b with reduced uncertainties compared to previous works. Finally, we analyze and discuss the dynamic configuration of this system, finding that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism may be at work.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</description>
