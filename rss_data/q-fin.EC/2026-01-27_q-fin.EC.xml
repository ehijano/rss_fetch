      <title>From annual to quarterly data: challenges and strategies in the estimation of Italian General Government Compensation of employees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the methodology for the quarterly estimation of Compensation of Employees paid by the General Government (GG) sector, in accordance with the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010). Due to the limited high-frequency data availability and the need to guarantee the consistency with annual constraints, quarterly estimation relies on indirect temporal disaggregation techniques. These methods use specific infra-annual indicators as proxies for the variables being estimated. The specific case of the quarterly estimation of Compensation of employees presents several additional challenges. Firstly, the information provided by the sources, based on cash or legal-accrual data, is elaborated to define indicators which respect the accrual ESA 2010 principle as the annual estimates, based on more compliant data sources such as final budgets of public entities. Secondly, at a quarterly level the extraordinary events - such as the recording of delayed collective bargaining agreements which result in arrears - have a strong impact on quarterly indicators, whereas their effect is mitigated at annual level. To attribute these flows to the period when the work is performed, multi-source data harmonization techniques are employed. Thirdly, to accurately reflect intra-annual dynamics, information is collected for specific groups of GG entities (e.g., regions and provinces) and aggregated into ESA 2010 GG sub-sectors (Central Government, Local Government, Social Security Funds) leading to three specific estimates. To validate temporal disaggregation models and ensure methodological rigor and data quality, statistical tests are applied throughout the process. The results confirm the effectiveness of this methodology in providing accurate and timely quarterly estimates of Compensation of employees for the GG sector, thereby supporting reliable short-term economic analysis and policy making.</description>

      <title>Bridging Expectation Signals: LLM-Based Experiments and a Behavioral Kalman Filter Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs increasingly function as economic agents, the specific mechanisms LLMs use to update their belief with heterogeneous signals remain opaque. We design experiments and develop a Behavioral Kalman Filter framework to quantify how LLM-based agents update expectations, acting as households or firm CEOs, update expectations when presented with individual and aggregate signals. The results from experiments and model estimation reveal four consistent patterns: (1) agents' weighting of priors and signals deviates from unity; (2) both household and firm CEO agents place substantially larger weights on individual signals compared to aggregate signals; (3) we identify a significant and negative interaction between concurrent signals, implying that the presence of multiple information sources diminishes the marginal weight assigned to each individual signal; and (4) expectation formation patterns differ significantly between household and firm CEO agents. Finally, we demonstrate that LoRA fine-tuning mitigates, but does not fully eliminate, behavioral biases in LLM expectation formation.</description>

      <title>BASTION: A Bayesian Framework for Trend and Seasonality Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BASTION (Bayesian Adaptive Seasonality and Trend DecompositION), a flexible Bayesian framework for decomposing time series into trend and multiple seasonality components. We cast the decomposition as a penalized nonparametric regression and establish formal conditions under which the trend and seasonal components are uniquely identifiable, an issue only treated informally in the existing literature. BASTION offers three key advantages over existing decomposition methods: (1) accurate estimation of trend and seasonality amidst abrupt changes, (2) enhanced robustness against outliers and time-varying volatility, and (3) robust uncertainty quantification. We evaluate BASTION against established methods, including TBATS, STR, and MSTL, using both simulated and real-world datasets. By effectively capturing complex dynamics while accounting for irregular components such as outliers and heteroskedasticity, BASTION delivers a more nuanced and interpretable decomposition. To support further research and practical applications, BASTION is available as an R package at https://github.com/Jasoncho0914/BASTION</description>

      <title>Digital Euro: Frequently Asked Questions Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European Central Bank (ECB) is working on the "digital euro", an envisioned retail central bank digital currency for the Euro area. In this article, we take a closer look at the "digital euro FAQ", which provides answers to 26 frequently asked questions about the digital euro, and other published documents by the ECB on the topic. We question the provided answers based on our analysis of the current design in terms of privacy, technical feasibility, risks, costs and utility. In particular, we discuss the following key findings:
  (KF1) Central monitoring of all online digital euro transactions by the ECB threatens privacy even more than contemporary digital payment methods with segregated account databases.
  (KF2) The ECB's envisioned concept of a secure offline version of the digital euro offering full anonymity is in strong conflict with the actual history of hardware security breaches and mathematical evidence against it.
  (KF3) The legal and financial liabilities for the various parties involved remain unclear.
  (KF4) The design lacks well-specified economic incentives for operators as well as a discussion of its economic impact on merchants.
  (KF5) The ECB fails to identify tangible benefits the digital euro would create for society, in particular given that the online component of the proposed infrastructure mainly duplicates existing payment systems.
  (KF6) The design process has been exclusionary, with critical decisions being set in stone before public consultations. Alternative and open design ideas have not even been discussed by the ECB.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Media on Music Demand: Evidence from Quasi-Natural Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how TikTok affects demand for music on paid streaming platforms. We use two quasi-exogenous disruptions to TikTok access that generate independent variation in exposure: Universal Music Group's (UMG) global withdrawal of its catalog from TikTok in February 2024, and the 2025 U.S. TikTok outage and subsequent install restriction. Across both settings, we reach the same bottom-line conclusion: reductions in TikTok access lower off-platform streaming demand. Recent work using the UMG setting reaches mixed conclusions about whether TikTok primarily promotes or cannibalizes streaming demand. We show that these findings can be reconciled once we account for power-law-like concentration in exposure (10% of songs account for 95% of TikTok creations) and that, in such environments, common DiD implementations (levels, log, and Poisson) target different estimands and impose different counterfactual trend restrictions. We document sharp heterogeneity: the typical long-tail song exhibits little change when TikTok access is removed, while highly viral titles experience meaningful declines in Spotify streams. Because the viral head accounts for a disproportionate share of total listening and revenue, these losses drive the market-level implications. The evidence is consistent with a mechanism in which TikTok operates as an upstream source of discovery and Spotify playlists act as a downstream amplification layer: declines increase with TikTok virality, UMG songs with no prior TikTok exposure show null effects, and UMG songs accumulate fewer followers on Spotify curated playlists. We also document downstream consequences for rights holders, with UMG songs becoming less likely to reach top charts.</description>

      <title>Location-Robust Cost-Preserving Blended Pricing for Multi-Campus AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale AI data center portfolios procure identical SKUs across geographically heterogeneous campuses, yet finance and operations require a single system-level 'world price' per SKU for budgeting and planning. A common practice is deployment-weighted blending of campus prices, which preserves total cost but can trigger Simpson-type aggregation failures: heterogeneous location mixes can reverse SKU rankings and distort decision signals.
  I formalize cost-preserving blended pricing under location heterogeneity and propose two practical operators that reconcile accounting identity with ranking robustness and production implementability. A two-way fixed-effects operator separates global SKU effects from campus effects and restores exact cost preservation via scalar normalization, providing interpretable decomposition and smoothing under mild missingness. A convex common-weight operator computes a single set of campus weights under accounting constraints to enforce a location-robust benchmark and prevent dominance reversals; I also provide feasibility diagnostics and a slack-based fallback for extreme mix conditions. Simulations and an AI data center OPEX illustration show substantial reductions in ranking violations relative to naive blending while maintaining cost accuracy, with scalable distributed implementation.</description>

      <title>Market Beliefs about Open vs. Closed AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market expectations about AI's economic impact may influence interest rates. Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. The different movements suggest that that markets may anticipate open and closed AI advances to have different economic implications, and that the cumulative impact of AI releases on bond yields may be more muted.</description>

      <title>The R&amp;D Productivity Puzzle: Innovation Networks with Heterogeneous Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce heterogeneous R&amp;D productivities into an endogenous R&amp;D network formation model, generalizing the framework of Goyal and Moraga-Gonz\'{a}lez (2001). Heterogeneous productivities endogenously create asymmetric gains from collaboration: less productive firms benefit disproportionately from links, while more productive firms exert greater R&amp;D effort and incur higher costs. When productivity gaps are sufficiently large, more productive firms experience lower profits from collaborating with less productive partners. As a result, the complete network -- stable under homogeneity -- becomes unstable, and the positive assortative (PA) network, in which firms cluster by R&amp;D productivity, emerges as pairwise stable. Using simulations, we show that the clustered structure delivers higher welfare than the complete network; nevertheless, welfare under this formation follows an inverted U-shape as the fraction of high-productivity firms increases, reflecting crowding-out effects at high fractions. Altogether, we uncover an R&amp;D productivity puzzle: economies with higher average R&amp;D productivity may exhibit lower welfare through (i) the formation of alternative stable networks, or (ii) a crowding-out effect of high-productivity firms. Our findings highlight that productivity is a structural force reshaping the organization of innovation. Productivity-enhancing policies must therefore account for their effects on endogenous R&amp;D alliances and effort, as they may reverse the intended welfare gains.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control with measurable coefficients via $L^p$-viscosity solutions and applications to optimal advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control control problems with merely measurable coefficients are not well understood. In this manuscript, we consider fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in infinite horizon with measurable coefficients and (local) uniformly elliptic diffusion. Using the theory of $L^p$-viscosity solutions, we show existence of an $L^p$-viscosity solution $v\in W_{\rm loc}^{2,p}$ of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which, in turn, is also a strong solution (i.e. it satisfies the HJB equation pointwise a.e.). We are then led to prove verification theorems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. These results allow us to construct optimal feedback controls and to characterize the value function as the unique $L^p$-viscosity solution of the HJB equation. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results for fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients. We use the theory developed to solve a stochastic optimal control problem arising in economics within the context of optimal advertising.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for optimizing service range allocation and designing incentive structures in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery networks.</description>
