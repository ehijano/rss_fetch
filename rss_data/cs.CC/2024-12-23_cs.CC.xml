      <title>Computational Complexity of Game Boy Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the computational complexity of several popular video games released for the Nintendo Game Boy video game console. We analyze the complexity of generalized versions of four popular Game Boy games: Donkey Kong, Wario Land, Harvest Moon GB, and Mole Mania. We provide original proofs showing that these games are \textbf{NP}-hard. Our proofs rely on Karp reductions from four of Karp's original 21 \textbf{NP}-complete problems: \textsc{Sat}, \textsc{3-Cnf-Sat}, \textsc{Hamiltonian Cycle}, and \textsc{Knapsack}. We also discuss proofs easily derived from known results demonstrating the \textbf{NP}-hardness of Lock `n' Chase and The Lion King.</description>

      <title>Distance Vector Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue that has become dominant with the rise of social media. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, once immunized, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named {\em Distance Vector Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination, at individual (i.e., vertex) level. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to several standard and structural parameters. We prove the W[1]-hardness of the problem with respect to neighborhood diversity, even when all the distances are $1$. We also give fixed-parameter algorithms for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of (d,r)-Domination via Modular Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models on Small Resource-Constrained Systems: Performance Characterization, Analysis and Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI like the Large Language Models (LLMs) has become more available for the general consumer in recent years. Publicly available services, e.g., ChatGPT, perform token generation on networked cloud server hardware, effectively removing the hardware entry cost for end users. However, the reliance on network access for these services, privacy and security risks involved, and sometimes the needs of the application make it necessary to run LLMs locally on edge devices. A significant amount of research has been done on optimization of LLMs and other transformer-based models on non-networked, resource-constrained devices, but they typically target older hardware. Our research intends to provide a 'baseline' characterization of more recent commercially available embedded hardware for LLMs, and to provide a simple utility to facilitate batch testing LLMs on recent Jetson hardware. We focus on the latest line of NVIDIA Jetson devices (Jetson Orin), and a set of publicly available LLMs (Pythia) ranging between 70 million and 1.4 billion parameters. Through detailed experimental evaluation with varying software and hardware parameters, we showcase trade-off spaces and optimization choices. Additionally, we design our testing structure to facilitate further research that involves performing batch LLM testing on Jetson hardware.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantages in (n,d)-&gt;1 Random Access Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.03045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>Corners in Quasirandom Groups via Sparse Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>
