      <title>Gem: Gaussian Mixture Model Embeddings for Numerical Feature Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embeddings are now used to underpin a wide variety of data management tasks, including entity resolution, dataset search and semantic type detection. Such applications often involve datasets with numerical columns, but there has been more emphasis placed on the semantics of categorical data in embeddings than on the distinctive features of numerical data. In this paper, we propose a method called Gem (Gaussian mixture model embeddings) that creates embeddings that build on numerical value distributions from columns. The proposed method specializes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify and cluster columns with similar value distributions. We introduce a signature mechanism that generates a probability matrix for each column, indicating its likelihood of belonging to specific Gaussian components, which can be used for different applications, such as to determine semantic types. Finally, we generate embeddings for three numerical data properties: distributional, statistical, and contextual. Our core method focuses solely on numerical columns without using table names or neighboring columns for context. However, the method can be combined with other types of evidence, and we later integrate attribute names with the Gaussian embeddings to evaluate the method's contribution to improving overall performance. We compare Gem with several baseline methods for numeric only and numeric + context tasks, showing that Gem consistently outperforms the baselines on four benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of XML Compression Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XML simplifies data exchange among heterogeneous computers, but it is notoriously verbose and has spawned the development of many XML-specific compressors and binary formats. We present an XML test corpus and a combined efficiency metric integrating compression ratio and execution speed. We use this corpus and linear regression to assess 14 general-purpose and XML-specific compressors relative to the proposed metric. We also identify key factors when selecting a compressor. Our results show XMill or WBXML may be useful in some instances, but a general-purpose compressor is often the best choice.</description>

      <title>Grid-AR: A Grid-based Booster for Learned Cardinality Estimation and Range Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an advancement in cardinality estimation by augmenting autoregressive models with a traditional grid structure. The novel hybrid estimator addresses the limitations of autoregressive models by creating a smaller representation of continuous columns and by incorporating a batch execution for queries with range predicates, as opposed to an iterative sampling approach. The suggested modification markedly improves the execution time of the model for both training and prediction, reduces memory consumption, and does so with minimal decline in accuracy. We further present an algorithm that enables the estimator to calculate cardinality estimates for range join queries efficiently. To validate the effectiveness of our cardinality estimator, we conduct and present a comprehensive evaluation considering state-of-the-art competitors using three benchmark datasets -- demonstrating vast improvements in execution times and resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Learning Tree Pattern Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining why and how a tree $t$ structurally differs from another tree $t^*$ is a question that is encountered throughout computer science, including in understanding tree-structured data such as XML or JSON data. In this article, we explore how to learn explanations for structural differences between pairs of trees from sample data: suppose we are given a set $\{(t_1, t_1^*),\dots, (t_n, t_n^*)\}$ of pairs of labelled, ordered trees; is there a small set of rules that explains the structural differences between all pairs $(t_i, t_i^*)$? This raises two research questions: (i) what is a good notion of "rule" in this context?; and (ii) how can sets of rules explaining a data set be learnt algorithmically?
  We explore these questions from the perspective of database theory by (1) introducing a pattern-based specification language for tree transformations; (2) exploring the computational complexity of variants of the above algorithmic problem, e.g. showing NP-hardness for very restricted variants; and (3) discussing how to solve the problem for data from CS education research using SAT solvers.</description>

      <title>ITR: Grammar-based Graph Compression Supporting Fast Triple Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neighborhood queries and triple queries are the most common queries on graphs; thus, it is desirable to answer them efficiently on compressed data structures. We present a compression scheme called Incidence-Type-RePair (ITR) for graphs with labeled nodes and labeled edges based on RePair and apply the scheme to network, version, and RDF graphs. We show that ITR performs neighborhood queries and triple queries within only a few milliseconds and thereby outperforms existing RePair-based solutions on graphs while providing a compression size comparable to existing graph compressors.</description>

      <title>LLM-based SPARQL Query Generation from Natural Language over Federated Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for translating user questions into accurate federated SPARQL queries over bioinformatics knowledge graphs (KGs) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance accuracy and reduce hallucinations in query generation, our system utilises metadata from the KGs, including query examples and schema information, and incorporates a validation step to correct generated queries. The system is available online at chat.expasy.org.</description>
