      <title>High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). However, the interpretation of vesicle deformation under flow has been hindered by the absence of a suitable theoretical or computational framework. Here, we present a simulation-based model that describes GUV deformation in RT-DC, taking into account the surface dilational elastic modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area.
  Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the surface dilational modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric enzyme kinetics of F1-ATPase induced by rotation-assisted substrate binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate asymmetric enzyme kinetics of a biomolecular motor F1-ATPase between synthesis and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Our experiments show that ATP hydrolysis follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, but ATP synthesis, which is an F1-ATPase's primary biological role, deviates from it. Specifically, the synthesis rate is sustained even at low substrate concentrations. Analysis of a theoretical model consistent with the experimental results reveals that ATP synthesis implements a rotation-assisted mechanism, in which a limited binding rate at low substrate concentration is partially compensated for by rotation to an angle where the binding rate is high. The results may imply that F1-ATPase implements a regulatory mechanism of enhancing substrate binding for ATP synthesis.</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microplastics pose a growing threat to reef-building corals. Yet, understanding of their uptake and long-term incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited due to the invasive nature of existing methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we repurpose optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastics into microscopic lasers. These laser particles emit distinctive spectral signatures that enable in vivo tracking of microplastics and simultaneous local sensing, shedding light on internalization and transport of individual microplastic particles in live corals.</description>

      <title>Predicting mosquito flight behavior using Bayesian dynamical systems learning</title>

Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases cause several hundred thousand deaths every year. Deciphering mosquito host-seeking behavior is essential to prevent disease transmission through mosquito capture and surveillance. Despite recent substantial progress, we currently lack a comprehensive quantitative understanding of how visual and other sensory cues guide mosquitoes to their targets. Here, we combined 3D infrared tracking of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Bayesian dynamical systems inference to learn a quantitative biophysical model of mosquito host-seeking behavior. Trained on more than 20,000,000 data points from mosquito free-flight trajectories recorded in the presence of visual and carbon dioxide cues, the model accurately predicts how mosquitoes respond to human targets. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for optimizing mosquito capture and control strategies, a key step towards mitigating the impact of mosquito-borne diseases.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Interactive visualization of large molecular systems with VTX: example with a minimal whole-cell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: VTX is an open-source molecular visualization software designed to overcome the scaling limitations of existing real-time molecular visualization software when handling massive molecular datasets. VTX employs a meshless molecular graphics engine utilizing impostor-based techniques and adaptive level-of-detail (LOD) rendering. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and enables real-time visualization and manipulation of large molecular systems. Performance benchmarks against VMD, PyMOL, and ChimeraX using a 114-million-bead Martini minimal whole-cell model demonstrate VTX's efficiency, maintaining consistent frame rates even under interactive manipulation on standard computer hardware. VTX incorporates features such as screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for enhanced depth perception and free-fly navigation for intuitive exploration of large molecular systems. VTX is open-source and free for non commercial use. Binaries for Windows and Ubuntu Linux are available at http://vtx.drugdesign.fr. VTX source code is available at https://github.com/VTX-Molecular-Visualization.</description>
