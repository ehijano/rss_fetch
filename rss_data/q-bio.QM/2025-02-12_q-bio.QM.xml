      <title>A Simple yet Effective DDG Predictor is An Unsupervised Antibody Optimizer and Explainer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proteins that exist today have been optimized over billions of years of natural evolution, during which nature creates random mutations and selects them. The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the limited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the fitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to constrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness variants, among which the change in binding free energy (DDG) of protein complexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the huge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of DDG prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation preferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight DDG predictor (Light-DDG), which adopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by knowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy DDG predictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale dataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We find that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good unsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we propose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which accounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further explore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody optimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to identify desirable mutations.</description>

      <title>UniZyme: A Unified Protein Cleavage Site Predictor Enhanced with Enzyme Active-Site Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage is essential for many biological functions. Accurate prediction of cleavage sites can facilitate various applications such as drug development, enzyme design, and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, most existing models are restricted to an individual enzyme, which neglects shared knowledge of enzymes and fails generalize to novel enzymes. Thus, we introduce a unified protein cleavage site predictor named {\method}, which can generalize across diverse enzymes. To enhance the enzyme encoding for the protein cleavage site prediction, {\method} employs a novel biochemically-informed model architecture along with active-site knowledge of proteolytic enzymes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that {\method} achieves high accuracy in predicting cleavage sites across a range of proteolytic enzymes, including unseen enzymes. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniZyme-4A67.</description>

      <title>Supervised contrastive learning for cell stage classification of animal embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video microscopy, when combined with machine learning, offers a promising approach for studying the early development of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. However, manually annotating developmental events, and more specifically cell divisions, is time-consuming for a biologist and cannot scale up for practical applications. We aim to automatically classify the cell stages of embryos from 2D time-lapse microscopy videos with a deep learning approach. We focus on the analysis of bovine embryonic development using video microscopy, as we are primarily interested in the application of cattle breeding, and we have created a Bovine Embryos Cell Stages (ECS) dataset. The challenges are three-fold: (1) low-quality images and bovine dark cells that make the identification of cell stages difficult, (2) class ambiguity at the boundaries of developmental stages, and (3) imbalanced data distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce CLEmbryo, a novel method that leverages supervised contrastive learning combined with focal loss for training, and the lightweight 3D neural network CSN-50 as an encoder. We also show that our method generalizes well. CLEmbryo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both our Bovine ECS dataset and the publicly available NYU Mouse Embryos dataset.</description>

      <title>Measuring Fitness and Importance of Species in Food Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecosystems face intensifying threats from climate change, overexploitation, and other human pressures, emphasizing the urgent need to identify keystone species and vulnerable ones. While established network-based measures often rely on a single metric to quantify a species' relevance, they overlook how organisms can be both carbon providers and consumers, thus playing a dual role in food webs. Here, we introduce a novel approach that assigns each species two complementary scores -- an importance measure quantifying their centrality as carbon source and a fitness measure capturing their vulnerability. We show that species with high importance are more likely to trigger co-extinctions upon removal, while high-fitness species typically endure until later stages of collapse, in line with their broader prey ranges. On the other hand, low fitness species are the most vulnerable and susceptible to extinctions. Tested on multiple food webs, our method outperforms traditional degree-based analyses and competes effectively with eigenvector-based approaches, while also providing additional insights. Relying solely on interaction data, the approach is scalable and avoids reliance on expert-driven classifications, offering a cost-effective tool for prioritizing conservation efforts.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: A Comprehensive Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume of drug combinations in modern therapeutic regimens needs reliable methods for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, their potential in pharmaceutical research, particularly in DDI prediction, remains largely unexplored. This study thoroughly investigates LLMs' capabilities in predicting DDIs by uniquely processing molecular structures (SMILES), target organisms, and gene interaction data as raw text input from the latest DrugBank dataset. We evaluated 18 different LLMs, including proprietary models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) and open-source variants (from 1.5B to 72B parameters), first assessing their zero-shot capabilities in DDI prediction. We then fine-tuned selected models (GPT-4, Phi-3.5 2.7B, Qwen-2.5 3B, Gemma-2 9B, and Deepseek R1 distilled Qwen 1.5B) to optimize their performance. Our comprehensive evaluation framework included validation across 13 external DDI datasets, comparing against traditional approaches such as l2-regularized logistic regression. Fine-tuned LLMs demonstrated superior performance, with Phi-3.5 2.7B achieving a sensitivity of 0.978 in DDI prediction, with an accuracy of 0.919 on balanced datasets (50% positive, 50% negative cases). This result represents an improvement over both zero-shot predictions and state-of-the-art machine-learning methods used for DDI prediction. Our analysis reveals that LLMs can effectively capture complex molecular interaction patterns and cases where drug pairs target common genes, making them valuable tools for practical applications in pharmaceutical research and clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Fourier-enhanced Neural Networks For Systems Biology Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of systems biology, differential equations are commonly used to model biological systems, but solving them for large-scale and complex systems can be computationally expensive. Recently, the integration of machine learning and mathematical modeling has offered new opportunities for scientific discoveries in biology and health. The emerging physics-informed neural network (PINN) has been proposed as a solution to this problem. However, PINN can be computationally expensive and unreliable for complex biological systems. To address these issues, we propose the Fourier-enhanced Neural Networks for systems biology (SB-FNN). SB-FNN uses an embedded Fourier neural network with an adaptive activation function and a cyclic penalty function to optimize the prediction of biological dynamics, particularly for biological systems that exhibit oscillatory patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that SB-FNN achieves better performance and is more efficient than PINN for handling complex biological models. Experimental results on cellular and population models demonstrate that SB-FNN outperforms PINN in both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising alternative approach for handling complex biological models. The proposed method achieved better performance on six biological models and is expected to replace PINN as the most advanced method in systems biology.</description>

      <title>Generation of Drug-Induced Cardiac Reactions towards Virtual Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are pivotal in cardiac drug development, yet they often fail due to inadequate efficacy and unexpected safety issues, leading to significant financial losses. Using in-silico trials to replace a part of physical clinical trials, e.g., leveraging advanced generative models to generate drug-influenced electrocardiograms (ECGs), seems an effective method to reduce financial risk and potential harm to trial participants. While existing generative models have demonstrated progress in ECG generation, they fall short in modeling drug reactions due to limited fidelity and inability to capture individualized drug response patterns. In this paper, we propose a Drug-Aware Diffusion Model (DADM), which could simulate individualized drug reactions while ensuring fidelity. To ensure fidelity, we construct a set of ordinary differential equations to provide external physical knowledge (EPK) of the realistic ECG morphology. The EPK is used to adaptively constrain the morphology of the generated ECGs through a dynamic cross-attention (DCA) mechanism. Furthermore, we propose an extension of ControlNet to incorporate demographic and drug data, simulating individual drug reactions. We compare DADM with the other eight state-of-the-art ECG generative models on two real-world databases covering 8 types of drug regimens. The results demonstrate that DADM can more accurately simulate drug-induced changes in ECGs, improving the accuracy by at least 5.79% and recall by 8%.</description>

      <title>ADEPT: A Noninvasive Method for Determining Elastic Parameters of Valve Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer simulation of "virtual interventions" may inform optimal valve repair for a given patient prior to intervention. However, the paucity of noninvasive methods to determine in vivo mechanical parameters of valves limits the accuracy of computer prediction and their clinical application. To address this, we propose ADEPT: A noninvasive method for Determining Elastic Parameters of valve Tissue. In this work, we demonstrated its application to the tricuspid valve of a child. We first tracked valve displacements from open to closed frames within a 3D echocardiogram time sequence using image registration. Physics-informed neural networks were subsequently applied to estimate the nonlinear mechanical properties from first principles and reference displacements. The simulated model using these patient-specific parameters closely aligned with the reference image segmentation, achieving a mean symmetric distance of less than 1 mm. Our approach doubled the accuracy of the simulated model compared to the generic parameters reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Interpreting artificial neural networks to detect genome-wide association signals for complex traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the genetic architecture of complex diseases is challenging due to the multifactorial and interactive landscape of genomic and environmental influences. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants for multiple complex traits, conventional statistical approaches can be limited by simplified assumptions such as linearity and lack of epistasis in models. In this work, we trained artificial neural networks to predict complex traits using both simulated and real genotype-phenotype datasets. We extracted feature importance scores via different post hoc interpretability methods to identify potentially associated loci (PAL) for the target phenotype and devised an approach for obtaining p-values for the detected PAL. Simulations with various parameters demonstrated that associated loci can be detected with good precision using strict selection criteria. By applying our approach to the schizophrenia cohort in the Estonian Biobank, we detected multiple loci associated with this highly polygenic and heritable disorder. There was significant concordance between PAL and loci previously associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with enrichment analyses of genes within the identified PAL predominantly highlighting terms related to brain morphology and function. With advancements in model optimization and uncertainty quantification, artificial neural networks have the potential to enhance the identification of genomic loci associated with complex diseases, offering a more comprehensive approach for GWAS and serving as initial screening tools for subsequent functional studies.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals indicates signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods), but its effects on background (non-ictal) brain dynamics remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed an in-house dataset of brain activity recordings from epileptic zebrafish, focusing on two controlled genetic conditions across two fishlines. After using machine learning to segment and label recordings, we applied time-delay embedding and Persistent Homology -- a noise-robust method from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- to uncover topological patterns in brain activity. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished based on the topology of their dynamics, independent of genetic condition or fishline, which validates our approach. Remarkably, within a single wild-type fishline, we identified topological differences in non-ictal periods between seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. These findings suggest that epilepsy leaves detectable topological signatures in brain dynamics even outside of ictal periods. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of TDA as a quantitative framework to screen for topological markers of epileptic susceptibility, with potential applications across species.</description>
