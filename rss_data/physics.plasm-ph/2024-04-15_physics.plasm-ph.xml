      <title>A fully implicit, asymptotic-preserving, semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the time dependent anisotropic heat transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the operator-split asymptotic-preserving, semi-Lagrangian algorithm for time dependent anisotropic heat transport equation proposed in [Chac\'on et al., JCP, 272, 719-746, 2014] to use a fully implicit time integration with backward differentiation formulas. The proposed implicit method can deal with arbitrary heat-transport anisotropy ratios \chi_{\parallel}/\chi_{\perp}\ggg1 (with \chi_{\parallel}, \chi_{\perp} the parallel and perpendicular heat diffusivities, respectively) in complicated magnetic field topologies in an accurate and efficient manner. The implicit algorithm is second-order accurate temporally, has favorable positivity preservation properties, and demonstrates an accurate treatment at boundary layers (e.g., island separatrices), which was not ensured by the operator-split implementation. The condition number of the resulting algebraic system is independent of the anisotropy ratio, and is inverted with preconditioned GMRES. We propose a simple preconditioner that renders the linear system compact, resulting in mesh-independent convergence rates for topologically simple magnetic fields, and convergence rates scaling as \sim(N\Delta t)^{1/4} (with N the total mesh size and \Delta t the timestep) in topologically complex magnetic-field configurations. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the approach with test problems of varying complexity, including an analytically tractable boundary-layer problem in a straight magnetic field, and a topologically complex magnetic field featuring magnetic islands with extreme anisotropy ratios (\chi_{\parallel}/\chi_{\perp}=10^{10}).</description>

      <title>Laser-stimulated photodetachment of electrons from the negatively charged dielectric substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown experimentally that the photodetachment yield of surplus electrons created by plasma-induced charging of non-conductive surfaces of dielectric materials depends on the initial surface charge density and do not correlate with the tabulated affinity values of these materials. This unexpected result obtained using laser-stimulated photodetachment for fused silica, boron nitride, and alumina, is critically important for the understanding of charging and discharging dynamics, secondary electron emission, and photoemission effects affecting plasma-wall interactions relevant to surface and capacitively coupled discharges, dusty plasmas, electrostatic probe diagnostics and applications for plasma processing of materials, plasma propulsion and gas breakdown.</description>

      <title>Establishing Criteria for the Transition from Kinetic to Fluid Modeling in Hollow Cathode Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct 2D3V Particle-In-Cell simulations of hollow cathodes, encompassing both the channel and plume region, with an emphasis on plasma switch applications. The plasma in the hollow cathode channel can exhibit kinetic effects depending on how fast electrons emitted from the insert are thermalized via Coulomb collisions. The criterion that determines whether the plasma operates in a Duid or kinetic regime is given as follows. When Coulomb collisions occur at a much greater rate than ionization or excitation events, the Electron Energy Distribution Function relaxes to aMaxwellian distribution and the plasmawithin the channel can be describedwith aDuidmodel. In contrast, if inelastic processes are much faster, then the Electron Energy Distribution Function in the channel exhibits a notable high-energy tail, and a kinetic treatment is required. This criterion is applied to other kinds of hollow cathodes from the literature, revealing that a Duid approach is suitable for most electric propulsion applications, whereas a kinetic treatment might be necessary for plasma switches. Additionally, amomentumbalance reveals that a diffusion equation is sufAcient to predict the plasma plume expansion, a crucial input in the design of hollow cathodes for plasma switch applications.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Method for Solving Non-quasi-neutral Hybrid-PIC Model of Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid model of particle-ion-fluid-electron is widely utilized in astrophysical and laser-produced plasmas due to its kinetic characteristics and remarkable computational efficiency. However, the current numerical methods for the hybrid model have limitations when it comes to simulating non-quasi-neutral plasmas. To address this issue, I proposed a novel method called Convolutional Hybrid PIC (conv-HPIC). The conv-HPIC is based on a convolution equation derived from the Poisson's equation and the generalized Ohm's law. I performed numerical simulations on the collisionless electrostatic shock to validate the effectiveness of this method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately describe and predict the behavior of non-quasi-neutral plasmas. This method can be applied to both stationary and non-stationary electrostatic issues. It avoids the need for iterative calculations, effectively suppresses numerical noise, exhibits good computational efficiency, and can be easily parallelized.</description>

      <title>Inertial range of magnetorotational turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks around compact stars are formed due to turbulence driven by magnetorotational instability. Despite over thirty years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range -- where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection -- have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow-magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfv\'enic fluctuations, possessing twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field. Our results provide important implications for interpreting the radio observations by the Event Horizon Telescope.</description>

      <title>The effects of finite electron inertia on helicity-barrier-mediated turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the partitioning of turbulent energy between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for the accurate interpretation of observations and modelling of various astrophysical phenomena. Many such plasmas are "imbalanced", wherein the large-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating in a single direction. In this paper, we demonstrate that when strongly-magnetised plasma turbulence is imbalanced, nonlinear conservation laws imply the existence of a critical value of the electron plasma beta that separates two dramatically different types of turbulence in parameter space. For betas below the critical value, the free energy injected on the largest scales is able to undergo a familiar Kolmogorov-type cascade to small scales where it is dissipated, heating electrons. For betas above the critical value, the system forms a "helicity barrier" that prevents the cascade from proceeding past the ion Larmor radius, causing the majority of the injected free energy to be deposited into ion heating. Physically, the helicity barrier results from the inability of the system to adjust to the disparity between the perpendicular-wavenumber scalings of the free energy and generalised helicity below the ion Larmor radius; restoring finite electron inertia can annul, or even reverse, this disparity, giving rise to the aforementioned critical beta. We relate this physics to the "dynamic phase alignment" mechanism, and characterise various other important features of the helicity barrier, including the nature of the nonlinear wavenumber-space fluxes, dissipation rates, and energy spectra. The existence of such a critical beta has important implications for heating, as it suggests that the dominant recipient of the turbulent energy -- ions or electrons -- can depend sensitively on the characteristics of the plasma at large scales.</description>

      <title>Electric potential during tokamak disruptions and steady-state current drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Helmholtz decomposition separates the electric field in a plasma into the sum of a divergence-free, $\vec{E}_B$, and a curl-free, $\vec{E}_q$, part. The uniqueness of the separation can be shown using the time dependence of the magnetic helicity, which also shows there is a steady-state loop voltage $V_{ss}$, when the electric potential is not constant on the chamber walls. The divergence-free part of $\vec{E}$ determines the evolution of the magnetic field. The curl-free part enforces quasi-neutrality, $\vec{E}_q=-\vec{\nabla}\Phi_q$. The quasi-neutrality potential is approximated by $T_e/e$, the electron temperature divided by the elementary charge. During tokamak disruptions, the magnetic surfaces are broken creating large regions of chaotic magnetic field lines. In each chaotic region, the parallel current density divided by $B$ relaxes toward a spatial constant by shear Alfv\'en waves. The potential $\Phi_q$ produces both a diffusion coefficient that is Bohm-like, $D_q\approx T_e/eB$, and a large scale flow $\approx T_e/eB a_T$ across the magnetic field lines, where $a_T$ is the scale of the large scale difference in temperature. This diffusion and flow are important for sweeping impurities into the core of a disrupting tokamak plasma.</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>

      <title>Expulsion of runaway electrons using ECRH in the TCV tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electrons (REs) are a concern for tokamak fusion reactors from discharge startup to termination. A sudden localized loss of a multi-megaampere RE beam can inflict severe damage to the first wall. Should a disruption occur, the existence of a RE seed may play a significant role in the formation of a RE beam and the magnitude of its current. The application of central electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) in the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) reduces an existing RE seed population by up to three orders of magnitude within only a few hundred milliseconds. Applying ECRH can also prevent the formation of a post-disruption RE beam where it would otherwise be expected. The RE expulsion rate and consequent RE current reduction are found to increase with applied ECRH power. Whereas central ECRH is effective in expelling REs, off-axis ECRH has a comparatively limited effect. A simple 0-D model for the evolution of the RE population is presented that explains the effective ECRH-induced RE expulsion results from the combined effects of increased electron temperature and enhanced RE transport.</description>

      <title>Influence of the density gradient on turbulent heat transport at ion-scales: an inter-machine study with the gyrokinetic code stella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient control of turbulent heat transport is crucial for magnetic confinement fusion reactors. This work discusses the complex interplay between density gradients and micro-instabilities, shedding light on their impact on turbulent heat transport in different fusion devices. In particular, the influence of density gradients on turbulent heat transport is investigated through an extensive inter-machine study, including various stellarators such as W7-X, LHD, TJ-II and NCSX, along with the Asdex-Upgrade tokamak and the tokamak geometry of the Cyclone Base Case (CBC). Linear and nonlinear simulations are performed employing the $\delta$f-gyrokinetic code stella across a wide range of parameters to explore the effects of density gradients, temperature gradients, and kinetic electrons. A strong reduction in ion heat flux with increasing density gradients is found in NCSX and W7-X due to the stabilization of temperature-gradient-driven modes without significantly destabilizing density-gradient-driven modes. In contrast, the tokamaks exhibit an increase in ion heat flux with density gradients. Notably, the behavior of ion heat fluxes in stellarators does not align with that of linear growth rates. Additionally, this study provides physical insights into the micro-instabilities, emphasizing the dominance of trapped-electron-modes in CBC, AUG, TJ-II, LHD and NCSX, while both the trapped-electron-mode and the passing-particle-driven universal instability contribute significantly in W7-X.</description>

      <title>Plasma Dynamics and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in 3D Nonrelativistic Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding plasma dynamics and nonthermal particle acceleration in 3D magnetic reconnection has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we explore these problems by performing large-scale fully kinetic simulations of multi-xline plasmoid reconnection with various parameters in both the weak and strong guide field regimes. In each regime, we have identified its unique 3D dynamics that leads to field-line chaos and efficient acceleration, and we have achieved nonthermal acceleration of both electrons and protons into power-law spectra. The spectral indices agree well with a simple Fermi acceleration theory that includes guide field dependence. In the low-guide-field regime, the flux-rope kink instability governs the 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. The weak dependence of the spectra on the ion-to-electron mass ratio and $\beta$ ($\ll1$) implies that the particles are sufficiently magnetized for Fermi acceleration in our simulations. While both electrons and protons are injected at reconnection exhausts, protons are primarily injected by perpendicular electric fields through Fermi reflections and electrons are injected by a combination of perpendicular and parallel electric fields. The magnetic power spectra agree with in-situ magnetotail observations, and the spectral index may reflect a reconnection-driven size distribution of plasmoids instead of Goldreich-Sridhar vortex cascade. As the guide field becomes stronger, the oblique flux ropes of large sizes capture the main 3D dynamics for efficient acceleration. Intriguingly, the oblique flux ropes can also run into flux-rope kink instability to drive extra 3D dynamics. This work has broad implications for 3D reconnection dynamics and particle acceleration in heliophysics and astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: For the first time, we demonstrate the application of an inverse Compton scattering X-ray Source, driven by a laser-plasma accelerator, to image an additively manufactured component. X-rays with a mean energy of 380 keV were produced and used to image an additively manufactured part made of an Inconel (Nickel 718) alloy. Because inverse Compton scattering driven by laser-plasma acceleration produces high-energy X-rays while maintaining a focal spot size on the order of a micron, the source can provide several benefits over conventional X-ray production methods, particularly when imaging superalloy parts, with the potential to revolutionise what can be inspected.</description>

      <title>Plasma kinetics: Discrete Boltzmann modelling and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete Boltzmann model (DBM) for plasma kinetics is proposed. The constructing of DBM mainly considers two aspects. The first is to build a physical model with sufficient physical functions before simulation. The second is to present schemes for extracting more valuable information from massive data after simulation. For the first aspect, the model is equivalent to a magnetohydrodynamic model plus a coarse-grained model for the most relevant TNE behaviors including the entropy production rate. A number of typical benchmark problems including Orszag-Tang (OT) vortex problem are used to verify the physical functions of DBM. For the second aspect, the DBM use non-conserved kinetic moments of (f-feq) to describe non-equilibrium state and behaviours of complex system. The OT vortex problem and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) are practical applications of the second aspect. For RMI with interface inverse and re-shock process, it is found that, in the case without magnetic field, the non-organized momentum flux shows the most pronounced effects near shock front, while the non-organized energy flux shows the most pronounced behaviors near perturbed interface. The influence of magnetic field on TNE effects shows stages: before the interface inverse, the TNE strength is enhanced by reducing the interface inverse speed; while after the interface inverse, the TNE strength is significantly reduced. Both the global average TNE strength and entropy production rate contributed by non-organized energy flux can be used as physical criteria to identify whether or not the magnetic field is sufficient to prevent the interface inverse.</description>

      <title>Energetic Particle Tracing in Optimized Quasisymmetric Stellarator Equilibria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the design of magnetic confinement fusion devices have allowed the construction of exceptionally optimized stellarator configurations. The near-axis expansion in particular has proven to enable the construction of magnetic configurations with good confinement properties while taking only a fraction of the usual computation time to generate optimized magnetic equilibria. However, not much is known about the overall features of fast-particle orbits computed in such analytical, yet simplified, equilibria when compared to those originating from accurate equilibrium solutions. This work aims to assess and demonstrate the potential of the near-axis expansion to provide accurate information on particle orbits and to compute loss fractions in moderate to high aspect ratios. The configurations used here are all scaled to fusion-relevant parameters and approximate quasisymmetry in various degrees. This allows us to understand how deviations from quasisymmetry affect particle orbits and what are their effects on the estimation of the loss fraction. Guiding-center trajectories of fusion-born alpha particles are traced using gyronimo and SIMPLE codes under the NEAT framework, showing good numerical agreement. Discrepancies between near-axis and MHD fields have minor effects on passing particles but significant effects on trapped particles, especially in quasihelically symmetric magnetic fields. Effective expressions were found for estimating orbit widths and passing-trapped separatrix in quasisymmetric near-axis fields. Loss fractions agree in the prompt losses regime but diverge afterward.</description>

      <title>Joule-Class Pulsed THz Sources from Microchannel Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference of joule-class THz radiation sources from microchannel targets driven with hundreds of joule, picosecond lasers is reported. THz sources of this magnitude are useful for nonlinear pumping of matter and for charged-particle acceleration and manipulation. Microchannel targets demonstrate increased laser-THz conversion efficiency compared to planar foil targets, with laser energy to THz energy conversion up to approximately 0.9% in the best cases.</description>

Abstract: The lack of experimental data on the direct-drive pressure leads us to the conclusion that, the published experimental confirmation of driving pressure boosting and smoothing for hybrid-drive inertial fusion is not credible.</description>

      <title>Stochastic density functional theory combined with Langevin dynamics for warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study overviews and extends a recently developed stochastic finite-temperature Kohn-Sham density functional theory to study warm dense matter using Langevin dynamics, specifically under periodic boundary conditions. The method's algorithmic complexity exhibits nearly linear scaling with system size and is inversely proportional to the temperature. Additionally, a novel linear-scaling stochastic approach is introduced to assess the Kubo-Greenwood conductivity, demonstrating exceptional stability for DC conductivity. Utilizing the developed tools, we investigate the equation of state, radial distribution, and electronic conductivity of Hydrogen at a temperature of 30,000K. As for the radial distribution functions, we reveal a transition of Hydrogen from gas-like to liquid-like behavior as its density exceeds $4 g/cm^3$. As for the electronic conductivity as a function of the density, we identified a remarkable isosbestic point at frequencies around 7eV, which may be an additional signature of a gas-liquid transition in Hydrogen at 30,000K.</description>
