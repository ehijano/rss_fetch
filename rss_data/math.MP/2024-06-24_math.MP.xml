      <title>Effective quantum dynamics for magnetic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to derive an effective nonlinear dynamics, described by the Hartree-Fock equations, for fermionic quantum particles confined to a two-dimensional box and in presence of an external, uniform magnetic field. The derivation invokes the Dirac-Frenkel principle. We discuss the validity of this effective description with respect to the many-body Schr\"odinger dynamics for small times and for weak interactions, and also in regards to the number of particles.</description>

      <title>Exact loop densities in $O(1)$ dense loop model on the cylinder of odd circumference and clusters in half-turn self-dual critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $O(1)$ dense loop model in a square lattice wrapped on a cylinder of odd circumference $L$ and calculate the exact densities of loops. These densities of loops are equal to the densities of critical bond percolation clusters on a forty-five-degree rotated square lattice rolled into a cylinder with special boundary conditions which we refer to as half-turn self-dual percolation. The solution is based on a correspondence between the $O(1)$ dense loop model and the six-vertex model at the Razumov-Stroganov point.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusive concentration for the chemical distance in Bernoulli percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering supercritical Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, Garet and Marchand [GM09] proved a diffusive concentration for the graph distance. In this paper, we sharpen this result by establishing the subdiffusive concentration inequality, which revisits the sublinear bound of the variance proved by Dembin [Dem22] as a consequence. Our approach is inspired by similar work in First-passage percolation [BR08, DHS14], combined with new tools to address the challenge posed by the infinite weight of the model. These tools, including the notion of effective radius and its properties, enable a simple one-step renormalization process as a systematic means of managing the effects of resampling edges.</description>

      <title>Replica bound for Ising spin glass models in one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpolation method is a powerful tool for rigorous analysis of mean-field spin glass models, both with and without dilution. In this study, we show that the interpolation method can be applied to Ising spin glass models in one dimension, such as a one-dimensional chain and a two-leg ladder. In one dimension, the replica symmetric (RS) cavity method is naturally expected to be rigorous for Ising spin glass models. Using the interpolation method, we rigorously prove that the RS cavity method provides lower bounds on the quenched free energies of Ising spin glass models in one dimension at any finite temperature in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

Abstract: After recasting the standard charged and uncharged brane profiles in the harmonic gauge, we explore solutions with the same isometries where the potentials $V = T \,e^{\gamma\,\phi}$ of ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings are taken into account. Combining a detailed catalog of the possible asymptotics with some numerical results suggests that these spherically symmetric backgrounds terminate at singularities within finite proper distances.</description>

      <title>Thermal activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory, which emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled, possesses eight types of relativistic particles whose mass spectrum and scattering matrices are organized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ algebra. It is predicted that all odd-parity particles are dark and cannot be directly excited from the ground state. This makes these dark particles hard to be detected. Here, we study the local dynamical spin structure factor of the model at low-frequencies and low-temperatures. In contrast to the invisibility of the dark particles in THz spectroscopy or inelastic neutron scattering measurement, we find that the lightest dark particle is detectable, manifested as a thermal activation gap in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Gepner's pioneering work, the requirement that leads to a model having the desired $N=1$ Spacetime supersymmetry and $E(8)\times E(6)$ Gauge symmetry was the requirement that the spacetime symmetry is compatible with modular invariance. In this work we show that the requirement for the simultaneous fulfillment of mutual locality of the left-moving vertices of physical states with the space-time symmetry generators and of right-moving vertices with generators of $E(8)\times E(6)$-gauge symmetry, which arises after some special reduction together with the requirement of mutual locality of complete (left-right) vertices of physical states among themselves leads to the same Gepner models.</description>

      <title>The incipient infinite cluster of the FK-Ising model in dimensions $d\geq 3$ and the susceptibility of the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical FK-Ising measure $\phi_{\beta_c}$ on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$. We construct the measure $\phi^\infty:=\lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty}\phi_{\beta_c}[\:\cdot\: |\: 0\leftrightarrow x]$ and prove it satisfies $\phi^\infty[0\leftrightarrow \infty]=1$. This corresponds to the natural candidate for the incipient infinite cluster measure of the FK-Ising model. Our proof uses a result of Lupu and Werner (Electron. Commun. Probab., 2016) that relates the FK-Ising model to the random current representation of the Ising model, together with a mixing property of random currents recently established by Aizenman and Duminil-Copin (Ann. Math., 2021). We then study the susceptibility $\chi(\beta)$ of the nearest-neighbour Ising model on $\mathbb Z^d$. When $d&gt;4$, we improve a previous result of Aizenman (Comm. Math. Phys., 1982) to obtain the existence of $A&gt;0$ such that, for $\beta&lt;\beta_c$, \begin{equation*}
  \chi(\beta)= \frac{A}{1-\beta/\beta_c}(1+o(1)), \end{equation*} where $o(1)$ tends to $0$ as $\beta$ tends to $\beta_c$. Additionally, we relate the constant $A$ to the incipient infinite cluster of the double random current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An involutive Lie bialgebra induces a Batalin-Vilkovisky operator on its exterior algebra. We introduce a graded generalization of the necklace Lie bialgebra, which depends on a choice of a quiver $Q$. We relate the resulting Batalin-Vilkovisky structure to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure coming from a degree $-1$ symplectic form on a suitably defined representation variety of the quiver $Q$. The morphism intertwining these Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras will be given by a twisted trace, recovering the usual (super)trace and the odd trace.</description>

      <title>A quantization of moduli spaces of 3-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a quantization of the moduli space $\mathcal{GH}_\Lambda(S\times\mathbb{R})$ of maximal globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metrics on $S\times \mathbb{R}$ with constant sectional curvature $\Lambda$, for a punctured surface $S$. Although this moduli space is known to be symplectomorphic to the cotangent bundle of the Teichm\"uller space of $S$ independently of the value of $\Lambda$, we define geometrically natural classes of observables leading to $\Lambda$-dependent quantizations. Using special coordinate systems, we first view $\mathcal{GH}_\Lambda(S\times\mathbb{R})$ as the set of points of a cluster $\mathscr{X}$-variety valued in the ring of generalized complex numbers $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda = \mathbb{R}[\ell]/(\ell^2+\Lambda)$. We then develop an $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda$-version of the quantum theory for cluster $\mathscr{X}$-varieties by establishing $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda$-versions of the quantum dilogarithm function. As a consequence, we obtain three families of projective unitary representations of the mapping class group of $S$. For $\Lambda &lt;0$ these representations recover those of Fock and Goncharov, while for $\Lambda\geq 0$ the representations are new.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entropy Evolution in Stochastic and Delayed Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the behaviour of the Gibbs' and conditional entropies in deterministic and stochastic systems and continue to a formulation appropriate for a stochastically perturbed system with delayed dynamics. The underlying question driving these investigations: ``Is the origin of the universally observed unidirectionality of time in our universe connected to the behaviour of entropy?''
  We focus on temporal entropic behaviour with a review of previous results in deterministic and stochastic systems. Our emphasis is on the temporal behaviour of the Gibbs' and conditional entropies as these entropies give equilibrium results in concordance with experimental findings. In invertible deterministic systems both entropies are temporally constant as has been well known for decades. The addition of stochastic perturbations (a Wiener process) leads to an indeterminate (either increasing or decreasing) behaviour of the Gibbs' entropy, but the conditional entropy monotonically approaches equilibrium with increasing time. The presence of delays in the dynamics, whether stochastically perturbed or not, leads to situations in which the Gibbs' and conditional entropies evolution can be oscillatory and not monotone, and may not approach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum KMS states on spin lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum KMS conditions within the context of spin lattice systems. Specifically, we define a strict deformation quantization (SDQ) for a $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued spin lattice system over $\mathbb{Z}^d$ generalizing the renown Berezin SDQ for a single sphere. This allows to promote a classical dynamics on the algebra of classical observables to a quantum dynamics on the algebra of quantum observables. We then compare the notion of classical and quantum thermal equilibrium by showing that any weak*-limit point of a sequence of quantum KMS states fulfils the classical KMS condition. In short, this proves that the semiclassical limit of quantum thermal states describes classical thermal equilibrium, strenghtening the physical interpretation of the classical KMS condition. Finally we provide two sufficient conditions ensuring uniqueness of classical and quantum KMS states: The latter are based on an version of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations adapted to the system of interest. As a consequence we identify a mild condition which ensures uniqueness of classical KMS states and of quantum KMS states for the quantized dynamics for a common sufficiently high temperature.</description>

      <title>Internal modes and radiation damping for quadratic Klein-Gordon in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Klein-Gordon equations with an external potential $V$ and a quadratic nonlinearity in $3+1$ space dimensions. We assume that $V$ is regular and decaying and that the (massive) Schr\"odinger operator $H=-\Delta+V+m^2$ has a positive eigenvalue $\lambda^2&lt;m^2$ with associated eigenfunction $\phi.$ This is a so-called internal mode and gives rise to time-periodic and spatially localized solutions of the linear flow. We address the classical question of whether such solutions persist under the full nonlinear flow, and describe the behavior of all solutions in a suitable neighborhood of zero. Provided a natural Fermi-Golden rule holds, our main result shows that a solution to the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation can be decomposed into a discrete component $a(t)\phi$ where $a(t)$ decays over time, and a continuous component $v$ which has some weak dispersive properties. We obtain precise asymptotic information on these components such as the sharp rates of decay $\vert a(t) \vert \approx t^{-1/2}$ and ${\| v(t) \|}_{L^\infty_x} \approx t^{-1}$, (where the implicit constants are independent of the small size of the data) as well as the growth of a natural weighted norm of the profile of $v.$ In particular, our result extends the seminal work of Soffer-Weinstein for the cubic Klein-Gordon, and shows that radiation damping also occurs in the quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Effective diffusivities in periodic KPZ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the KPZ equation on a torus with a $1+1$ spacetime white noise, it was shown in \cite{GK21,ADYGTK22} that the height function satisfies a central limit theorem, and the variance can be written as the expectation of an exponential functional of Brownian bridges. In this paper, we consider another physically relevant quantity, the winding number of the directed polymer on a cylinder, or equivalently, the displacement of the directed polymer endpoint in a spatially periodic random environment. It was shown in \cite{YGTK22} that the polymer endpoint satisfies a central limit theorem on diffusive scales. The main result of this paper is an explicit expression of the effective diffusivity, in terms of the expectation of another exponential functional of Brownian bridges. Our argument is based on a combination of tools from Malliavin calculus, homogenization, and diffusion in distribution-valued random environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the method of smoothed asymptotics developed by Terence Tao, we introduce a new ultra-violet regularisation scheme for loop integrals in quantum field theory which we call $\eta$ regularisation. This allows us to reveal a surprising connection between the elimination of divergences in divergent series of powers and the preservation of gauge invariance in the regularisation of loop integrals in quantum field theory. In particular, we note that a method for regularising the series of natural numbers so that it converges to minus one twelfth inspires a regularisation scheme for non-abelian gauge theories coupled to Dirac fermions that preserves the Ward identity for the vacuum polarisation tensor. We also comment on a possible connection to Schwinger proper time integrals.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for representing Gaussian fermionic states, pivotal in quantum spin systems and fermionic models, within a range of alternative quantum bases. We focus on transitioning these states from the conventional computational (\sigma^z) basis to more complex bases, such as ((\phi, \frac{\pi}{2}, \alpha)), which are essential for accurately calculating critical quantities like formation probabilities and Shannon entropy. We present a novel algorithm that not only simplifies the basis transformation but also reduces computational complexity, making it feasible to calculate amplitudes of large systems efficiently. Our key contribution is a technique that translates amplitude calculations into the Pfaffian computation of submatrices from an antisymmetric matrix, a process facilitated by understanding domain wall relationships across different bases. As an application, we will determine the formation probabilities for various bases and configurations within the critical transverse field Ising chain, considering both periodic and open boundary conditions. We aim to categorize the configurations and bases by examining the universal constant term that characterizes the scaling of the logarithm of the formation probability in the periodic system, as well as the coefficient of the logarithmic term in the case of open systems. In the open system scenario, this coefficient is influenced by the central charge and the conformal weight of the boundary condition-changing operator. This work is set to expand the toolkit available for researchers in quantum information theory and many-body physics, providing a more efficient and elegant solution for exploring Gaussian fermionic states in non-standard quantum bases.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Positivity and entanglement of polynomial Gaussian integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positivity preservation is an important issue in the dynamics of open quantum systems: positivity violations always mark the border of validity of the model. We investigate the positivity of self-adjoint polynomial Gaussian integral operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$, that is, the multivariable kernel $\kappa_{PG}$ is a product of a polynomial $P$ and a Gaussian kernel $\kappa_G$. These operators frequently appear in open quantum systems.
  We show that $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ can be only positive if the Gaussian part is positive, which yields a strong and quite easy test for positivity. This has an important corollary for the bipartite entanglement of the density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$: if the Gaussian density operator $\widehat{\kappa}_G$ fails the Peres-Horodecki criterion, then the corresponding polynomial Gaussian density operators $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG}$ also fail the criterion for all $P$, hence they are all entangled.
  We prove that polynomial Gaussian operators with polynomials of odd degree cannot be positive semidefinite.
  We introduce a new preorder $\preceq$ on Gaussian kernels such that if $\kappa_{G_0}\preceq \kappa_{G_1}$ then $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_0}\geq 0$ implies $\widehat{\kappa}_{PG_1}\geq 0$ for all polynomials $P$. Therefore, deciding the positivity of a polynomial Gaussian operator determines the positivity of a lot of another polynomial Gaussian operators having the same polynomial factor, which might improve any given positivity test by carrying it out on a much larger set of operators. We will show an example that this really can make positivity tests much more sensitive and efficient. This preorder has implication for the entanglement problem, too.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of the Plaquette Random-Cluster Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the $i$-dimensional plaqutte random-cluster model with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is dual to a $(d-i)$-dimensional plaquette random cluster model. In addition, we explore boundary conditions, infinite volume limits, and uniqueness for these models. For previously known results, we provide new proofs that rely more on the tools of algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>A fully observer-covariant formulation of the fluid dynamics of simple fluids: derivation, simple examples and a generalized Orr-Sommerfeld equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formalism to describe the motion of a fluid that is fully covariant with respect to arbitrary observers. To achieve full covariance, we write prognostic equations for quantities that belong to the graded exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle of the manifold occupied by the fluid. With the new formalism, we consider problems of stability, and we derive a generalization of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation that describes the evolution of perturbations relative to an arbitrary observer. The latter is applied to cases where the observer is the Lagrangian observer comoving with the background flow.</description>
