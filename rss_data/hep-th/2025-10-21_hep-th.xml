      <title>One-loop Corrected Holographic Shear Viscosity to Entropy Density Ratio at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-extremal black holes are known to contain strong quantum fluctuations in their near-horizon near-AdS$_2$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian modes. These fluctuations lead to one-loop corrections in the gravitational path integral that are essential in understanding the thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes at low temperatures where they become more dominant that the semi-classical answer. We explore the implications of these quantum fluctuations for near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ black branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We note that at one-loop level there is a coupling of the shear gravitational fluctuations to one of the would-be zero modes. This coupling affects the retarded Green's function in a way that leads to a low temperature violation of the shear viscosity to entropy density bound.</description>

      <title>Strings near BTZ black holes: A Carrollian Chronicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BTZ black hole provides a tractable (2+1)-dimensional example for investigating string dynamics in curved spacetime. However, a systematic and robust analysis of the solution space of strings in the near-horizon region of BTZ black holes remains elusive in the literature. This work aims to fill this gap by employing the string-Carroll expansion. This formalism provides a natural setting for working with the near-horizon region, because near-horizon expansions for non-extremal black holes match string-Carroll expansions. Using this formalism, and expanding the string action and pullback fields in powers of an effective speed of light, we study the dynamics of closed bosonic strings in the near-horizon, non-extremal BTZ spacetime. Our approach classifies the general characteristics and further reveals some novel features of the families of string solutions.</description>

      <title>Phases of Supersymmetric Ground States in $AdS_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the phase diagram of supersymmetric ground states in AdS$_4\times S^7$ supergravity. BPS black holes exist only when the conserved charges satisfy a certain non-linear constraint. For other charge sectors, we propose two component configurations comprised of a core black hole that carries macroscopic entropy, and a gas that carries a macroscopic fraction of the charge. The superconformal index counts ground states only modulo a linear constraint on the charges. Each index line includes a pure BPS black hole but we find that, when differences between R-charge exceed a certain threshold, the index is dominated by a two component configuration. We illuminate this result by studying the gravitational path integral in Euclidean signature, as function of supersymmetric boundary conditions. We find that a pure BPS black hole saddle dominates the index when the R-charges are comparable, but not when they differ sufficiently. The region where the Euclidean path integral becomes unstable is precisely where two component configurations dominate the index. We show that the KSW criteria are insensitive to this instability.</description>

      <title>Five W-boson amplitude = near-null decagon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a five-leg scattering amplitude on the special Coulomb branch of planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We reach this point of the moduli space of scalar vacuum expectation values by considering six-dimensional N=(1,1) super Yang-Mills theory and reducing it down to four space-time dimensions with extra-dimensional momenta being nonvanishing. This branch is characterized by massive external W-bosons and massless internal gluons propagating in loops. We analyze the five W-boson amplitude in the kinematics when their masses are much smaller than all Mandelstam-like invariants. This is what we dub the near mass-shell limit. We perform calculations to two-loop order in 't Hooft coupling, making use of recent advances in analytic calculations of required Feynman integrals. Our findings confirm exponentiation of infrared logarithms and enable us to conjecture a concise all-order expression for the amplitude in question. We further analyze its duality to the `square root' of a five-point correlation function of infinitely-heavy half-BPS operators, known as the decagon. By considering the near-null limit for inter-operators distances, we verify that the two objects coincide. This observation corroborates the novel Coulomb amplitudes/heavy correlator duality previously observed for four W-boson amplitudes and Sudakov form factors.</description>

      <title>Localization mechanism of the Kalb-Ramond field on brane with codimension-two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $2$-form Kalb-Ramond (KR) field, together with the metric tensor and dilaton, arises as one of the massless excitation mode of a closed string. Subsequently, this field plays an important role in both string theory and field theory. In this paper, we investigate the localization of the KR field on the brane with codimension-2. A general Kaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition is adopted, wherein the six-dimensional KR field is expanded into one four-dimensional (4D) KR field, two 4D vector fields, and one 4D scalar field. Then, for the case of the extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{R}_1$, only the 4D scalar field can be localized on the brane. In contrast, for the case of extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{S}_1$, one 4D vector field and the 4D scalar field can be localized on the brane at the same time. In both cases, the mass of the 4D scalar field remains zero. Next, we examine the localization of the KR field within a specific six-dimensional brane model with extra dimensions $\mathcal{R}_1\times\mathcal{S}_1$. By introducing the background scalar coupling, we show that the 4D KR field, along with the other three 4D fields, can be localized on the brane under the condition of the coupling parameter $t&gt;v^2/12$. Additionally in this case, for both the 4D KR field and the one 4D vector field which acquires its mass from the non-compact extra dimension, the resonant KK modes could exist near the origin of this extra dimension.</description>

      <title>On Time-Evolution in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an explicit BRST-exact operator identity for the bulk Hamiltonian in quantum gravity, working within a BRST-invariant quantization of General Relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory. We show that, up to a boundary term, the Hamiltonian can be written elegantly as the anticommutator of the BRST charge and the temporal ghost field. This form makes manifest that the Hamiltonian flow acts as a time-reparameterization on the correlation functions of the physical degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the BRST-exactness of the bulk Hamiltonian does not trivialize the time evolution of gravitational backgrounds or bulk correlators, nor does it trivialize scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomaly and Confinement in Two-dimensional QED: Singular Behavior of Vacuum Polarization at Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing the perturbative calculation of the vacuum polarization amplitude in QED1+1, one finds an anomalous axial vector Ward identity. We note that the photon self-energy function displays a singularity in the 1+1D case, in stark contrast to the 3+1D case. We discuss the nature of this singularity and its physical implications from the perspectives of axial anomaly and confinement in two-dimensional QED. Computing the total cross section of $e^+e^-\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and displaying the toy version of the R ratio in 1+1D with respect to the typical R ratio in 3+1D, we discuss the significance of using the dressed photon propagator in obtaining the finite cross section.</description>

      <title>Subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the new version of FeynGrav, a package that provides a set of tools to work with Feynman rules for gravity models. The new version addresses two principal issues and includes changes that improve user experience. Firstly, we present a more sophisticated implementation of the BRST formalism for general relativity and quadratic gravity, which results in a finite set of interaction rules between ghosts and gravitons. We also implement a realisation of a higher derivative gauge fixing term for quadratic gravity. Secondly, we implement Feynman rules for Cheung-Remmen variables. These variables present the general relativity action in a polynomial form and produce a finite set of Feynman rules. Lastly, we introduce some minor quality-of-life changes to the package to improve the user experience.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in holographic fractonic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, have recently emerged as a novel avenue for ergodicity breaking and garnered broad interest in condensed matter physics. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode as well as a fractonic subdiffusive mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the fracton mode remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that fractonic excitations are inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and are qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum-generating Algebra for Bosonic Strings in a Linear Dilaton Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the systematic construction of bosonic DDF operators to the light-like linear dilaton background to investigate how higher-spin string states behave beyond flat spacetime. Using previous results, we show that the spectrum-generating algebra is isomorphic to the flat case up to a few subtleties. This extension provides a controlled setting to explore higher-spin interactions in a nontrivial yet exactly solvable string background. Most of the derivations lead to expressions very similar to those in the flat background, with the expected modifications appearing quite naturally in the spectrum and the deformed momentum-(non)conserving delta function.</description>

      <title>Radiation Entropy in asymptotically AdS Black Holes within f(Q) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the island rule to study the radiation entropy in the background of asymptotically AdS black holes within f(Q) gravity. Through an analysis based on the Euclidean action, we find that within this framework the area term of the generalized entropy must be modified, leading to a corrected island rule. Using this rule to compute the radiation entropy in the eternal case shows that, although the result is time-independent, it diverges as the cutoff surface moves outward, indicating the breakdown of the s-wave approximation. For a collapsing black hole, the radiation entropy is dominated by the area term, with a logarithmic correction proportional to the area, which is consistent with the predictions of quantum gravity theories. Furthermore, both the radiation entropy and the Page time are ultimately influenced by the choice of the f(Q) model, implying that information about the underlying gravitational model is encoded in the final radiation entropy.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>The Probability of Vacuum Metastability and Artificial Vacuum Decay: Expert Survey Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum decay posits that the universe's apparent vacuum is metastable and could transition to a lower-energy state. According to current physics models, if such a transition occurred in any location, a region of "true vacuum" would propagate outward at near light speed, destroying the accessible universe as we know it by deeply altering the effective physical laws. Understanding whether advanced technology could potentially trigger such a transition has implications for existential risk assessment and the long-term trajectory of technological civilizations. We present results from what we believe to be the first structured survey of physics experts (n = 20) regarding both the theoretical possibility of vacuum decay and its potential technological inducibility. The average responded probability that our vacuum is metastable was 45.6%, with an average estimated 18.8% probability that arbitrarily advanced technology could induce vacuum decay if our vacuum is metastable. However, the survey revealed substantial disagreement among respondents on both whether the vacuum is metastable, and, if it is, whether vacuum decay could be artificially induced with arbitrarily advanced technology. According to participants, resolving these questions primarily depends on developing theories that go beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Among respondents who considered vacuum decay theoretically possible, it was generally expected that artificial induction would pose significant technological challenges even for a civilization with galactic resources.</description>

      <title>Mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal love numbers of anisotropic neutron stars in f (R,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal love numbers of anisotropic neutron stars (NSs) have been investigated in $f(R,T)$ gravity by imposing two equations of state (EoS). We use the simplest form $f(R,T)=R+2\beta T$ model and adopt the anisotropy approach called Horvat model. To examine the viability of our calculations, we utilize the constraints from GW170817 and GW190814 observations. Moreover, we consider three values of $\beta$, i.e. $\beta=0$, $\beta=-0.01$, $\beta=-0.02$ and four anisotropy parameters $\alpha$, i.e. $\alpha=-0.12$, $\alpha=-0.06$, $\alpha=0.06$, $\alpha=0.12$. Our findings suggest that all physical quantities depend on both parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Nevertheless, the impact of $\alpha$ is much more significant than $\beta$. The calculation of masses satisfy each used constraints for specific values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In the case of the moment of inertia, the results are compatible with the constraint obtained from radio observation of heavy pulsar. On the other hand, the tidal deformability of the NSs composed of one EoS satisfy the GW170817 constraint while the NSs composed of the other one EoS are too small. These small numbers can be interpreted as the property of secondary object observed in GW190814. As a result, our theoretical investigation of NSs constructed with two EoS can be NSs candidates for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spectral Chebyshev Approximation of Cosmic Expansion in $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework to study the cosmological background evolution in $f(R)$ gravity by employing a \textit{spectral Chebyshev collocation approach}. Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge--Kutta that often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands the normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series. The modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected Chebyshev--Gauss--Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear differential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series coefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and numerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0&lt;z&lt;z_{max}$, eliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two widely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu--Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a combined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union~3.0 supernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations to within $2\sigma$ over $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, producing best-fit parameters of approximately $(\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}) \simeq (0.29, 68, 1.2\text{--}2.5\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce the observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric corrections to $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a precise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity cosmologies in the precision-data era.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the modified cosmology inspired by string T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological consequences of a modified cosmology inspired by string T-duality. We incorporate the zero-point length correction, $l_0$, into the gravitational potential and derive the modified Friedmann equations via thermodynamic approach at the apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting framework introduces a dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta\sim l_0^2H_0^2$ quantifying deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Using Bayesian inference with \textsc{Cobaya} and MCMC sampling, we constrain the model parameter against late-time observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type~Ia supernovae, cosmic chronometers, DESI~DR2 BAO measurements, and Amati-calibrated GRBs. The joint analysis yields an upper bound $\beta \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ (68\% C.L.), implying that departures from $\Lambda$CDM are extremely small within current precision. Model comparison through the Akaike Information Criterion shows that the $\Lambda$CDM and T-duality models provide statistically equivalent fits to the data, exhibiting only a marginal preference for $\Lambda$CDM. These results provide the first quantitative observational constraints on string T-duality inspired modified cosmology and underscore the potential of future high-precision surveys to test quantum-gravity induced corrections in a late-time universe.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization and stress-energy of a quantum field inside of two-dimensional black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects are studied in both Schwarzschild spacetime and a spacetime in which a null shell collapses to form a black hole via the vacuum polarization $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and stress-energy tensor $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in two dimensions. For Schwarzschild spacetime, the Boulware, Unruh, and Hartle-Hawking states are considered. For the collapsing null shell spacetime, the \textit{in} vacuum state is used. Instabilities of the Unruh, Hartle-Hawking, and \textit{in} states resulting from the behavior of $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ in the regions inside and outside of the horizon are found. The question of how well the Unruh state for the eternal black hole approximates quantum effects in the interior of a black hole that forms from collapse is addressed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Brownian SYK-Hubbard Model: from Spectral Function to Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of complex correlations in strongly interacting systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. One fruitful approach is to develop solvable toy models that encapsulate universal properties shared by realistic systems. In this work, we introduce the Brownian SYK-Hubbard model, which combines the all-to-all random interactions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with on-site Hubbard-type interactions. This hybrid construction enables the study of the interplay between nonlocal random dynamics and local correlation effects: (1) As the interaction strength increases, the single-particle spectrum exhibits a transition from a single peak to a two-peak structure, signaling the onset of Mottness. (2) The spectral form factor undergoes a sequence of dynamical transitions as the evolution time increases before reaching the plateau in the long-time limit under strong Hubbard interactions. (3) The out-of-time-order correlator is computed by summing a series of modified ladder diagrams, which determines the quantum Lyapunov exponent and reveals a violation of the bound on branching time. Our results establish a new analytically tractable platform for exploring the effects of Hubbard interactions in chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Constraining Black Hole Shadows in Dunkl Spacetime using CUDA Numerical Computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the help of CUDA high-performance numerical codes exploited in machine learning, we investigate the shadow aspect of new rotating and charged black holes using the Dunkl derivative formalism. Precisely, we first establish the corresponding metric function encoding the involved physical properties including the optical character. Exploiting such accelerated simulations, we approach the horizon radius behaviors in order to determine the regions of the module space providing physical solutions. Applying the Hamilton-Jacobi mechanism, we assess the shadow aspect for non-rotating and rotating solutions. Using such an aspect, we evaluate the energy rate of emission. Developing a high-performance CUDA numerical code, we derive strict constraints on the Dunkl deformation parameters in order to establish a link with the shadow observations provided by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration.</description>

      <title>Frame Dependence of Bound on Lyapunov Exponent in Dilatonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frame dependence of the Lyapunov exponent bound for charged particles in dilatonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole backgrounds, derived from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory and the low-energy effective action of heterotic string theory, respectively. The analysis is performed in both the Einstein and string (Jordan) frames to examine the influence of conformal transformations on chaotic behavior. For massless particles, the Lyapunov exponent remains invariant under frame transformations, whereas for massive particles, it exhibits frame dependence owing to coupling to the dilaton field. Our results indicate sensitivity of the bound on chaos to the choice of frame. Depending on various parameters, the bound can be satisfied in the Einstein frame and violated in the string frame, while the opposite situation may occur for different parameter values. Numerical computations corroborate the findings of our analysis and demonstrate modifications in the chaotic behavior of string-inspired black holes induced by the dilaton field and the choice of frame.</description>

      <title>Structure formation in a non-canonical scalar field model of clustering dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the growth of dark matter and dark energy perturbations within a non-canonical scalar field model characterized by an exponential potential. Through dynamical system analysis, we identify critical points and track the background evolution of a spatially flat FLRW universe dominated by dark energy and pressureless dark matter. We systematically derive key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, density parameters, and the scalar field's equation of state, and explore their dependence on model parameters. Within the linear perturbation framework, employing the pseudo-Newtonian formalism, we compute the growth factor of matter density perturbations. To investigate the non-linear regime of structure formation, we employ the spherical collapse model and derive its key parameters. Building on these findings, we compute the function $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ and the relative number density of halo objects exceeding a given mass threshold. Our results indicate that non-canonical scalar field models can effectively account for both background cosmic evolution and the growth of structure, offering potential insights into observational constraints and large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flux-Conservative BDNK Hydrodynamics and Shock Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, first-order, flux-conservative formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the BDNK framework, applicable to conformal and nonconformal fluids at zero chemical potential. Focusing on the conformal case in 1+1 dimensions, we numerically solve the equations of motion for two classes of consistent initial data and assess the robustness of the resulting solutions with respect to changing the hydrodynamic frame. Our flux-conservative formulation does not exhibit spurious oscillatory structures within the regime of validity of BDNK theory (the hydrodynamic-frame-robust regime), corresponding to sufficiently small Knudsen numbers. Using this flux-conservative approach, we numerically investigate the potential formation of shocks and their fate in BDNK in 1+1D using smooth initial data known to produce shocks in the relativistic Euler equations. For the type of initial data we consider, we show that the sharp features formed in Euler are prevented by the hyperbolic viscous BDNK equations. The prevention of shock formation we observe occurs in the frame-robust regime of BDNK. This, however, does not preclude the formation of shocks in BDNK for different smooth initial data. The reliability of our results is supported by systematic numerical convergence testing, which is used to assess shock indicators, simulation performance, and the robustness of solutions for different hydrodynamic frames.</description>

Abstract: We derive a modified dispersion relation for massive particles within the frameworks of five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory and general relativity, taking into account strong gravitational effects. The resulting effective mass depends on the curvature of the underlying phase space. Notably, in regions with strong gravitational fields, the effective mass may become imaginary, implying the possibility of particle decay induced by spacetime curvature.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group for classical liquids without recourse to hard-core reference systems: A study of three-dimensional Lennard-Jones liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. E 104, 014124 (2021)], we developed a method for analyzing classical liquids using the functional renormalization group (FRG) without relying on a hard-core reference system. In this paper, we extend that method to three-dimensional liquids. We describe an efficient approach for performing the spatial integrals that appear in the renormalization group equations, which is essential for realizing numerical calculations in three dimensions. As a demonstration of our method, we present its application to the Lennard-Jones liquid. By calculating thermodynamic quantities and the pair distribution function near the critical point, we find that, compared with integral equation methods, the FRG approach preserves thermodynamic consistency much more effectively and more accurately reproduces the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we successfully capture characteristic phase-transition phenomena with FRG, such as the softening of pressure near the critical temperature. Our results suggest that FRG can provide a more accurate framework for describing classical liquids than conventional methods such as integral equation theories.</description>

Abstract: The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a globally defined one. Translations and Carroll boosts, associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Imprints of a Second Order Electroweak Phase Transition on the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we shall study the impact of a second order electroweak phase transition occurring at $\sim 150\,$GeV on the energy spectrum of the stochastic gravitational background. Specifically, we assume that the non-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the reheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that the Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase transition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the electroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase transition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase transition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field slow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may deform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this work is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state deformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that affects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\sim 150\,$GeV or lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to wave interference, an ultralight light dark matter halo has stochastic, granular substructures which can scatter stars, leading to the heating of stellar distributions. Studies of this phenomenon have placed lower bounds on the ultralight dark matter mass. In this paper we investigate a number of relevant systematic effects, including: (1) the heating by the central soliton, (2) the self-gravity of the stars, (3) the suppression of heating in a tidally stripped halo, and (4) the tidal field suppression of heating when the stellar cluster is much smaller than the de Broglie wavelength. The first three effects are quantified by studying the dynamics of stellar particles in Schrodinger-Poisson simulations of ultralight dark matter halos, while the last effect is studied using analytic approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced in models of axion inflation coupled to gauge fields. Achieving a detectable signal at Pulsar Timing Array, astrometry, or interferometer frequencies requires a sufficiently strong amplification of the gauge fields, at a level that induces significant backreaction on the inflaton background dynamics. Numerical studies based on the approximation of homogeneous backreaction (i.e., neglecting inhomogeneities of the inflaton field) exhibit oscillations in the inflaton velocity, with corresponding peaks in the SGWB spectrum. The most recent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing examples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and the breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density perturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining examples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that remains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout inflation.</description>

To simplify the discussion, motivate the construction, and make it easier for the reader to understand the technical points, we also include the construction of the cohomology theory of supercommutative associative algebras, a generalization of the Harrison cohomology theory of a commutative algebra that has not been explicitly written down. The paper will serve as the foundation for many subsequent studies, especially, the deformation theory of vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. On the symmetry-invariant subspace, $\mathcal{U}$ is well-defined and unitary, and the coupled Hamiltonian is obtained from the decoupled one by conjugation with $\mathcal{U}$. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Tagged vector space, Part I: Dirac notation as originally intended</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization is provided for the notion of tags, as used in various formulations of physical scenarios. It leads to the definition of tagged vector spaces, based on a set of axioms for tags and their extractors. As an application, such a tagged vector space is used to provide, in the context of quantum optics, a formal mathematical description for the Dirac notation that is closer to its intended usage compared to current mathematical formulations: it provides a one-to-one mapping between kets and bras and allows operators to operate either to the left or to the right. The canonical commutation relations for the quadrature and ladder operators are derived as consequences of the axioms of the tagged vector space. These axioms also lead to a symplectic phase space with the Wigner function and the Weyl transform emerging naturally.</description>

      <title>Some Identities For Periods of Hulek-Verrill Threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hulek--Verrill families of Calabi--Yau threefolds. They are birationally equivalent to fibred products of elliptic surfaces, so we expect to be able to compute periods on these threefolds by integrating products of elliptic periods over a contour on $\mathbb{P}^1$. We numerically verify this in several examples. This article was submitted to MATRIX Annals (2024) for inclusion in the proceedings of the conference "The Geometry of Moduli Spaces in String Theory", held 2--13 September 2024.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability of $q,t$-matrix models and quantum toroidal algebra recursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $q,t$-deformed matrix models give rise to representations of the deformed Virasoro algebra and more generally of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. These representations are described in terms of finite difference equations that induce recursion relations for correlation functions. Under suitable assumptions, these recursions admit unique solutions expressible through "superintegrability" formulas, i.e. explicit closed formulas for averages of Macdonald polynomials. In this paper, we discuss examples arising from localization of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, which include $q,t$-deformation of well known classical ensembles: Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi. We explain how relations in the quantum toroidal algebra can be used to give a new and universal proof of the known superintegrability formulas, as well as to derive new formulas for models that have not been previously studied in the literature. Finally, we make some remarks regarding the relation between superintegrability and orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the axion is the most compelling solution to the strong CP problem, the ad hoc introduced global Peccei-Quinn symmetry suffers from a severe fine-tuning problem known as the quality problem. In this Letter, we show that the discrete gauge symmetry $\mathbb Z_4 \times \mathbb Z_3$ motivated from the internal structure of the Standard Model can naturally predict a high-quality axion, leading to a distinct and testable parameter space. Remarkably, this minimal framework simultaneously accounts for neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry, and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Production of gravitational waves by inflationary transitions in aligned natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original axion natural inflation model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio exceeding experimental limits. Conversely, in aligned axion inflation, inflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of the two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal direction. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be tested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the possibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition characterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate that the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We explore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This mechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or axion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent power spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by the duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may peak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments.</description>

      <title>An Extended Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics constitutes a fundamental principle of physics, precluding the existence of perpetual motion machines and providing a natural definition of the arrow of time. Its scope extends across virtually all areas of physical theory. Nonetheless, certain systems are known to admit negative absolute temperatures under well-defined conditions, a phenomenon that has been experimentally observed. In this work, we formulate an \textit{extended} version of the first and second laws, which recovers the conventional statement for positive temperatures and extends its applicability to the negative-temperature domain. Illustrative examples are discussed in the contexts of quantum cosmology and Onsager's vortices.</description>

      <title>Photon radiation induced by rescattering in strong-interacting medium with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet traversing a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies as the jet propagates through the medium. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. These results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate an experimental comparison of photon yields from Quark-Gluon Plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on the lower bound of the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ at continuous phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in the renormalization-group (RG) theory of critical phenomena concerns the allowed values of critical exponents that are consistent with the continuous nature of a phase transition. Here we conjecture a lower bound for the length-scale exponent $\nu$ that should hold at continuous transitions associated with $d$-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) $\Phi^4$ theories with a multicomponent scalar field $\varphi_i$ (including some extensions with fermionic and gauge fields). If $\Delta_\varphi=(d-2+\eta)/2$ is the dimension of the order parameter -- $\varphi_i$ in LGW models -- and $\Delta_\varepsilon=d-1/\nu$ is the RG dimension of the energy operator $\varepsilon$, which can be identified with $[\sum_i \varphi_i^2]$ (the squared field with a proper subtraction of the mixing with the identity), we conjecture the inequality $\Delta_\varepsilon - 2 \Delta_\varphi\ge 0$, which implies $1/\nu \le 2-\eta$ and $\gamma = (2-\eta)\nu\ge 1$. These inequalities are supported by general arguments for lattice models, exact relations for two-dimensional minimal conformal field theories, and are consistent with all known (numerical, perturbative, and exact) results for LGW $\Phi^4$ theories. In particular, since unitarity requires $\eta\ge 0$, the above inequality implies $\nu\ge 1/2$ for unitary theories. This lower bound is more restrictive than the bound $\nu &gt; 1/d$, which is derived by noting that $\nu=1/d$ is the expected behavior at first-order transitions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

Abstract: We establish a duality relation between Hamiltonian systems and neural network-based learning systems. We show that the Hamilton's equations for position and momentum variables correspond to the equations governing the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables and the learning dynamics of trainable variables. The duality is then applied to model various field theories using the activation and learning dynamics of neural networks. For Klein-Gordon fields, the corresponding weight tensor is symmetric, while for Dirac fields, the weight tensor must contain an anti-symmetric tensor factor. The dynamical components of the weight and bias tensors correspond, respectively, to the temporal and spatial components of the gauge field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the smoothness of the classical limit of inclusive observables in the formalism developed by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC). Building on the earlier work [1-3], we prove that the classical limit of three classes of inclusive observables, namely scattering angle, radiative field and angular impulse is smooth and does not suffer from any so-called superclassical divergences at all orders in perturbation. Our analysis goes some way in showing that KMOC formalism can be used to compute classical radiation by simply focussing on all the terms that scale as $\hbar^0$ as all the terms that scale with inverse power of $\hbar$ vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermal Carrollian correlators at null infinity in the real-time formalism. We derive the Feynman rules to calculate these correlators in the position space. We compute the bulk-to-bulk, bulk-to-boundary and boundary-to-boundary propagators for massless scalar theory. Due to the doubling of the fields degrees of freedom, the number of each propagator is quadrupled. The bulk-to-boundary propagators have the form of (extended) Bose-Einstein distribution in the position space. Utilizing the contour integral of the propagators, we can transform the Feynman rules to momentum space. Interestingly, while the external lines and amplitudes in momentum space depend on the contour, Carrollian correlators in position space are independent of it. We show how to compute four-point correlators at finite temperature. The tree level correlators can be written as the summation of Barnes zeta functions and reduce to the ones in the zero temperature limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new semi-supervised machine learning package is introduced which successfully solves the Euclidean vacuum Einstein equations with a cosmological constant, without any symmetry assumptions. The model architecture contains subnetworks for each patch in the manifold-defining atlas. Each subnetwork predicts the components of a metric in its associated patch, with the relevant Einstein conditions of the form $R_{\mu \nu} - \lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 0$ being used as independent loss components (here $\mu,\nu = 1, 2, \cdots, n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the Riemannian manifold, and the Einstein constant $\lambda \in \{+1, 0, -1\}$). To ensure the consistency of the global structure of the manifold, another loss component is introduced across the patch subnetworks which enforces the coordinate transformation between the patches, $g' = J^T g J$, for an appropriate analytically known Jacobian $J$. We test our method for the case of spheres represented by a pair of patches in dimensions 2, 3, 4, and 5. In dimensions 2 and 3, the geometries have been fully classified. However, it is unknown whether a Ricci-flat metric can exist on spheres in dimensions 4 and 5. This work hints against the existence of such a metric.</description>

      <title>Discrete Bulk Spectrum in Jackiw-Teitelboim Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a discrete bulk spectrum with random statistics appears naturally in the Lorentzian description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity if an extra confining potential is introduced in the region where the renormalized geodesic length becomes of order $e^{S_0}$. The existence of such an extra confining potential may be inferred from the late behavior of complexity and also from the Saad-Shenker-Stanford (SSS) duality between JT gravity and the matrix model. We derive the explicit form of the extra confining potential from the well-established density of states obtained in the Euclidean approach to JT gravity. This extra potential is implicitly determined by the solution of the Abel's integral equation which turns out to be identical to the string equation of the matrix model in the SSS duality formulation of JT gravity. Thanks to the extra confining potential and the random nature of the spectrum, the time evolution of the Krylov complexity, which is identified with the renormalized geodesic length, naturally exhibits four phases, namely a ramp, a peak, a slope, and a plateau.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B&gt;B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B&lt;B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</description>

Abstract: We define a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for the restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles. The theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. We argue that the existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background and show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the ghost-free bimetric theory of gravity with the concept of local Weyl invariance, realized in the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. The gravitational sector, characterized by two independent metrics and two independent connections, is coupled to a scalar field that can in principle develop a non-vanishing expectation value through radiative corrections. The spectrum of the model, apart from the massless standard graviton and a pair of axion-like pseudoscalars, associated with the presence of the Holst invariants in the action, includes an additional spin-$2$ state of a non-vanishing Fierz-Pauli mass proportional to the scalar field vacuum expectation value. We analyze the phenomenology of the model and specify the conditions under which the massive spin-$2$ state could be a primary dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Symmetry Fractionalization without 1-Form Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractionalization of 0-form global symmetries on line operators in theories without 1-form global symmetries. The projective transformation properties of line operators are renormalization group invariant, and we derive constraints which are similar to the consequences of exact 1-form symmetries. For instance, symmetry fractionalization can lead to exact selection rules for line operators in twisted sectors, and in theories with 't Hooft anomalies involving the fractionalization class, these selection rules can further imply that certain twisted sectors have exact finite-volume vacuum degeneracies. Along the way, we define topological operators on open codimension-1 manifolds, which we call `disk operators', that provide a convenient way of encoding the projective action of 0-form symmetries on lines. In addition, we discuss the possible ways symmetry fractionalization can be matched along renormalization group flows.</description>

      <title>Boundary anomalous dimensions from BCFT: O($N$)-symmetric $\phi^{2n}$ theories with a boundary and higher-derivative generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $\phi^{2n}$ deformations of the O($N$)-symmetric (generalized) free theories with a flat boundary, where $n\geqslant 2$ is an integer. The generalized free theories refer to the $\Box^k$ free scalar theories with a higher-derivative kinetic term, which is related to the multicritical generalizations of the Lifshitz type. We assume that the (generalized) free theories and the deformed theories have boundary conformal symmetry and O($N$) global symmetry. The leading anomalous dimensions of some boundary operators are derived from the bulk multiplet recombination and analyticity constraints. We find that the $\epsilon^{1/2}$ expansion in the $\phi^6$-tricritical version of the special transition extends to other multicritical cases with larger odd integer $n$, and most of the higher derivative cases involve a noninteger power expansion in $\epsilon$. Using the analytic bootstrap, we further verify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with boundary crossing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting a family of five-dimensional charged, rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of a higher-dimensional analogue to the Kerr-Newman black hole, 5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simons term has become a natural setting for studying charged, stationary solutions. A prominent example is the Chong-Cveti\v{c}-L\"{u}-Pope (CCLP) solution, which describes a non-extremal black hole with electric charge and two independent angular momenta. This solution has been widely studied, and generalizations have been proposed. In this paper, we revisit a large family of five-dimensional black hole solutions to Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons (EMCS) field equations, which admits to be written in terms of a generalized Pleba\'{n}ski-Demia\'{n}ski ansatz and includes the CCLP and the Kerr-NUT-Anti-de Sitter solutions as particular cases. We show that the complete family can be brought to the CCLP form by means of a suitable coordinate transformation and a complex redefinition of parameters. Then, we compute the conserved charges associated to the CCLP form of the metric by analyzing the near-horizon asymptotic symmetries. We show that the zero-mode of the near-horizon charges exactly match the result of the Komar integrals.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of Mellin amplitudes for AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of half-BPS single-particle operators of the D1-D5 system in the supergravity regime is dual to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes of tensor and graviton multiplets in AdS$_3\times$S$^3$. We present simple formulae for all four-point tree-level correlators of scalar half-BPS primary operators in the spectrum, and in particular, we bootstrap the four-point correlator of the graviton multiplet for all KK levels. A key insight of our approach is the use of generalized Mellin space, and a decomposition of the correlators into distinct subsectors each one characterized by different on-shell constraints among the Mellin variables. The resulting Mellin amplitudes involve a small set of building blocks with manifest properties under a six-dimensional symmetry.</description>

      <title>Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously in \cite{Tao:2025fch}, we constructed the $\ell$-loop planar integrands using loop components and loop kernels by some recursion rules. In this paper, we propose a new formalism to express the loop kernel recursion. We define ``graded inverse variables" to make the loop kernel recursion more elegant. And the graph factor, including the symmetry factor, can be figured out from each monomial of some variables. This new formalism makes the previous $\ell$-loop integrand recursion clearer.</description>

Abstract: The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chiral anomaly for systems with a wide class of Hermitian Dirac operators ${Q}$ in 4D Euclidean spacetime. We suppose that $ Q$ is not necessarily linear in derivatives and also that it contains a coordinate inhomogeneity unrelated to that of the external gauge field. We use the covariant Wigner-Weyl calculus (in which the Wigner transformed two point Greens function belongs to the two-index tensor representation of the gauge group) and point splitting regularization to calculate the global expression for the anomaly. The Atiyah-Singer theorem can be applied to relate the anomaly to the topological index of $ Q$. We show that the topological index factorizes (under certain assumptions) into the topological invariant $\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int \text{tr}(F\wedge F)$ (composed of the gauge field strength) multiplied by a topological invariant $N_3$ in phase space. The latter is responsible for the topological stability of Fermi points/Fermi surfaces and is related to the conductivity of the chiral separation effect.</description>

Abstract: This letter serves as the generalization of the work 2505.16436, where we investigated the quantum field theory in Klein space which has two time directions. We extend studies to the general spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{n,d-n}\,(n,d-n\geq2)$ in a similar manner: the ``length of time'' $q$ is regarded as the evolution direction of the system; additional modes beyond the plane wave modes are introduced in the canonical quantization. We show that this novel formulation is consistent with the analytical continuation of the results in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of gravity the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms have been developed largely independently, emphasizing renormalization and quantization, respectively. The formalisms use a different methodology to distinguish between gauge and physical degrees of freedom. In this review we analyze the connection between the Asymptotically Safe and Canonical Quantum Gravity approaches. Based on the Hamiltonian formulation, the Canonical Quantum Gravity approach inherently provides a natural framework for defining observables. This serves as the foundation for constructing the generating functional of the $n$-point correlation functions of physical degrees of freedom. By means of background-independent, non-perturbative renormalization methods well-established in the Lagrangian framework and typically employed in Asymptotic Safety, the resulting generating functional can be handled. In particular, we employ the Functional Renormalization Group to regularize the path integral and to compute the flow connecting the bare theory in the ultraviolet with the effective infrared theory. An important advantage of this approach is that it establishes an explicit, systematic relation between the quantization procedure and the systematics of quantum field theory-based renormalization group methods. More importantly, this synthesis not only bridges canonical and covariant approaches but also paves the way for a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity grounded in physically meaningful, gauge-invariant observables.</description>

Abstract: The Regge-Gribov model of the pomeron and odderon in the non-trivial transverse space is studied by the renormalization group technique in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied. The singuarities in the form of non-trivial branch points indicating a phase transition are found in the vicinity of five fixed points found in the previous publication. Since new phases violate the projectile-target symmetry the model is found non-physical for the bare intercepts above their critical value.</description>

Abstract: In this note we consider examples of decomposition (in which a local QFT is equivalent to a disjoint union of multiple independent theories, known as universes) where there is a continuous familiy of universes, rather than a finite or countably infinite collection. In particular, this allows us to consistently eliminate all instantons in a local QFT via a suitable topological gauging of the (-1)-form symmetry. In two-dimensional U(1) gauge theories, this is equivalent to changing the gauge group to R. This makes both locality as well as the instanton restriction explicit. We apply this to clarify the Gross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure Yang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge theories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric gauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R. In that context, we find that analogues of the Witten effect for dyons, here rotating between universes, play a role in relating anomalies of the individual universes to (different) anomalies in the disjoint union. Finally, we discuss limits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction, which accomplish instanton restriction by topologically gauging a Q/Z (-1)-form symmetry, and speculate in two-dimensional theories on possible interpretations of those limits in terms of the adelic solenoid.</description>

      <title>Holographic Timelike Entanglement Across Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a holographic framework for computing timelike entanglement entropy (tEE) in quantum field theories, extending the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription into Lorentzian settings. Using three broad classes of supergravity backgrounds, we derive both exact and approximate tEE expressions for slab, spherical, and hyperbolic regions, and relate them to the central charges of the dual conformal field theories. The method is applied to infinite families of supersymmetric linear quivers in dimensions from d=2 to d=6, showing that Liu-Mezei and slab central charges scale universally like the holographic central charge. We then analyse gapped and confining models, including twisted compactifications and wrapped brane constructions, identifying how a mass gap modifies tEE and when approximate formulas remain accurate. In all cases, we uncover robust scaling with invariant separations and signature dependent phase behaviour, distinguishing spacelike from timelike embeddings. Our results unify the treatment of tEE in both conformal and nonconformal theories, clarifying its role as a probe of causal structure, universal data, and nonperturbative dynamics in holography.</description>

Abstract: Off-shell actions for massless higher-spin $\mathcal{N}=1$ supermultiplets in five dimensions (5D) are constructed in harmonic superspace in terms of unconstrained prepotentials. Cubic couplings of these supermultiplets to the $q$-hypermultiplet are derived. We also provide a detailed derivation of the unconstrained prepotential for the 5D Weyl supermultiplet which has been used within the conformal superspace approach to $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Holographic solutions from 5D $SO(2)\times ISO(3)$ $N=4$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various types of holographic solutions from five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)\times ISO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity can be obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions on a Riemann surface. For a negatively curved Rimann surface $H^2$, the resulting five-dimensional gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=4$ $AdS_5$ critical point. This $AdS_5$ vacuum is dual to an $N=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) arising from M5-branes wrapped on $H^2$. We study holographic RG flow solutions describing deformations of this SCFT by turning on relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators to $N=2$ non-conformal phases in the IR. Solutions describing conformal interfaces between these non-conformal phases and singular boundaries are also given. We finally study a number of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black string and black hole solutions holographically dual to RG flows across dimensions from the $N=2$ SCFT to two-dimensional SCFTs and superconformal quantum mechanics in the IR. A number of solutions describing black strings and black holes in asymptotically domain wall space-time is also found. All of the solutions can be uplifted to M-theory by a consistent truncation on $H^2\times S^4$.</description>

Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of the gauge/gravity correspondence in which the boundary theory can reside on any timelike codimension-one surface in AdS space, and the boundary conditions on the bulk fields can be chosen arbitrarily. Freelance holography provides the framework for a systematic study of various boundary conditions and associated bulk geometries. In this work, we analyze in detail the AdS$_3$ freelance holography. One can explicitly solve for the bulk AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity equations of motion. For generic boundary conditions, the solutions are described by two arbitrary functions of one variable. We study holographic renormalization group (RG) flows, the interpolation between different boundary conditions at different boundaries and associated surface charges and their algebras.</description>

      <title>The equivalence between local inertial frames and electromagnetic gauge in Einstein-Maxwell theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:1308.1076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that locally the inertial frames and gauge states of the electromagnetic field are equivalent. This proof is valid for Einstein-Maxwell theories in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. Use will be made of theorems proved in a previous manuscript. These theorems state that locally the group of electromagnetic gauge transformations is isomorphic to the local group of Lorentz transformations of a special set of tetrad vectors. The tetrad that locally and covariantly diagonalizes any non-null electromagnetic stress-energy tensor. Two isomorphisms, one for each orthogonal plane of stress-energy eigenvectors. We will discuss the opposite problem in this paper. What happens with local electromagnetic gauge when the test object under study is boosted by any mechanical means. We will prove that boosting matter is indistinguishable from introducing an appropriate local electromagnetic gauge transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, the coupling of an axion to non-Abelian gauge fields causes dissipation due to sphaleron heating. This mechanism has been considered as ideal for realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while preserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring standard properties of an axion -- in particular a discrete shift symmetry -- excludes the strong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates. The present argument, which does not rely on any phenomenological input, leaves room for the weak regime of warm axion inflation, but in this case a super-Planckian decay constant represents a well-known issue. Finally, we discuss non-minimal and axion-like models as way out.</description>

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space for Wigner-positive states and proposals for Wigner-negative states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum resource theory, one is often interested in identifying which states serve as the best resources for particular quantum tasks. If a relative comparison between quantum states can be made, this gives rise to a partial order, where states are ordered according to their suitability to act as a resource. In the literature, various different partial orders for a variety of quantum resources have been proposed. In discrete variable systems, vector majorization of Wigner functions in discrete phase space provides a natural partial order between quantum states. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In addition, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. For the special case of the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf. We also prove a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of shift symmetric Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories (theories in which only derivatives of the scalar field appear in the action). Utilizing Euclidean methods, we first analyze two specific cases that serve as foundational examples for the broader framework. We derive the general expression for entropy variation within this setting, for homogeneous spacetimes (with $g_{tt}=1/g_{rr}$), demonstrating that both parity-preserving and parity violating terms contribute to the entropy formula. Given the functional form of the coupling terms, the black hole entropy can be determined by integrating this relation with respect to the event horizon. Our general result is consistent with previously reported special cases in the literature. Notably, for particular constraints on the coupling functions, the entropy identically vanishes. Furthermore, we establish that homogeneous spacetimes within shift and parity symmetric beyond Horndeski theories universally obey the Bekenstein Area Law for entropy, irrespective of the specific form of the coupling functions.</description>

      <title>Thawing quintessence and transient cosmic acceleration in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of the DESI Collaboration challenges the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, suggesting evidence for a dynamic dark energy. These results are obtained in the context of generic parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which better fit the data when they exhibit an unphysical phantom behavior in the past. In this paper, we briefly analyze how ambiguous this latter conclusion can be in light of the background degeneracy between EoS parameterizations and minimally coupled quintessence scenarios. We then investigate whether the current observational data can be accommodated with a non-phantom, thawing dark energy EoS, typical of a broad class of quintessence models. We show that the thawing behavior of this EoS performs comparabily to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization and is statistically competitive with $\Lambda$CDM while predicting cosmic acceleration as a transient phenomenon. Such a dynamic behavior aligns with theoretical arguments from string theory and offers a way out of the trans-Planckian problem that challenges the ever-accelerated $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by a Deligne-Mumford superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces</title>

Abstract: We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Moreover, we find that the maximum tidal force always occurs along the radial direction, regardless of the particle's motion. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also demonstrate that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. Finally, we examine a wormhole solution which possesses a curvature singularity at its throat and was previously asserted to be geodesically complete in the literature. However, we prove that no metric can be defined at the throat and thus the spacetime is geodesically incomplete. we also show that the tidal forces experienced by any particle near the singularity are divergent.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_N$ stability and continuity in twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with two-flavor adjoint fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) reduced model of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory in the presence of two-flavor adjoint fermions (adjoint TEK model). Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist parameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\ll\kappa_c $) and inverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions stabilize the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal twist satisfying $k/\sqrt{N} &lt; 1/9$, where the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also suggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to $SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the adjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially reduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ and study the theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions. Numerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and $\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with periodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined) phase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining transition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic adjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency checks supporting these findings.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes of $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ including pentaquark components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the helicity amplitudes of the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances in the electromagnetic transition process $\gamma^*p\to N^*$, where the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ are assumed to include both the $L=1$ three-quark and $L=0$ spatial symmetric $q^4\bar q$ pentaquark components. The helicity transition amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$ (for spin 3/2 states) and $S_{1/2}$ are computed within the constituent quark model. The inclusion of the $q^4 \bar q$ pentaquark components via the $\gamma^*\to q\bar q$ diagram significantly improves the theoretical description of the helicity amplitudes for both $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$, yielding a closer agreement with experimental data compared to the pure three-quark picture. The work reveals that the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ resonances may contain a considerable pentaquark components.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large $N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis. On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

      <title>Marginal IR running of Gravity as a Natural Explanation for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the infrared (IR) running of Newton's coupling provides a simple and universal explanation for large--distance modifications of gravity relevant to dark matter phenomenology. Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we model $G(k)$ as a scale--dependent coupling governed by an anomalous dimension $\eta$. We show that the marginal case $\eta = 1$ is singled out by renormalization group (RG) and dimensional arguments, leading to a logarithmic potential and a $1/r$ force law at large distances, while smoothly recovering Newtonian gravity at short scales. The logarithmic correction is universal and regulator independent, indicating that the $1/r$ force arises as the robust IR imprint of quantum--field--theoretic scaling. This provides a principled alternative to particle dark matter, suggesting that galactic rotation curves and related anomalies may be understood as manifestations of the IR running of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Resource complexity of Symmetry Protected Topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the identification of quantum resources carried by topological order, by evaluating quantum magic, quantified through the rank-$2$ Stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $\mathcal{M}_2$, in one-dimensional systems hosting symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTP). Focusing on models with an exact duality between an SPTP and a trivial one, namely the dimerized XX and the Cluster-Ising chains, we show that dual points exhibit identical amounts of magic, even thought they belong to distinct topological sectors. A subextensive asymmetry arises only under open boundary conditions, where edge effects break the duality, but this correction is non-topological and depends on microscopic parameters. These results stand in contrast to the case of topological frustration, where delocalized excitations enhance the magic logarithmically with system size. They also complement recent analyses in the literature, showing that the total magic is largely insensitive to the presence of topological order, hence suggesting that topological order is not necessarily a genuine computational resource.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression in Quantum Field Theories: Holography, Chaos, and Mixed-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that entanglement entropy growth in conformal field theories (CFTs) can be suppressed when a local operator quench interacts with a mixed-state excitation, providing a dual interpretation in terms of black hole scattering in AdS. This phenomenon, termed \emph{entanglement suppression}, opens several promising directions for exploration. In this proposal, I outline five distinct yet interconnected research trajectories: generalization to higher dimensions, the role of quantum chaos via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), the absence of suppression in integrable models, the extension to entanglement negativity as a probe of mixedness, and a geometric interpretation based on scattering cross sections in AdS. Each direction offers new insights into the interplay between holography, non-equilibrium dynamics, and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space. As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and generality.</description>
