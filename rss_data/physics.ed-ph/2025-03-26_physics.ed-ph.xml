      <title>The Quantum Technology Job Market: A Quantitative Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a "human-in-the-loop" validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</description>

      <title>Motivating reflection in problem solving: homework corrections in upper-division physics courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recognition that reflection is an essential part of problem solving, it is often not emphasized in upper-division physics courses. In this paper, we discuss homework corrections (HWCs) as a pedagogical tool to motivate reflection on homework assignments. We focus on gaining a qualitative understanding of how students may engage with the process of homework corrections, considering potential impacts on content understanding, metacognitive skills, and affect. To do so, we present three comparative case studies to elucidate different aspects of student engagement with HWCs; we also present descriptive statistics of participation in HWCs. We find that HWCs can be a useful pedagogical tool, but more scaffolding may be necessary to support students in identifying and learning from their mistakes, even in upper-division courses.</description>

      <title>Directed Self Guided Learning of Blended Math-Science Sensemaking for Historically Marginalized STEM Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blended math science sensemaking (MSS) is reflected in a student ability to integrate math and science knowledge to develop mathematical descriptions of observations. While an important component of scientific thinking, there is little research on teaching MSS. Students from backgrounds historically marginalized in STEM often lack prior learning opportunities needed to succeed in STEM. Supporting them in developing MSS could help them build quantitative understanding and improve STEM performance. Fostering MSS calls for supporting transferable, lifelong skills. We designed and tested a self-guided learning model grounded in simulations and a cognitive framework to achieve transferable MSS. We tested the activities grounded in the framework with 27 students from backgrounds historically marginalized in STEM attending minority serving 2- and 4-year US colleges. We evaluated long and short-term MSS transfer by asking student to complete transfer tasks immediately following and at least 1 week post activity. Most students started at the lowest and progressed to the highest MSS level and demonstrated considerable short and long-term transfer after completing just one activity, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach for fostering transferable MSS.</description>

      <title>The role of natural language in understanding the universe: a teaching-learning sequence for high school students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing gravitational physics at high school provides educational means for bridging the gap between the image of science held by students and science itself. Natural language is fundamental in this learning. It engages students in constructing an understanding of a concept or a notion, establishing new relations between previous and new elements of knowledge. We present a teaching/learning sequence (TLS) aimed to contextualize gravitational physics along the lines of the Einstein Telescope educational program in Sardinia devoted to upper secondary school students. We focused on the role of debates and controversy in the evolution of science, proposing science-reflexive meta discourses to present physics as a unified knowledge textbook. We discuss our design and present results by analyzing students' semiotic registers to recap their learning during the activity. Finally, we discuss the potentiality of our TLS in orientating students towards STEM.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics model of collaborative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model to explore an educational phenomenon where the correct answer emerges from group discussion. We construct our model based on several plausible assumptions: (i) We tend to follow peers' opinions. However, if a peer's opinion is too different from yours, you are not much influenced. In other words, your opinion tends to align with peers' opinions, weighted by the similarity to yours. (ii) Discussion among group members helps the opinion to shift toward the correct answer even when the group members do not know it clearly. However, if everyone tells exactly the same, you often get lost and it becomes more difficult to find the correct answer. In other words, you can find the correct answer when everyone has largely different voices. (iii) We are sometimes stuck to our past. If you keep one opinion for a long time, such a memory works like an inertia in classical mechanics. We use our model to perform numerical investigations and find that the performance of a group is enhanced when initial opinions are diverse, that a lower memory capacity makes consensus occur faster, and that a small group size, typically three or four, is beneficial for better group performance.</description>
