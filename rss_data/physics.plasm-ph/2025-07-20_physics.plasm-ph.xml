      <title>Scalable Chrysopoeia via $(n, 2n)$ Reactions Driven by Deuterium-Tritium Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalable approach for chrysopoeia -- the transmutation of base metals into gold -- has been pursued for millennia. While there have been small-scale demonstrations in particle accelerators and proposals involving thermal neutron capture, no economically attractive approach has yet been identified. We show a new scalable method to synthesize stable gold (\ce{^{197}Au}) from the abundant mercury isotope $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ using $(n, 2n)$ reactions in a specialized neutron multiplier layer of a fusion blanket. Reactions are driven by fast $14\, \mathrm{MeV}$ neutrons provided by a deuterium-tritium fusion plasma, which are uniquely capable of enabling the desired reaction pathway at scale. Crucially, the scheme identified here does not negatively impact electricity production, and is also compatible with the challenging tritium breeding requirements of fusion power plant design because $(n, 2n)$ reactions of $\mathrm{^{198}Hg}$ drive both transmutation and neutron multiplication. Using neutronics simulations, we demonstrate a tokamak with a blanket configuration that can produce \ mathrm{^{197}Au} at a rate of about \SI{2}{t/GW_{th}/yr}. Implementation of this concept allows fusion power plants to double the revenue generated by the system, dramatically enhancing the economic viability of fusion energy.</description>

      <title>A novel scheme for measuring the growth of Alfven wave parametric decay instability using counter-propagating waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametric decay instability (PDI) of Alfven waves -- where a pump Alfven wave decays into a backward-propagating child Alfven wave and a forward ion acoustic wave -- is a fundamental nonlinear wave-wave interaction and holds significant implications for space and laboratory plasmas. However, to date there has been no direct experimental measurement of PDI. Here, we propose a novel and experimentally viable scheme to quantify the growth of Alfven wave PDI on a linear device using a large pump Alfven wave and a small counter-propagating seed Alfven wave, with the seed wave frequency tuned to match the backward Alfven wave generated by standard PDI. Using hybrid simulations, we show that energy transfer from the pump to the seed reduces the latter's spatial damping. By comparing seed wave amplitudes with and without the pump wave, this damping reduction can be used as a direct and reliable proxy for PDI growth. The method is validated in our simulations across a range of plasma and wave parameters and agrees well with theoretical predictions. Notably, the scheme exhibits no threshold for PDI excitation and is, in principle, readily implementable under current laboratory conditions. This scheme is a critical step toward solving the challenge of experimentally accessing Alfven wave PDI and provides an elegant method that may be used to validate fundamental theories of parametric instabilities in controlled laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Multinodal Model for Plasma Particle and Energy Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized multinodal model for simulating particle and energy transport in toroidal plasma configurations, developed to support burning plasma analysis and reactor-scale modeling. Unlike fixed-node models, this formulation allows an arbitrary number of nodes, offering increased flexibility for coupling with core-edge or core-pedestal simulations. The model derives nodal balance equations for each plasma species by volume-averaging the continuity and energy conservation equations across toroidal shell nodes. Particle and energy transport terms are expressed in terms of internodal fluxes, linked to radial gradients via linear diffusion laws for particle density and temperature, respectively. The resulting transport contributions are characterized through effective particle and energy transport times, derived explicitly in terms of nodal geometry and diffusivities. This generalized framework facilitates efficient, modular implementation of radial transport dynamics in reduced-order or integrated plasma simulations, and is compatible with data-driven approaches such as NeuralPlasmaODE for model calibration and inference from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange between electrons and ions driven by ITG-TEM turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the energy exchange between electrons and ions in ITG TEM turbulence is investigated using gyrokinetic simulations. The energy exchange in TEM turbulence is primarily composed of the cooling of electrons associated with perpendicular drift and the heating of ions moving parallel to magnetic field lines. TEM turbulence facilitates energy transfer from electrons to ions, which is opposite to the direction observed in ITG turbulence. In mixed ITG TEM turbulence, the relative magnitudes of parallel heating and perpendicular cooling for each species determine the overall direction and magnitude of energy exchange. From the viewpoint of entropy balance, it is further confirmed that energy flows from the species with larger entropy production, caused by particle and heat fluxes, to the other species in ITG TEM turbulence. The predictability of turbulent energy exchange in ITG-TEM turbulence by the quasilinear model is examined. In addition, an alternative method based on the correlation between energy flux and energy exchange is developed, and its validity is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Linear mode conversion theory of radio emission from turbulent solar wind plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new theoretical and numerical model describing all possible linear interactions between upper-hybrid wave turbulence and random density fluctuations in a solar wind plasma; not only linear processes as wave reflection, refraction, scattering, tunneling, trapping, or mode conversion at constant frequency are taken into account, but also linear wave coupling, interferences between scattered waves, etc. Compact equations describing the time evolution of electromagnetic fields radiated in the $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ modes by the current due to transformations of upper-hybrid waves on density fluctuations, as well as the dispersion and polarization properties of the modes, are determined analytically and solved numerically, providing the time variations of electromagnetic energies and corresponding radiation rates. Jointly, on the basis of these numerical results that validate theoretical hypotheses, analytical calculations are conducted in the framework of weak turbulence theory extended to randomly inhomogeneous plasmas, that recover the main physical conclusions stated using the new model. The dependencies of radiation rates on plasma parameters as the magnetization, the electron thermal velocity and the average level of random density fluctuations are determined in the form of scaling laws. This work opens a new way to analyze the efficiency of electromagnetic emissions at plasma frequency by realistic wave and density turbulence spectra interacting in solar wind plasmas.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma characteristics which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.\\ Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.\\ In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>The role of three-dimensional effects on ion injection and acceleration in perpendicular shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the conditions that enable particle acceleration at non-relativistic collisionless shocks is essential to unveil the origin of cosmic rays. We employ 2D and 3D hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons) to explore particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in non-relativistic perpendicular shocks, focusing on the role of shock drift acceleration and its dependence on the shock Mach number. We perform an analysis of the ion injection process and demonstrate why efficient acceleration is only observed in 3D. In particular, we show that ion injection critically depends on the "porosity" of the magnetic turbulence in the downstream region near the shock, a property describing how easily the post-shock region allows particles to traverse it and return upstream without being trapped. This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally, we explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting how resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion gyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection. Overall, our results emphasize the necessity of high-resolution 3D simulations to capture the fundamental microphysics driving particle acceleration at perpendicular shocks.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of Non-Stationarity at Earth's Quasi-Perpendicular Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks can exhibit non-stationary behavior even under steady upstream conditions, forming a complex transition region. Ion phase-space holes, linked to shock self-reformation and surface ripples, are a signature of this non-stationarity. We statistically analyze their occurrence using 521 crossings of Earth's quasi-perpendicular bow shock. Phase-space holes appear in 65% of cases, though the actual rate may be higher as the holes may not be resolved during fast shock crossings. The occurrence rate peaks at 70% for shocks with Alfv\'en Mach numbers $M_A&gt;7$. These findings suggest that Earth's quasi-perpendicular bow shock is predominantly non-stationary.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-synchrotron Powered GeV Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.</description>

      <title>Early Prediction of Current Quench Events in the ADITYA Tokamak using Transformer based Data Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disruptions in tokamak plasmas, marked by sudden thermal and current quenches, pose serious threats to plasma-facing components and system integrity. Accurate early prediction, with sufficient lead time before disruption onset, is vital to enable effective mitigation strategies. This study presents a novel data-driven approach for predicting early current quench, a key precursor to disruptions, using transformer-based deep learning models, applied to ADITYA tokamak diagnostic data. Using multivariate time series data, the transformer model outperforms LSTM baselines across various data distributions and prediction thresholds. The transformer model achieves better recall, maintaining values above 0.9 even up to a prediction threshold of 8-10 ms, significantly outperforming LSTM in this critical metric. The proposed approach remains robust up to an 8 ms lead time, offering practical feasibility for disruption mitigation in ADITYA tokamak. In addition, a comprehensive data diversity analysis and bias sensitivity study underscore the generalization of the model. This work marks the first application of transformer architectures to ADITYA tokamak data for early current-quench prediction, establishing a promising foundation for real time disruption avoidance in short-pulse tokamaks.</description>
