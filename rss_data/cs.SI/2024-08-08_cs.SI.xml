      <title>Large-Scale Graphs Community Detection using Spark GraphFrames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of social networks, online platforms dedicated to different use cases, and sensor networks, the emergence of large-scale graph community detection has become a steady field of research with real-world applications. Community detection algorithms have numerous practical applications, particularly due to their scalability with data size. Nonetheless, a notable drawback of community detection algorithms is their computational intensity~\cite{Apostol2014}, resulting in decreasing performance as data size increases. For this purpose, new frameworks that employ distributed systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark which can seamlessly handle large-scale graphs must be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for community detection algorithms, i.e., K-Cliques, Louvain, and Fast Greedy, developed using Apache Spark GraphFrames. We test their performance and scalability on two real-world datasets. The experimental results prove the feasibility of developing graph mining algorithms using Apache Spark GraphFrames.</description>

      <title>Academic collaboration on large language model studies increases overall but varies across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for addressing complex scientific challenges. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields. To explore the application of LLMs in scientific disciplines and their implications for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze 50,391 papers from OpenAlex, an open-source platform for scholarly metadata. We first employ Shannon entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration in terms of authors' institutions and departments. Our results reveal that most fields have exhibited varying degrees of increased entropy following the release of ChatGPT, with Computer Science displaying a consistent increase. Other fields such as Social Science, Decision Science, Psychology, Engineering, Health Professions, and Business, Management &amp; Accounting have shown minor to significant increases in entropy in 2024 compared to 2023. Statistical testing further indicates that the entropy in Computer Science, Decision Science, and Engineering is significantly lower than that in health-related fields like Medicine and Biochemistry, Genetics &amp; Molecular Biology. In addition, our network analysis based on authors' affiliation information highlights the prominence of Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments in LLM research. Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, University College London, and Google are key players, either dominating centrality measures or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Semantic Graph Based Approach With Sentiment Analysis For User Interest Retrieval From Social Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blogs and social networking sites serve as a platform to the users for expressing their interests, ideas and thoughts. Targeted marketing uses the recommendation systems for suggesting their services and products to the users or clients. So the method used by target marketing is extraction of keywords and main topics from the user generated texts. Most of conventional methods involve identifying the personal interests just on the basis of surveys and rating systems. But the proposed research differs in manner that it aim at using the user generated text as a source medium for identifying and analyzing the personal interest as a knowledge base area of users. Semantic graph based approach is proposed research work that identifies the references of clients and users by analyzing their own texts such as tweets. The keywords need to be extracted from the text generated by the user on the social networking sites. This can be made possible by using several algorithms that extracts the keywords automatically from the available content provided by the user. Based on frequency and degree it ranks the extracted keywords. Furthermore, semantic graph based model assists in providing useful suggestions just by extracting the interests of users by analyzing their contents from social media. In this approach graph comprises of nodes and edges where nodes represents the keywords extracted by the algorithm and edges shows the semantic connection between the nodes. The method does not require internet related user activities like surveys or ratings to gather user interest related information.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Social Platforms Under Approximate Interference Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the total treatment effect (TTE) of a new feature in social platforms is crucial for understanding its impact on user behavior. However, the presence of network interference, which arises from user interactions, often complicates this estimation process. Experimenters typically face challenges in fully capturing the intricate structure of this interference, leading to less reliable estimates. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages surrogate networks and the pseudo inverse estimator. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We introduce the surrogate network framework, which simulates the practical situation where experimenters build an approximation of the true interference network using observable data. (2) We investigate the performance of the pseudo inverse estimator within this framework, revealing a bias-variance trade-off introduced by the surrogate network. We demonstrate a tighter asymptotic variance bound compared to previous studies and propose an enhanced variance estimator outperforming the original estimator. (3) We apply the pseudo inverse estimator to a real experiment involving over 50 million users, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting network interference when combined with the difference-in-means estimator. Our research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical literature and practical implementation, providing a solution for estimating TTE in the presence of network interference and unknown interference structures.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Diffusion for Efficient Large-Scale Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation addresses the problem of generating new graphs that have a data distribution similar to real-world graphs. While previous diffusion-based graph generation methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ARROW-Diff (AutoRegressive RandOm Walk Diffusion), a novel random walk-based diffusion approach for efficient large-scale graph generation. Our method encompasses two components in an iterative process of random walk sampling and graph pruning. We demonstrate that ARROW-Diff can scale to large graphs efficiently, surpassing other baseline methods in terms of both generation time and multiple graph statistics, reflecting the high quality of the generated graphs.</description>

      <title>FTF-ER: Feature-Topology Fusion-Based Experience Replay Method for Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual graph learning (CGL) is an important and challenging task that aims to extend static GNNs to dynamic task flow scenarios. As one of the mainstream CGL methods, the experience replay (ER) method receives widespread attention due to its superior performance. However, existing ER methods focus on identifying samples by feature significance or topological relevance, which limits their utilization of comprehensive graph data. In addition, the topology-based ER methods only consider local topological information and add neighboring nodes to the buffer, which ignores the global topological information and increases memory overhead. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel method called Feature-Topology Fusion-based Experience Replay (FTF-ER) to effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue with enhanced efficiency. Specifically, from an overall perspective to maximize the utilization of the entire graph data, we propose a highly complementary approach including both feature and global topological information, which can significantly improve the effectiveness of the sampled nodes. Moreover, to further utilize global topological information, we propose Hodge Potential Score (HPS) as a novel module to calculate the topological importance of nodes. HPS derives a global node ranking via Hodge decomposition on graphs, providing more accurate global topological information compared to neighbor sampling. By excluding neighbor sampling, HPS significantly reduces buffer storage costs for acquiring topological information and simultaneously decreases training time. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, FTF-ER achieves a significant improvement of 3.6% in AA and 7.1% in AF on the OGB-Arxiv dataset, demonstrating its superior performance in the class-incremental learning setting.</description>
