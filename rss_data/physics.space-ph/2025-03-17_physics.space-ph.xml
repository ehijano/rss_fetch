      <title>Solar Sail Momentum Management with Mass Translation and Reflectivity Devices Using MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar sails enable propellant-free space missions by utilizing solar radiation pressure as thrust. However, disturbance torques act on the solar sail and effective attitude control leads to the continuous accumulation of reaction wheel (RW) angular momentum, necessitating an efficient momentum management strategy to prevent RW saturation. This paper presents a novel momentum management controller using model predictive control (MPC) that is tailored for solar sails, accommodating the unique actuation mechanisms of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs). A first-order hold discretization and tailored motion costs are applied to the AMT translation, while the RCD actuation is handled using pulse-width modulation (PWM)-inspired quantization to address their on-off inputs. To enhance prediction accuracy, an iterative backwards-in-time MPC approach is introduced, incorporating the effects of PWM-quantized inputs into the optimization process. The dynamic model accounts for the time-dependent center of mass (CM) and moment of inertia changes caused by AMT translation, extending its applicability to other spacecraft with CM-shifting actuators. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in RW desaturation, attitude control, and momentum management actuation efficiency, highlighting the potential of integrating MPC to manage coupled nonlinear dynamics and discrete actuator constraints for solar sails.</description>

      <title>Revisiting compressible and incompressible pressure-strain interaction in kinetic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the pressure-strain interaction in kinetic turbulence, and in particular we re-examine the decomposition of pressure-strain interaction into compressive and incompressive parts. The pressure dilatation ingredient is clearly due to plasma compressions, but here using kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of plasma turbulence, it is demonstrated that the remaining anisotropic part, often called Pi-D, also contains contributions due to compressive, non solenoidal velocities of the particle species. The compressive Pi-D can play a significant role in systems with low plasma $\beta$ even if the system starts with small density variations. The compressive ingredient of Pi-D is found to be anticorrelated with both incompressive Pi-D and pressure dilatation.</description>

      <title>A magnetic avalanche as the central engine powering a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are the most powerful, magnetically-driven, explosions in the heliosphere. The nature of magnetic energy release in the solar corona that heats the plasma and accelerates particles in a flare, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we report high-resolution coronal observations of a flare (SOL2024-09-30T23:47) by the Solar Orbiter mission that reveal initially weaker but rapid reconnection events, on timescales of at most a few seconds, leading to a more prominent activity of similar nature that explosively cause a flare. Signatures of this process are further imprinted on the widespread raining plasma blobs with short lifetimes, giving rise to the characteristic ribbon-like emission pattern associated with the flare. Our novel observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasize the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Inverse Velocity Dispersion in a Solar Energetic Particle Event Observed by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) events, characterized by higher-energy particles arriving later than lower-energy particles, challenge the classical understanding of SEP events and are increasingly observed by spacecraft, such as Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO). However, the mechanisms underlying IVD events remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the physical processes responsible for long-duration IVD events by analyzing the SEP event observed by SolO on 2022 June 7. We explore the role of evolving shock connectivity, particle acceleration at interplanetary (IP) shocks, and cross-field transport in shaping the observed particle profiles.We utilize data from Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) suite onboard SolO to analyze the characteristics of the IVD, and model the event using the Heliospheric Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport (HEPAT) model. The IVD event exhibited a distinct and long-duration IVD signature, across proton energies from 1 to 20 MeV and lasting for approximately 10 hours. Simulations suggest that evolving shock connectivity and the evolution of shock play a primary role in the IVD signature, with SolO transitioning from shock flank to nose over time, resulting in a gradual increase in maximum particle energy along the field line. Furthermore, model results show that limited cross-field diffusion can influence both the nose energy and the duration of the IVD event. This study demonstrates that long-duration IVD events are primarily driven by evolving magnetic connectivity along a non-uniform shock that evolves over time, where the connection moves to more efficient acceleration sites as the shock propagates farther from the Sun. Other mechanisms, such as acceleration time at the shock, may also contribute to the observed IVD features.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>The Solar Enigma Decoding the Mystery of the Hot Corona and Solar Wind Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.10326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sun's corona, heated to temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin despite lying above the cooler photosphere, has puzzled astrophysicists since its discovery in the 1940s. Prevailing theories, based on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, and micro/nano-flares, fail to fully account for this extreme heating or the origins of the supersonic solar wind. We propose a mechanism in which magnetic reconnection rapidly reconfigures field lines and exerts a torque on the magnetic moment of gyrating charged particles. This torque transfers magnetic energy to the particles, effectively doubling their energy and heating the plasma. As particles traverse multiple reconnection sites, they gradually heat to coronal temperatures. With just a few additional crossings, particles can gain enough energy to overcome the Sun's gravity, directly driving solar wind acceleration. Our hypothesis resolves the coronal heating paradox and unifies solar wind dynamics under a universal astrophysical process. This work redefines our understanding of energy transfer in magnetized plasmas, with implications extending to stellar and astrophysical systems.</description>
