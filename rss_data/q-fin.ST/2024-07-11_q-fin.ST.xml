      <title>Multiple split approach -- multidimensional probabilistic forecasting of electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a multiple split method is proposed that enables construction of multidimensional probabilistic forecasts of a selected set of variables. The method uses repeated resampling to estimate uncertainty of simultaneous multivariate predictions. This nonparametric approach links the gap between point and probabilistic predictions and can be combined with different point forecasting methods. The performance of the method is evaluated with data describing the German short-term electricity market. The results show that the proposed approach provides highly accurate predictions. The gains from multidimensional forecasting are the largest when functions of variables, such as price spread or residual load, are considered.
  Finally, the method is used to support a decision process of a moderate generation utility that produces electricity from wind energy and sells it on either a day-ahead or an intraday market. The company makes decisions under high uncertainty because it knows neither the future production level nor the prices. We show that joint forecasting of both market prices and fundamentals can be used to predict the distribution of a profit, and hence helps to design a strategy that balances a level of income and a trading risk.</description>

      <title>Trade When Opportunity Comes: Price Movement Forecasting via Locality-Aware Attention and Iterative Refinement Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.11972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Price movement forecasting, aimed at predicting financial asset trends based on current market information, has achieved promising advancements through machine learning (ML) methods. Most existing ML methods, however, struggle with the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data, often mistaking noises for real trading signals without careful selection of potentially profitable samples. To address this issue, we propose LARA, a novel price movement forecasting framework with two main components: Locality-Aware Attention (LA-Attention) and Iterative Refinement Labeling (RA-Labeling). (1) LA-Attention, enhanced by metric learning techniques, automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples through masked attention scheme and task-specific distance metrics. (2) RA-Labeling further iteratively refines the noisy labels of potentially profitable samples, and combines the learned predictors robust to the unseen and noisy samples. In a set of experiments on three real-world financial markets: stocks, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs, LARA significantly outperforms several machine learning based methods on the Qlib quantitative investment platform. Extensive ablation studies confirm LARA's superior ability in capturing more reliable trading opportunities.</description>

      <title>Downside Risk Reduction Using Regime-Switching Signals: A Statistical Jump Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a regime-switching investment strategy aimed at mitigating downside risk by reducing market exposure during anticipated unfavorable market regimes. We highlight the statistical jump model (JM) for market regime identification, a recently developed robust model that distinguishes itself from traditional Markov-switching models by enhancing regime persistence through a jump penalty applied at each state transition. Our JM utilizes a feature set comprising risk and return measures derived solely from the return series, with the optimal jump penalty selected through a time-series cross-validation method that directly optimizes strategy performance. Our empirical analysis evaluates the realistic out-of-sample performance of various strategies on major equity indices from the US, Germany, and Japan from 1990 to 2023, in the presence of transaction costs and trading delays. The results demonstrate the consistent outperformance of the JM-guided strategy in reducing risk metrics such as volatility and maximum drawdown, and enhancing risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio, when compared to both hidden Markov model-guided strategy and the buy-and-hold strategy. These findings underline the enhanced persistence, practicality, and versatility of strategies utilizing JMs for regime-switching signals.</description>
