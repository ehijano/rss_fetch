      <title>$G_\delta$ Circle Squaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a circle and square of the same area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are equidecomposable by translations using $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_2$ pieces. That is, pieces which are simultaneously $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ sets. This improves a result of M\'ath\'e-Noel-Pikhurko and is the best possible complexity in terms of the Borel hierarchy. More generally we show that bounded sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with small enough boundaries and the same nonzero Lebesgue measure are equidecomposable with pieces that are countable unions of finite Boolean combinations of translates of $A,B$, and open sets. The improvement comes from constructions of low complexity toasts and related objects which should be independently useful within Borel combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Borel Homomorphisms from Forests to Kneser Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer a recent question of Cs\'oka and Vidny\'anszky [arXiv:2407.10006] and give an alternate proof of one of their results. The subject of both is which finite graphs admit factor of i.i.d. homomorphisms from the 3-regular tree. We then give yet another proof of the result in the Borel setting which leads to the following: For each $d &gt; 2$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a Borel hyperfinite $d$-regular forest $G$ and a finite graph with chromatic number $k$, $H$, so that $G$ does not admit a Borel homomorphism to $H$. All of this is tied together by a focus on the case when the target graph $H$ is a (subgraph of a) Kneser graph.</description>

      <title>LCLs in the Borel Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) on a group $\Gamma$ asks one to find a labeling of the Cayley graph of $\Gamma$ satisfying a fixed, finite set of "local" constraints. Typical examples include proper coloring and perfect matching problems. In descriptive combinatorics, one often considers the existence of solutions to LCLs in the setting of descriptive set theory. For example, given a free action of $\Gamma$ on a Polish space $X$, we might be interested in solving a given LCL on each orbit in a continuous, Borel, measurable, etc. way.
  In an attempt to understand more finely the gap between Borel and continuous combinatorics, we consider the existence of Baire class $m$ solutions to LCLs. For all $n &gt; 1$ and $m \in \omega$, we produce an LCL on $\mathbb{F}_n$ which always admits Baire class $m+1$ solutions, but not necessarily Baire class $m$ solutions.</description>

      <title>Dismantling the Surprise Test "Paradox"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following story: A teacher announces to her students a test for the following week, such that the test will be ``surprising''. The students use this as the basis for a ``logical derivation'' and reach a contradiction, which they (falsely) interpret as saying that there cannot be a test. The teacher gives a test e.g. on Wednesday, ``surprising'' the students. Its curious turns give the story the flavor of a paradox. Alternative names are the {\it unexpected hanging paradox\/} and the {\it prediction paradox}. Discussions and analyses of the story in the philosophical and mathematical literature are abundant, spanning 80 years until today. Apparently, none of the known explanations has been generally accepted as conclusive. We offer a fresh view, in propositional logic. ``Surprise'' is captured as unprovability of a certain formula from some axiom system. ``Knowledge'' corresponds to axiom systems and can be gained by mathematical proofs. The notorious property of self-reference in the announcement is cleanly accommodated. All errors made by the students are identified. A general analysis shows that the students cannot learn anything from the announcement. This is the first mathematically precise analysis of the story that shows that self-reference, full power of mathematical proofs, and truthfulness of the teacher can consistently coexist. The ``paradox'' vanishes. In order to facilitate comparisons with treatments using modal logic a version based on system S5 is also given. A formula $\sigma$ is identified that formalizes ``there will be a surprising test'', and it is shown that the students take the announcement to mean $\square\sigma$ while in fact the information conveyed by it is not stronger than $\diamond\sigma$. This dissolves all contradictions or ``paradoxical'' issues.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Three Topics in Non-decomposability of Generalized Multiplicative Connectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.08187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Danos and Regnier introduced generalized (non-binary) multiplicative connectives in Danos and Regnier [2]. They showed that there exist generalized multiplicative connectives that cannot be defined by any combination of the tensor and par rules in the multiplicative fragment of linear logic. Such connectives are called non-decomposable generalized multiplicative connectives [2, p.192]. The non-decomposability of logical connectives can be regarded as a proof-theoretic and syntactic counterpart of functional completeness for cut-free proofs. In this short note, we investigate Danos and Regnier's notion of non-decomposability and present three results concerning the (non-)decomposability of generalized multiplicative connectives.</description>

      <title>Deducibility of Identicals, Reflection Principle and Synthetic Connectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05120v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sambin et al. (2000) introduced Basic Logic as a uniform framework for various logics. At the same time, they also introduced the principle of reflection as a criterion for being a connective in Basic Logic. In this paper, we make explicit the relationship between Hacking's deducibility of identicals condition (Hacking, 1979) and the principle of reflection by proving their equivalence. Moreover, despite Sambin et al.'s conjecture that only six connectives satisfy the principle of reflection, we show that a logical connective satisfies the principle of reflection if and only if it is Girard's synthetic connective.</description>

      <title>Strictly Monotone Numerosity on Tame Sets via the Steiner Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses inspiration from Integral Geometry to connect Tame Geometry with Nonstandard Analysis. We omit binomial coefficients from the Steiner polynomial to define the \textit{intrinsic volume polynomial} $\Phi$, a valuation defined on bounded definable sets in an o-minimal structure. We prove that using this normalization gives a strictly monotone valuation on point sets when the codomain $\mathbb{R}[t]$ is interpreted with ordering by end behavior. This leads to an algebraic version of Hadwiger's Theorem: $\Phi$ is the unique conormal continuous, similarity-equivariant homomorphism of ordered rings from $\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^\infty) \to \mathbb{R}[t]$ (up to scaling). Noting that strict monotonicity is mirrored in numerosity theory (a branch of nonstandard analysis), we prove existence for a numerosity that exceptionally approximates the intrinsic volume polynomial. This suggests a connection between disparate fields, allowing each to complement the other.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Primality in Bounded Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the correctness of the AKS algorithm \cite{AKS} within the bounded arithmetic theory $T^{count}_2$ or, equivalently, the first-order consequences of the theory $VTC^0$ expanded by the smash function, which we denote by $VTC^0_2$. Our approach initially demonstrates the correctness within the theory $S^1_2 + iWPHP$ augmented by two algebraic axioms and then show that they are provable in $VTC^0_2$. The two axioms are: a generalized version of Fermat's Little Theorem and an axiom adding a new function symbol which injectively maps roots of polynomials over a definable finite field to numbers bounded by the degree of the given polynomial. To obtain our main result, we also give new formalizations of parts of number theory and algebra:
  $\bullet$ In $PV_1$: We formalize Legendre's Formula on the prime factorization of $n!$, key properties of the Combinatorial Number System and the existence of cyclotomic polynomials over the finite fields $\mathbb{Z}/p$.
  $\bullet$ In $S^1_2$: We prove the inequality $lcm(1,\dots, 2n) \geq 2^n$.
  $\bullet$ In $VTC^0$: We verify the correctness of the Kung--Sieveking algorithm for polynomial division.</description>

      <title>Complexity of deep computations via topology of function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use topological methods to study complexity of deep computations and limit computations. We use topology of function spaces, specifically, the classification Rosenthal compacta, to identify new complexity classes. We use the language of model theory, specifically, the concept of \emph{independence} from Shelah's classification theory, to translate between topology and computation. We use the theory of Rosenthal compacta to characterize approximablility of deep computations, both deterministically and probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Polynomial definability in constraint languages with few subpowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A first-order formula is called primitive positive (pp) if it only admits the use of existential quantifiers and conjunction. Pp-formulas are a central concept in (fixed-template) constraint satisfaction since CSP($\Gamma$) can be viewed as the problem of deciding the primitive positive theory of $\Gamma$, and pp-definability captures gadget reductions between CSPs.
  An important class of tractable constraint languages $\Gamma$ is characterized by having few subpowers, that is, the number of $n$-ary relations pp-definable from $\Gamma$ is bounded by $2^{p(n)}$ for some polynomial $p(n)$. In this paper we study a restriction of this property, stating that every pp-definable relation is definable by a pp-formula of polynomial length. We conjecture that the existence of such short definitions is actually equivalent to $\Gamma$ having few subpowers, and verify this conjecture for a large subclass that, in particular, includes all constraint languages on three-element domains. We furthermore discuss how our conjecture imposes an upper complexity bound of co-NP on the subpower membership problem of algebras with few subpowers.</description>
