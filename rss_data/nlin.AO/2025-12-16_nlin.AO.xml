      <title>Model for self-organized Leidenfrost rotating polygons as cnoidal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable appearance of self-organized regular and peaked polygonal rotating patterns in shallow Leidenfrost rings is investigated as a balance between surface tension geometry and nonlinear terms of Euler equation. Using the Boussinesq shallow convection approximation and a specialized expansion of the Laplace equation solutions, we derive a nonlinear equation that can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions. The model rigorously accounts for surface tension, the contribution of the poloidal rolling vortex, and the interplay between buoyancy-driven and thermocapillary flows. We obtain cnoidal waves solutions describing the dynamics of the inner free surface of the Leidenfrost ring, to predict polygonal patterns in liquid nitrogen. These predictions are compared with experimental observations.Additionally, we introduce a simplified model based on poloidal averaging of the capillary pressure, leading to a Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. This simplified model not only reproduces the cnoidal wave solutions but also predicts new trigonometric solutions, offering insights into the formation of peaked polygons.</description>

      <title>A Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Machine -- A Theory for a Novel Type of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a Unique Dissipative System and one Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on an interesting dissipative system found in a photonics system. In this dissipative system, we theoretically identified that robust causality is generated and as a result, it becomes possible to produce behavior that can be understood as SSB, and, we experimentally demonstrated this finding. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrated that by combining such dissipative systems as fundamental elements and establishing a certain relationship between them through optical interference, it is possible to create a unique system that generates complex SSB as a whole. This unique SSB can be understood as having a duality with the model of the creation of many-body-like system (MBLS), and by using the correspondence between the many-body-like system and the Ising model, it holds promise as an alternative computational resource for solving combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>A self-organized compression network arrests epithelial proliferation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Bimodal Amplitude Patterns in Heterogeneous Oscillatory Media -- Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an intricate mechanism of pattern formation in globally coupled heterogeneous oscillatory media. In anodic electrochemical etching of silicon, the electrode surface splits into two amplitude-phase regions, while all oscillators remain frequency-locked. Additionally, the relative ratio of the pattern can be tuned via a coupling term. We introduce a heterogeneous, complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with global coupling to reproduce these patterns and study their formation. Neglecting diffusion shows that frequency entrainment arises from amplitude adaptation. Diffusion, on the other hand, enforces the selection of a unique cluster ratio. In quantitative agreement with simulations, a center-manifold reduction yields a Lyapunov functional that predicts the selected ratio. Both of these results establish a theoretical framework that connects experiment and theory. Moreover, they show how heterogeneity and diffusion convert degenerate cluster dynamics into robust pattern selection.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>
