      <description>arXiv:2408.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study the special fractional-order Chen-Lee system, using the Caputo fractional derivatives.

      <title>Data-driven identification of latent port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g., time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>The Moduli Stack of Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Dyck's Surface, which is the connected sum of three projective planes, is a fine moduli stack of possibly-degenerate similarity classes of triangles, where degeneracy is defined broadly to be compatible with the metric closures of known constructions of nondegenerate spaces, which are based on either side-side-side or angle-angle-angle criteria. We also prove the blowup of $\mathbb C^3-\{0\}$ at three hyperplanes is a fine moduli stack of possibly-degenerate triangles, also using the broadest reasonable definition of degeneracy.</description>

      <title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>Absence of Closed-Form Descriptions for Gradient Flow in Two-Layer Narrow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning, comprehending the intricate training dynamics of neural networks poses a significant challenge. This paper explores the training dynamics of neural networks, particularly whether these dynamics can be expressed in a general closed-form solution. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the gradient flow in two-layer narrow networks is not an integrable system. Integrable systems are characterized by trajectories confined to submanifolds defined by level sets of first integrals (invariants), facilitating predictable and reducible dynamics. In contrast, non-integrable systems exhibit complex behaviors that are difficult to predict. To establish the non-integrability, we employ differential Galois theory, which focuses on the solvability of linear differential equations. We demonstrate that under mild conditions, the identity component of the differential Galois group of the variational equations of the gradient flow is non-solvable. This result confirms the system's non-integrability and implies that the training dynamics cannot be represented by Liouvillian functions, precluding a closed-form solution for describing these dynamics. Our findings highlight the necessity of employing numerical methods to tackle optimization problems within neural networks. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network training dynamics and their implications for machine learning optimization strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two papers published in 1979, R. Bowen and C. Series defined a dynamical system from a Fuchsian group, acting on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. The dynamics is given by a map on $S^1$ which is, in particular, an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of the circle. In this paper we consider a reverse question: which dynamical conditions for an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of $S^1$ are sufficient for the map to be a ``Bowen-Series-type" map (see below) for some group $G$ and which groups can occur? We give a partial answer to these questions.</description>

      <title>Incorporating changeable attitudes toward vaccination into an SIR infectious disease model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mechanistic model that classifies individuals both in terms of epidemiological status (SIR) and vaccination attitude (willing or unwilling), with the goal of discovering how disease spread is influenced by changing opinions about vaccination. Analysis of the model identifies existence and stability criteria for both disease-free and endemic disease equilibria. The analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, show that attitude changes induced by disease prevalence can destabilize endemic disease equilibria, resulting in limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion \mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t, X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t, X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t), where A is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H}, coefficients f and g are Poisson stable in time, and B^H_Q (t) is a Q-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index H. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f and g are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: a set representation suitable for unbounded systems and its application to set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis of descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). In contrast to intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, linear static constraints on the state variables, typical of descriptor systems, can be directly incorporated in the mathematical description of constrained zonotopes (CZs). Thanks to this feature, methods using CZs could provide less conservative enclosures than zonotope methods. However, an enclosure on the states should be known for all $k \geq 0$, which is not true in the case of unstable or unobservable LDS. In this context, this paper proposes a new representation for unbounded sets, which allows to develop methods for state estimation and AFD of stable and unstable LDS. Unlike many other extensions of CZs, the proposed set inherits most of their properties, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while allowing to describe different classes of sets, such as strips, hyperplanes, and the entire $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The advantages of the proposed approaches with respect to CZ methods are highlighted in numerical examples.</description>
