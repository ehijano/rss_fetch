      <title>Electric and Magnetic Field-dependent Tunneling between Coupled Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron systems host rich emergent physics that cannot be accounted for by understanding isolated 1D electron systems alone. Open questions remain about how transport in these arrays can be manipulated by the application of external electric and magnetic fields. In this theoretical study, we consider a pair of coupled nanowires with non-interacting electrons. We find that a metal-insulator transition is induced by an out-of-plane magnetic field and a transverse potential bias on an array of such coupled wires. We demonstrate the existence of distinct conductance features and highlight the crucial role played by the field dependence of the interwire potential barrier on transport properties. These predictions agree well with transport experiments performed on coupled nanowires sketched on an LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. Since our model makes minimal assumptions, we expect our predictions to hold for a wide class of coupled 1D systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Tuned Metal-Insulator Transition in LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide family of two dimensional (2D) systems, including stripe-phase superconductors, sliding Luttinger liquids, and anisotropic 2D materials, can be modeled by an array of coupled one-dimensional (1D) electron channels or nanowire arrays. Here we report experiments in arrays of conducting nanowires with gate and field tunable interwire coupling, that are programmed at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Charge-density-wave control by adatom manipulation and its effect on magnetic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-density waves (CDWs) are correlated states of matter, where the electronic density is modulated periodically as a consequence of electronic and phononic interactions. Often, CDW phases coexist with other correlated states, such as superconductivity, spin-density waves or Mott insulators. Controlling CDW phases may therefore enable the manipulation of the energy landscape of these interacting states. 2H-NbSe$_2$ is a prime example of a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) hosting CDW order and superconductivity. The CDW is of incommensurate nature resulting in different CDW-to-lattice alignments at the atomic scale. Here, we use the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to position adatoms on the surface and induce reversible switching of the CDW domains. We show that the domain structure critically affects other local interactions, namely the hybridization of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which arise from exchange interactions of magnetic Fe atoms with the superconductor. Our results suggest that CDW manipulation could also be used to introduce domain walls in coupled spin chains on superconductors, potentially also affecting topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Fast response and highly sensitive flexible humidity sensor based on nanocomposite film of MoS2 and graphene oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO)-based humidity sensors are attracting widespread attention due to their high responsivity and low cost. However, GO-based humidity sensors generally suffer from slow response and recovery as well as poor stability,etc. Here, we reported a flexible resistive humidity sensor based on a MoS2/GO composite film that was fabricated by mixing different volumes of MoS2 and GO dispersions with adjustable volume ratios. The MoS2/GO composite film has been used as a sensing layer on screen-printed interdigital electrodes. The results show that the best device performance was achieved at a dispersion volume of 0.05 mL with the MoS2/GO volume ratio of 5:1, featuring high responsivity (~98%), fast response/recovery time (1.3/12.1 s), excellent stability and low cost. Further, the humidity sensor exhibits good linearity over a wide humidity range (33% RH-98% RH) at room temperature and can be fabricated easily and feasibly. The application of the humidity sensors we prepared in human respiration detection and human fingertip proximity detection has been demonstrated. These findings indicate the great potential of the composite of MoS2/GO in developing the next generation of high-performance humidity sensors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the 5G era means that the concepts of robot, VR/AR, UAV, smart home, smart healthcare based on IoT (Internet of Things) have gradually entered human life. Since then, intelligent life has become the dominant direction of social development. Humidity sensors, as humidity detection tools, not only convey the comfort of human living environment, but also display great significance in the fields of meteorology, medicine, agriculture and industry. Graphene-based materials exhibit tremendous potential in humidity sensing owing to their ultra-high specific surface area and excellent electron mobility under room temperature for application in humidity sensing. This review begins with the introduction of examples of various synthesis strategies of graphene, followed by the device structure and working mechanism of graphene-based humidity sensor. In addition, several different structural design methods of graphene are summarized, demonstrating the structural design of graphene can not only optimize the performance of graphene, but also bring significant advantages in humidity sensing. Finally, key challenges hindering the further development and practical application of high-performance graphene-based humidity sensors are discussed, followed by presenting the future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Graphene-Based Pressure Sensors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, pressure sensors have been widely used as crucial technology components in industrial, healthcare, consumer electronics, and automotive safety applications. With the development of intelligent technologies, there is a growing demand for pressure sensors with higher sensitivity, smaller size, and wider detection range. Graphene and its derivatives, as novel emerging materials in recent years, have received widespread attention from researchers due to their unique mechanical and electrical properties, and are considered as promising sensing materials for the high-performance pressure sensors. In general, graphene-based pressure sensors can be classified into flexible pressure sensors and gas pressure sensors. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic properties of graphene and its derivatives and then review the research progress of both graphene-based flexible pressure sensors and graphene-based gas pressure sensors respectively, focusing on different sensing mechanisms. Finally, the application prospects of graphene-based pressure sensors as well as future challenges are discussed.</description>

      <title>Combining multiplexed gate-based readout and isolated CMOS quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot arrays are a promising platform to perform spin-based error-corrected quantum computation with large numbers of qubits. However, due to the diverging number of possible charge configurations combined with the limited sensitivity of large-footprint charge sensors, achieving single-spin occupancy in each dot in a growing quantum dot array is exceedingly complex. Therefore, to scale-up a spin-based architecture we must change how individual charges are readout and controlled. Here, we demonstrate single-spin occupancy of each dot in a foundry-fabricated array by combining two methods. 1/ Loading a finite number of electrons into the quantum dot array; simplifying electrostatic tuning by isolating the array from the reservoirs. 2/ Deploying multiplex gate-based reflectometry to dispersively probe charge tunneling and spin states without charge sensors or reservoirs. Our isolated arrays probed by embedded multiplex readout can be readily electrostatically tuned. They are thus a viable, scalable approach for spin-based quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless transport signature of topological nodal lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological materials, such as topological insulators or semimetals, usually not only reveal the nontrivial properties of their electronic wavefunctions through the appearance of stable boundary modes, but also through very specific electromagnetic responses. The anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance of Weyl semimetals, for instance, carries the signature of the chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions. However for topological nodal line semimetals -- materials where the valence and conduction bands cross each other on one-dimensional curves in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone -- such a characteristic has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of a peculiar charge transport effect generated by topological nodal lines: a dissipationless transverse signal in the presence of coplanar electric and magnetic fields, which originates from a Zeeman-induced conversion of topological nodal lines into Weyl nodes under infinitesimally small magnetic fields. We evidence this dissipationless topological response in trigonal \ce{PtBi2} persisting up to room temperature, and unveil the extensive topological nodal lines in the band structure of this non-magnetic material. These findings provide a new pathway to engineer Weyl nodes by arbitrary small magnetic fields and reveal that bulk topological nodal lines can exhibit non-dissipative transport properties.</description>

      <title>Theory of atomic-scale direct thermometry using ESR-STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the occupation ratio and the energy splitting of a two-level system yields a direct readout of its temperature. Based on this principle, the determination of the temperature of an individual two-level magnetic atom was demonstrated using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) via Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (ESR-STM). The temperature determination proceeds in two steps. First, energy splitting is determined using ESR-STM. Second, the equilibrium occupation of the two-level atom is determined in a resonance experiment of a second nearby atom, that has now two different resonant peaks, associated to the two states of the magnetic two-level atom. The ratio of the heights of its resonance peaks yields the occupation ratio. Here we present theory work to address three key aspects: first, we find how shot-noise and back-action limit the precision of this thermometry method; second, we study how the geometry of the nearby spins can be used to enhance signal-to-noise ratio. We predict ESR-STM thermometry can achieve a resolution of 10 mK using temperatures in the T= 1K range. Third, we show how ESR-STM thermometry can be used to detect thermal gradients as small as 5 mK/nm.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of Quantum Hall states for filling factors 1 &lt; v &lt; 2 measured with microcavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin polarization measurements were performed in three 2D Electron Gases in GaAs with densities n = 9.1, 7.2 and 6.5 x10^10 cm-2, in the quantum Hall regime. Full spin polarization at v = 1 surrounded by rapid depolarization due to Skyrmion formation was observed in all devices, consistent with past measurements. Depolarization of the v = 4/3, 8/5 states and repolarization of the v = 5/3 state was also measured, in remarkable agreement with a non-interacting, disorder-free Composite Fermion model. Optical power and temperature dependent measurements of the v = 1 state suggest a regime of non-linear optics.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the antiferromagnetic spin Seebeck effect through topological magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnons emerge as topologically protected spin wave states at the edges of magnets. Here, we theoretically explore how these surface states can be harnessed to amplify the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in antiferromagnets (AFMs) interfaced with normal metals (NMs). Based on a microscopic model of a kagome AFM, we demonstrate that broken mirror symmetry, combined with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), drives the system into a topological phase hosting spin-polarized magnons at the boundaries. Notably, linear response calculations reveal that in AFM/NM heterostructures, the topological magnons exhibit strong coupling to the metal's charge carriers, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the SSE. The relative contribution of the topological magnons is found to be 4-5 times greater than that of the trivial magnon bands. Moreover, our results show that this enhancement is highly sensitive to the strength of the DMI.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Rashba fermions and quantum valley Hall insulators in graphene-based 2D heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is highly desirable to modify and improve the Dirac electron system of graphene for novel electronic properties and promising applications. For this purpose, we study 2D heterostructures consisting of graphene and monolayer TMDs by means of first-principles calculation and effective low-energy hamiltonian model. We determine the model parameters by fitting with the first-prinples bands. MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ are chosen in order to align the Dirac cones of graphene with the intrinsic Fermi levels of the TMDs. It is found that the Dirac energy bands of graphene are modified, but the linear band dispersion near the cones is kept. It is shown that the effective low-energy model hosts Dirac-Rashba feimions in the WSe$_2$/graphene and MoSe$_2$/graphene/WSe$_2$, and there is quantum valley Hall effect in these graphene-based 2D heterostructures. Our further analyses indicate that there are strong interactions between the orbitals and spins especially near the K and K' points. These can be useful in further exploration for novel properties and more functionalities in 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Hidden anisotropy controls spin-photon entanglement in a charged quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon entanglement is indispensable for optical quantum technologies. Measurement-based optical quantum computing and all-optical quantum networks rely on multiphoton cluster states consisting of indistinguishable entangled photons. A promising method for creating such cluster states on demand is spin-photon entanglement using the spin of a resident charge carrier in a quantum dot, precessing in a weak external magnetic field. In this work, we show theoretically and experimentally that spin-photon entanglement is strongly affected by the hidden anisotropy of quantum dots, which can arise from mechanical stress, shape anisotropy and even specific crystal structure. In the measurements of time-resolved photoluminescence and cross-polarized second-order photon correlation function in a magnetic field, the anisotropy manifests itself in the spin dynamics and, as a consequence, in the spin-photon concurrence. The measured time-filtered spin-photon Bell state fidelity depends strongly on the excitation polarization and reaches an extremely high value of 94% at maximum. We specify the magnetic field and excitation polarization directions that maximize spin-photon entanglement and thereby enhance the fidelity of multiphoton entangled states.</description>

      <title>On the origin of anomalous hysteresis in graphite/boron nitride transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-effect devices constructed by stacking flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials, with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) playing the role of gate dielectric, often exhibit virtually no hysteresis in their characteristics. This permits exquisitely detailed studies of diverse gate-voltage-tuned phenomena in vdW devices. Recently, however, a dramatic form of gate hysteresis, sometimes called the "gate doesn't work" (GDW) or "electron ratchet" effect, has been seen in certain individual vdW devices that seem otherwise unexceptional. When it occurs, this hysteresis phenomenon is striking and robust, yet it is difficult to reliably reproduce between devices and, largely as a result, its origin remains disputed. Most devices where it has been seen have a bilayer graphene channel and nominal rotational alignment between the graphene and hBN, which has engendered explanations based on properties of bilayer graphene combined with moir\'e effects. Here, we report our studies of the phenomenon observed in devices that have multilayer graphene channels. We find that the effect can occur in devices with graphite channels that have many more than two graphene layers, in which case it is unambiguously associated with just one surface of the graphite. It can also survive to room temperature, occur in the absence of intentional rotational alignment with hBN, persist when a monolayer of WSe2 is inserted between the graphene and hBN, and exhibit continuous relaxation on timescales of hours or longer. These observations impose strong constraints on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon, which has exciting potential applications if it can be mastered.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Local-Resonance Induced Complex Band Hybridization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complex band hybridization induced by nonreciprocal local resonances in photonic crystals. Composed of trimer unit cells, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetophotonic crystal with an analytically obtainable solution is considered. We find that nonreciprocal spectral gap may appear without nonreciprocal transmission and that the imaginary parts of the complex wavevectors $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ may blow up at resonance to give extreme nonreciprocal transmission. We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Transition-Edge Sensors with Scanning SQUID Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in understanding the physics of transition-edge sensors (TESs) over the past decade. However, key questions remain, particularly a detailed understanding of the current-dependent resistance of these detectors when biased within their superconducting transition. We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy (SSM) to image the local diamagnetic response of aluminum-manganese alloy (Al-Mn) transition-edge sensors (TESs) near their critical temperature of approximately 175 mK. By doing so, we gain insights into how the device dimensions influence TES transition width, which in turn affects device operation and informs optimal device design. Our images reveal that the Al-Mn thin film near the niobium (Nb) leads exhibits an excess diamagnetic response at temperatures several milli-Kelvin (mK) higher than the bulk of the film farther from the contacts. A possible origin of this behavior is a longitudinal proximity effect between the Nb and Al-Mn where the TES acts as a weak link between superconducting leads. We discuss how this effect shapes the temperature dependence of the resistance as the spacing between the leads decreases. This work demonstrates that magnetic imaging with SSM is a powerful tool for local characterization of superconducting detectors.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of SnSe nanoflakes by AFM-based Scanning Thermal Microscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the thermal resistance of SnSe nanoflakes using scanning thermal microscopy, an extension of atomic force microscopy that allows for nanoscale thermal mapping. The nanoflakes studied ranged in thickness from 5 nm to 40 nm, enabling us to observe the thermal properties across a wide range of dimensions. Our results show a clear trend: as the thickness of the nanoflakes increases, the thermal resistance also increases. This suggests that diffusive mechanisms govern heat transport in SnSe nanoflakes and follow Fourier's law of heat conduction. The observed behavior can be attributed to the inherently short phonon mean free path in SnSe which is on the order of 5 nm at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity and symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz reciprocity is a fundamental property in electromagnetism and well known to break down due to an external magnetic field. With a fictitious or imaginary vector potential, however, its behavior is largely unknown. Here we show that in systems with an imaginary vector potential and displaying the non-Hermitian skin effect, the Lorentz reciprocity is broken but still governed by a rigorous mathematical relation, which we term non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity. When mimicking an imaginary vector potential using just linear integrated photonic elements, however, the conditions that lead to the Lorentz reciprocity are still satisfied and hence the latter cannot be broken. Nevertheless, we show that the non-Hermitian gauged reciprocity can still be observed with a proper choice of inputs and outputs, alongside the Lorentz reciprocity. In addition, we also reveal another equal-amplitude response in the same system, which we attribute to a non-Hermitian gauged symmetry. Furthermore, we show that light propagation is not impinged by the non-Hermitian topological funnel effect, highlighting an underappreciated difference between coherently driven and non-driven systems. These findings are confirmed using a tight-binding model and full-wave simulations of coupled optical micro-ring resonators, providing a valuable extension of the Lorentz reciprocity in the non-Hermitian domain.</description>

      <title>Strongly Enhanced Electronic Bandstructure Renormalization by Light in Nanoscale Strained Regions of Monolayer MoS$_2$/Au(111) Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the photoexcited quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides lays the foundation for exploring the strongly interacting, non-equilibrium 2D quasiparticle and polaritonic states in these quantum materials and for harnessing the properties emerging from these states for optoelectronic applications. In this study, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with light illumination at the tunneling junction is performed to investigate the QP dynamics in monolayer MoS$_2$ on an Au(111) substrate with nanoscale corrugations. The corrugations on the surface of the substrate induce nanoscale local strain in the overlaying monolayer MoS$_2$ single crystal, which result in energetically favorable spatial regions where photoexcited QPs, including excitons, trions, and electron-hole plasmas, accumulate. These strained regions exhibit pronounced electronic bandstructure renormalization as a function of the photoexcitation wavelength and intensity as well as the strain gradient, implying strong interplay among nanoscale structures, strain, and photoexcited QPs. In conjunction with the experimental work, we construct a theoretical framework that integrates non-uniform nanoscale strain into the electronic bandstructure of a monolayer MoS$_2$ lattice using a tight-binding approach combined with first-principle calculations. This methodology enables better understanding of the experimental observation of photoexcited QP localization in the nanoscale strain-modulated electronic bandstructure landscape. Our findings illustrate the feasibility of utilizing nanoscale architectures and optical excitations to manipulate the local electronic bandstructure of monolayer TMDs and to enhance the many-body interactions of excitons, which is promising for the development of nanoscale energy-adjustable optoelectronic and photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Higher signals without compromising the electron beam coherence can be achieved by enhanced duty cycles, thus far limited to few-kHz repetition rates by the cooling times in thin-film specimens. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to accommodate rapid thermal relaxation. A charge-density wave (CDW) phase transformation allows us to quantify the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the thermal relaxation of different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to \SI{200}{\micro\watt\per\um^2} within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of \SI{2}{\MHz}. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effects of grain temperature distribution on organic protostellar envelope chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Dust grains in circumstellar envelopes are likely to have a spread-out temperature distribution. Aims. To investigate how trends in temperature distribution between small and large grains affect the hot corino chemistry of complex organic molecules (COMs) and warm carbon-chain chemistry (WCCC). Methods. A multi-grain multi-layer astrochemical code with an up-to-date treatment of surface chemistry was used with three grain temperature trends: grain temperature proportional to grain radius to the power -1/6 (Model M-1/6), to 0 (M0), and to 1/6 (M1/6). The cases of hot corino and WCCC chemistry were investigated, for a total of six models. The essence of these changes is for the main ice reservoir - small grains - having higher (M-1/6) or lower (M1/6) temperature than the surrounding gas. Results. The chemistry of COMs shows better agreement with observations in models M-1/6 and M1/6 than in Model M0. Model M-1/6 shows best agreement for WCCC because earlier mass-evaporation of methane ice from small grains induces the WCCC phenomenon at lower temperatures. Conclusions. Models considering several grain populations with different temperatures can more precisely reproduce circumstellar chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent spin density functional theory (TD-SDFT) allows the theoretical description of spin and magnetization dynamics in electronic systems from first quantum mechanical principles. TD-SDFT accounts for electronic interaction effects via exchange-correlation scalar potentials and magnetic fields, which have to be suitably approximated in practice. We consider here an approach that was recently proposed for the ground state by Sharma et al. [J. Chem. Theor. Comput. 14, 1247 (2018)], which enforces the so-called "source-free" condition by eliminating monopole contributions contained within a given approximate exchange-correlation magnetic field. This procedure was shown to give good results for the structure of magnetic materials. We analyze the source-free construction in the linear-response regime, considering spin waves in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic electron gases. We observe a violation of Larmor's theorem in the paramagnetic case and a wrong long-wavelength behavior of ferromagnetic magnons. The practical implications of these violations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of the prototypical model for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids: the restricted primitive model. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are fundamental quantum many-body states of matter beyond Landau's paradigm. Here, we introduce the concept of quantum restored SPTs (QRSPTs), where the protecting symmetry is spontaneously broken at each instance in time, but restored after time average over quantum fluctuations, so that topological features re-emerge. To illustrate the concept, we study a one-dimensional fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with fluctuating superconducting order. We solve this problem in several limiting cases using a variety of analytical methods and compare them to numerical (density matrix renormalization group) simulations which are valid throughout the parameter regime. We thereby map out the phase diagram and identify a QRSPT phase with topological features which are reminiscent from (but not identical to) the topology of the underlying free fermion system. The QRSPT paradigm thereby stimulates a new perspective for the constructive design of novel topological quantum many-body phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe2 [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions in an antiferromagnet can travel as solitary waves in stark contrast to the situation in ferromagnets. Traveling skyrmion solutions have been found numerically in chiral antiferromagnets. We study head-on collision events between two skyrmions. We find that the result of the collision depends on the initial velocity of the skyrmions. For small velocities, the skyrmions shrink as they approach, then bounce back and eventually acquire almost their initial speed. For larger velocities, the skyrmions approach each other and shrink until they become singular points at some finite separation and are eventually annihilated. Considering skyrmion energetics, we can determine the regimes of the different dynamical behaviors. Using a collective co-ordinate approach, we reproduce the dynamics of the collisions including the variation of the size of the skyrmions and collapse above a critical velocity.</description>

      <title>Exciton lasing in carbon nanotubes below the population inversion threshold via phonon-mediated stimulated emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic optical transitions in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied for at least two decades. However, exploiting these transitions to produce a lasing effect has been proved unpractical due to the difficulties of achieving an excitonic population inversion in carbon nanotubes. In this work we show that lasing is theoretically possible at a much lower exciton population threshold by taking advantage of phonon stimulated emission. Specifically, the so-called Anti-Stokes transitions, where light is generated by the creation of a phonon and the annihilation of an exciton, can be used to sustain the coherent emission of photons. These transitions have been overlooked for long due to their low intensity as a consequence of the low occupancy of the associated phonon branches. We show that the best conditions to achieve the lasing effect are met in CNTs with i) excitons of non-zero momentum, ii) a strong exciton-phonon coupling and iii) narrow exciton transitions.</description>

      <title>Identifying trivial and Majorana zero-energy modes using the Majorana polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider superconductor-semiconductor hybrids containing both trivial and Majorana zero modes and explore their signatures in the Majorana polarization. In particular, we consider trivial zero energy states due to confinement and disorder, which seem to be very likely experimental scenarios. We show that the Majorana polarization is able to characterize the topological phase transition as well as the emergence of Majorana zero modes even when trivial zero-energy states proliferate. Notably, the Majorana polarization inherits direct information about spatial correlations which are then the key for distinguishing Majorana and trivial zero-modes. We demonstrate the utility of the Majorana polarization in normal-superconductor junctions and superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junctions. Our results support the interpretation of the Majorana polarization as a real space topological indicator.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted Auger decay of excitons in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes determines the optical quantum yield and plays a crucial role in the potential optoelectronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC). Here, we show that, in the presence of free carriers, an additional nonradiative decay channel opens for excitons in TMDC monolayers. Although the usual Auger decay channel is suppressed at low doping levels by the simultaneous momentum and energy conservation laws, exciton-phonon coupling relaxes this suppression. By solving a Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we calculate the phonon-assisted Auger decay rates in four typical TMDCs as a function of doping, temperature, and dielectric environment. We find that even for a relatively low doping of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the nonradiative lifetime ranges from 16 ps to 165 ps in different TMDCs, offering competition to the radiative decay channel.</description>

      <title>Correlated states in super-moire materials with a kernel polynomial quantics tensor cross algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-moire materials represent a novel playground to engineer states of matter beyond the possibilities of conventional moire materials. However, from the computational point of view, understanding correlated matter in these systems requires solving models with several millions of atoms, a formidable task for state-of-the-art methods. Conventional wavefunction methods for correlated matter scale with a cubic power with the number of sites, a major challenge for super-moire materials. Here, we introduce a methodology capable of solving correlated states in super-moire materials by combining a kernel polynomial method with a quantics tensor cross matrix product state algorithm. This strategy leverages a mapping of the super-moire structure to a many-body Hilbert space efficiently sampled with a tensor cross matrix product state method, where individual evaluations are performed with a Chebyshev kernel polynomial algorithm. We demonstrate this approach with interacting super-moire systems with up to several millions of atoms, showing its ability to capture correlated states in moire-of-moire systems and domain walls between different moire systems. Our manuscript puts forward a widely applicable methodology to study correlated matter in ultra-long length scales, enabling rationalizing correlated super-moire phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the experimental evidence of the Nagaoka ferromagnetism in quantum dot systems by Dehollain et al [1], we search for possible confirmation of such kind of ferromagnetism by analyzing the spin-resolved transport properties of a quadruple quantum dot system focusing on the linear response regime. In particular, we consider four quantum dots arranged in a two-by-two square lattice, coupled to external ferromagnetic source and drain electrodes. Turning on and off the specific conditions for the Nagaoka ferromagnetism to occur by changing the value of the intra-dot Coulomb interactions, we determine the transport coefficients, including the linear conductance, tunnel magnetoresistance and current spin polarization. We show that a sign change of the current spin polarization may be an indication of a ferromagnetic order of Nagaoka type which develops in the system.</description>

      <title>Increased formation of trions and charged biexcitons by above-gap excitation in single-layer $WSe_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors exhibit pronounced many-body effects and intense optical responses due to strong coulombic interactions. Consequently, subtle differences in photoexcitation conditions can strongly influence how the material dissipates energy during thermalization. Here, using multiple excitation spectroscopies, we show that a distinct thermalization pathway emerges at elevated excitation energies, enhancing the formation of trions and charged biexcitons in single-layer WSe2 by up to 2x and 5x, respectively. Power- and temperature-dependent measurements lend insight into the origin of the enhancement. These observations underscore the complexity of excited state relaxation in monolayer semiconductors, provide insight for the continued development of carrier thermalization models, and highlight the potential to precisely control excitonic yields and probe non-equilibrium dynamics in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Fractalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Adopting quadratic fermionic models on Sierpinski carpet, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic correction for area law in the scaling of entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, different from the fractal structure of the lattice, we observe the emergence of a novel self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Meanwhile, as the direct consequence of the entanglement fractal and beyond a single scaling behavior of entanglement contour in translation-invariant systems, we identify two distinct scaling behaviors in the entanglement contour of fractal systems. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

Abstract: With recent experimental advancements demonstrating high-fidelity universal logic gates and basic programmability, Silicon-based spin quantum bit (qubit) have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. However, implementation of more complex quantum information protocols with many qubits still remains a critical challenge for realization of practical programmability in Silicon devices. In this study, we present a computational investigation of entanglement-based quantum information applications implemented on an electrically defined quantum dot structure in Silicon. Using in-house multi-scale simulations based on tight-binding calculations augmented with bulk physics, we model a five quantum dot system that can create up to five electron spin qubits, and discuss details of control engineering needed to implement single-qubit rotations and two-qubit logic operations in a programmable manner. Using these elementary operations, then, we design a five-qubit quantum teleportation protocol and computationally verify its end-to-end operation including a simple but clear analysis on how the designed circuit can be affected by charge noise. With engineering details that are not well uncovered by experiments, our results demonstrate the advanced programmability of Silicon quantum dot systems, delivering the practical guidelines for potential designs of quantum information processes based on electrically defined Silicon quantum dot structures.</description>

Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

      <title>Enhanced room temperature ferromagnetism in nanostructured MoS2 flakes by hydrogen post-treatment: Combined experimental and first-principles-based studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We meticulously study the individual effects of hydrogen irradiation and annealing on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of nanostructured MoS2 thin films grown through Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). The role of edge-terminated structure and point defects to induce room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is thoroughly investigated. The nanostructured pristine MoS2 thin films show the formation of a pure 2-H MoS2 phase, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Pristine MoS2 thin films are independently annealed in a reducing hydrogen environment and irradiated with low-energy hydrogen ions to study the significance of point defects like sulfur vacancies. RTFM with saturation magnetization value (Ms: 1.66 emu/g) has been observed in the pristine film. Magnetization increases after irradiation and annealing processes. However, hydrogen annealing at a temperature of 200oC exhibits a maximum Ms value of 2.7 emu/g at room temperature. The increase in ferromagnetism is attributed to an increment in sulfur vacancies, hydrogen adsorption with sulfur, and modification in edges, which is confirmed by the analysis of Electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that the edge-oriented structure of MoS2 exhibits a magnetization value of 3.2 {\mu}B. Additionally, introducing an S-vacancy and H-adsorption in a parallel position to the sulfur further enhances the magnetization value to 3.85 {\mu}B and 3.43 {\mu}B respectively. These findings align broadly with our experimental results.</description>
