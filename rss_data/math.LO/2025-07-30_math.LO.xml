      <title>A combinatorial characterization of Kim's lemma for pairs of bi-invariant types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial consistency-inconsistency configuration that is equivalent to the failure of the following form of Kim's lemma for a given $k$: $(\star)$ For any set of parameters $A$, formula $\varphi(x,b)$, and $A$-bi-invariant types $p$ and $q$ extending $\mathrm{tp}(b/A)$, if $\varphi(x,b)$ $k$-divides along $p$, then it divides along $q$.
  We then give an equivalent technical variant of $(\star)$ that is non-trivial over arbitrary invariance bases. We also show that the failure of weaker versions of $(\star)$ entails the existence of stronger combinatorial configurations, the strongest of which can be phrased in terms of families of parameters indexed by arbitrary cographs (i.e., $P_4$-free graphs).
  Finally, we show that if there is an array $(b_{i,j} : i,j &lt; \omega)$ of parameters such that $\{\varphi(x,b_{i,j}) : (i,j) \in C\}$ is consistent whenever $C \subseteq \omega^2$ is a chain (in the product partial order) and $k$-inconsistent whenever $C$ is an antichain, then there is a model $M$, parameter $b$, and $M$-coheirs $p,q \supset \mathrm{tp}(b/M)$ such that $q^{\otimes \omega}$ is an $M$-heir-coheir and $\varphi(x,b)$ $k$-divides along $p$ but does not divide along $q$. In doing so, we also show that this configuration entails the failure of generic stationary local character under the assumption of $\mathsf{GCH}$.</description>

      <title>First-order aspects of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results on the model theory of Artin groups, focusing on Artin groups which are ``far from right-angled Artin groups''. The first result is that if $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of Artin groups whose irreducible components are acylindrically hyperbolic and torsion-free, then the model theory of Artin groups of type $\mathcal{C}$ reduces to the model theory of its irreducible components. The second result is that the problem of superstability of a given non-abelian Artin group $A$ reduces to certain dihedral parabolic subgroups of $A$ being $n$-pure in $A$, for certain large enough primes $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The third result is that two spherical Artin groups are elementary equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic. Finally, we prove that the affine Artin groups of type $\tilde{A}_n$, for $n \geq 4$, can be distinguished from the other simply laced affine Artin groups using existential sentences; this uses homology results of independent interest relying on the recent proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Maximal order types for sequences with gap condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higman's lemma states that for any well partial order $X$, the partial order $X^*$ of finite sequences with members from $X$ is also well. By combining results due to Girard as well as Sch\"{u}tte and Simpson, one can show that Higman's lemma is equivalent to arithmetical comprehension over $\textsf{RCA}_0$, the usual base system of reverse mathematics. By incorporating Friedman's gap condition, Sch\"{u}tte and Simpson defined a slightly different order on finite number sequences with fewer comparisons. While it is still true that their definition yields a well partial order, it turns out that arithmetical comprehension is not enough to prove this fact. Gordeev considered a symmetric variation of this gap condition for sequences with members from arbitrary well orders. He could show, over $\textsf{RCA}_0$, that his partial order on sequences is well (for any underlying well order) if and only if arithmetical transfinite recursion is available. We present a new and simpler proof of this fact and extend Gordeev's results to weak and strong gap conditions as well as binary trees with weakly ascending labels. Moreover, we compute the maximal order types of all considered structures.</description>

      <title>Model theory of Hilbert spaces expanded by normal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expansions of Hilbert spaces with a bounded normal operator $T$. We axiomatize this theory in a natural language and identify all of its completions. We prove the definability of the adjoint $T^*$ and prove quantifier elimination for every completion after adding $T^*$ to the language. We identify types with measures on the spectrum of the operator and show that the logic topology on the type space corresponds to the weak*-topology on the space of measures. We also give a precise formula for the metric on the space of $1$-types. We prove all completions are stable and characterize the stability spectrum of the theory in terms of the spectrum of the operator. We also show all completions, regardless of their spectrum, are $\omega$-stable up to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Bi-invariant types, reliably invariant types, and the comb tree property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and examine some special classes of invariant types$\unicode{x2014}$bi-invariant, strongly bi-invariant, extendibly invariant, and reliably invariant types$\unicode{x2014}$and show that they are related to certain model-theoretic tree properties.
  We show that the comb tree property (recently introduced by Mutchnik) is equivalent to the failure of Kim's lemma for bi-invariant types and is implied by the failure of Kim's lemma for reliably invariant types over invariance bases. We show that every type over an invariance base extends to a reliably invariant type$\unicode{x2014}$generalizing an unpublished result of Kruckman and Ramsey$\unicode{x2014}$and use this to show that, under a reasonable definition of Kim-dividing, Kim-forking coincides with Kim-dividing over invariance bases in theories without the comb tree property. Assuming a measurable cardinal, we characterize the comb tree property in terms of a form of dual local character.
  We also show that the antichain tree property (introduced by Ahn and Kim) seems to have a somewhat similar relationship to strong bi-invariance. In particular, we show that NATP theories satisfy Kim's lemma for strongly bi-invariant types and (assuming a measurable cardinal) satisfy a different form of dual local character. Furthermore, we examine a mutual generalization of the local character properties satisfied by NTP$_2$ and NSOP$_1$ theories and show that it is satisfied by all NATP theories.
  Finally, we give some related minor results$\unicode{x2014}$a strengthened local character characterization of NSOP$_1$ and a characterization of coheirs in terms of invariant extensions in expansions$\unicode{x2014}$as well as a pathological example of Kim-dividing.</description>

      <title>Preconditionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work, we introduced a new semantics for conditionals, covering a large class of what we call preconditionals. In this paper, we undertake an axiomatic study of preconditionals and subclasses of preconditionals. We then prove that any bounded lattice equipped with a preconditional can be represented by a relational structure, suitably topologized, yielding a single relational semantics for conditional logics normally treated by different semantics, as well as generalizing beyond those semantics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a model-theoretic characterisation of the geometric theories classified by \'etendues -- the `locally localic' topoi. They are the theories where each model is determined, syntactically and semantically, by any witness of a fixed collection of formulae.</description>

      <title>The interdefinability of expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.</description>
