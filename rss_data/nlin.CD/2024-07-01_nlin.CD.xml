      <title>Shearless effective barriers to chaotic transport induced by even twin islands in nontwist systems</title>

Abstract: For several decades now it has been known that systems with shearless invariant tori, nontwist Hamiltonian systems, possess barriers to chaotic transport. These barriers are resilient to breakage under perturbation and therefore regions where they occur are natural places to look for barriers to transport. We describe a novel kind of effective barrier that persists after the shearless torus is broken. Because phenomena are generic, for convenience we study the Standard Nontwist Map (SNM), an area-preserving map that violates the twist condition locally in the phase space. The novel barrier occurs in nontwist systems when twin even period islands are present, which happens for a broad range of parameter values in the SNM. With a phase space composed of regular and irregular orbits, the movement of chaotic trajectories is hampered by the existence of both shearless curves, total barriers, and a network of partial barriers formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic points. Being a degenerate system, the SNM has twin islands and, consequently, twin hyperbolic points. We show that the structures formed by the manifolds intrinsically depend on period parity of the twin islands. For this even scenario the novel structure, named a torus free barrier, occurs because the manifolds of different hyperbolic points form an intricate chain atop a dipole configuration and the transport of chaotic trajectories through the chain becomes a rare event. This structure impacts the emergence of transport, the escape basin for chaotic trajectories, the transport mechanism and the chaotic saddle. The case of odd periodic orbits is different: we find for this case the emergence of transport immediately after the breakup of the last invariant curve, and this leads to a scenario of higher transport, with intricate escape basin boundary and a chaotic saddle with non-uniformly distributed points.</description>
