      <title>Invading activity fronts stabilize excitable systems against stochastic extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic chemical reaction or population dynamics in finite systems often terminates in an absorbing state. Yet in large spatially extended systems, the time to reach species extinction (or fixation) becomes exceedingly long. Tuning control parameters may diminish the survival probability, rendering species coexistence susceptible to stochastic extinction events. In inhomogeneous settings, where a vulnerable subsystem is diffusively coupled to an adjacent stable patch, the former is reanimated through continuous influx from the interfaces, provided the absorbing region sustains spreading activity fronts. We demonstrate this generic elimination of finite-size extinction instabilities via immigration flux in predator-prey, epidemic spreading, and cyclic competition models.</description>

      <title>Animal social networks as intersections graphs of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study here the social network generated by the asynchronous visits, to a fixed set of sites, of mobile agents modelled as independent random walks on the plane lattice. The social network is constructed by assuming that a group of agents are associated if they have visited the same set of sites within a finite time interval. This construction is an instance of a random intersection graph, and has been used in the literature to study association networks in a number of animal species. We characterize the mathematical structure of these networks, which we view as one-mode projections of suitable bipartite graphs or, equivalently, as 2-sections of the corresponding hypergraphs. We determine analytically the probability distribution of the random bipartite graphs and hypergraphs associated to this construction, and suggest that association networks generated by the use of common resources are better described by hypergraphs rather than simple projected graphs, that miss important information regarding the actual associations among the agents.</description>

      <title>Characterizing semi-directed phylogenetic networks and their multi-rootable variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a flexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve reticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to focus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These graphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of the arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph whose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source or root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit in nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not. In this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of semi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is, mixed graphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have more than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the theory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry picking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a (multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted network that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child, orchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural aspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved theoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within the development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such networks.</description>

      <title>Viral population dynamics at the cellular level, considering the replication cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that require a host cell for replication. Viral replication occurs in several stages, and the completion time for each stage varies due to differences in the cellular environment. Thus, the time to complete each stage in viral replication is a random variable. However, no analytic expression exists for the viral population at the cellular level when the completion time for each process constituting viral replication is a random variable. This paper presents a simplified model of viral replication, treating each stage as a renewal process with independently and identically distributed completion times. Using the proposed model, we derive an analytical formula for viral populations at the cellular level, based on viewing viral replication as a birth-death process. The mean viral count is expressed via probability density functions representing the completion time for each step in the replication process. This work validates the results with stochastic simulations. This study provides a new quantitative framework for understanding viral infection dynamics.</description>
