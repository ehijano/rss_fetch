      <title>Topological conditions drive stability in meta-ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a global level, ecological communities are being perturbed at an unprecedented rate by human activities and environmental instabilities. Yet, we understand little about what factors facilitate or impede long-term persistence of these communities. While observational studies indicate that increased biodiversity must, somehow, be driving stability, theoretical studies have argued the exact opposite viewpoint instead. This encouraged many researchers to participate in the ongoing diversity-stability debate. Within this context, however, there has been a severe lack of studies that consider spatial features explicitly, even though nearly all habitats are spatially embedded. To this end, we study here the linear stability of meta-ecosystems on networks that describe how discrete patches are connected by dispersal between them. By combining results from random matrix theory and network theory, we are able to show that there are three distinct features that underlie stability: edge density, tendency to triadic closure, and isolation or fragmentation. Our results appear to further indicate that network sparsity does not necessarily reduce stability, and that connections between patches are just as, if not more, important to consider when studying the stability of large ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Security and Utility in Next-Generation Epidemic Risk Mitigation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.08069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemics like the recent COVID-19 require proactive contact tracing and epidemiological analysis to predict and subsequently contain infection transmissions. The proactive measures require large scale data collection, which simultaneously raise concerns regarding users' privacy. Digital contact tracing systems developed in response to COVID-19 either collected extensive data for effective analytics at the cost of users' privacy or collected minimal data for the sake of user privacy but were ineffective in predicting and mitigating the epidemic risks. We present Silmarillion--in preparation for future epidemics--a system that reconciles user's privacy with rich data collection for higher utility. In Silmarillion, user devices record Bluetooth encounters with beacons installed in strategic locations. The beacons further enrich the encounters with geo-location, location type, and environment conditions at the beacon installation site. This enriched information enables detailed scientific analysis of disease parameters as well as more accurate personalized exposure risk notification. At the same time, Silmarillion provides privacy to all participants and non-participants at the same level as that guaranteed in digital and manual contact tracing. We describe the design of Silmarillion and its communication protocols that ensure user privacy and data security. We also evaluate a prototype of Silmarillion built using low-end IoT boards, showing that the power consumption and user latencies are adequately low for a practical deployment. Finally, we briefly report on a small-scale deployment within a university building as a proof-of-concept.</description>

      <title>Critical mobility in policy making for epidemic containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When considering airborne epidemic spreading in social systems, a natural connection arises between mobility and epidemic contacts. As individuals travel, possibilities to encounter new people either at the final destination or during the transportation process appear. Such contacts can lead to new contagion events. In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves. We consider how the different interventions impact societal well-being, the economy and the population. Finally, we propose a mitigation framework based on the critical nature of mobility in an epidemic, able to suppress incidence and oscillations at will, preventing extreme incidence peaks with potential to saturate health care resources.</description>
