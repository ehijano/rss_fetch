      <title>AID-DTI: Accelerating High-fidelity Diffusion Tensor Imaging with Detail-preserving Model-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown great potential in accelerating diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Nevertheless, existing methods tend to suffer from Rician noise and eddy current, leading to detail loss in reconstructing the DTI-derived parametric maps especially when sparsely sampled q-space data are used. To address this, this paper proposes a novel method, AID-DTI (\textbf{A}ccelerating h\textbf{I}gh fi\textbf{D}elity \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{T}ensor \textbf{I}maging), to facilitate fast and accurate DTI with only six measurements. AID-DTI is equipped with a newly designed Singular Value Decomposition-based regularizer, which can effectively capture fine details while suppressing noise during network training by exploiting the correlation across DTI-derived parameters. Additionally, we introduce a Nesterov-based adaptive learning algorithm that optimizes the regularization parameter dynamically to enhance the performance. AID-DTI is an extendable framework capable of incorporating flexible network architecture. Experimental results on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data consistently demonstrate that the proposed method estimates DTI parameter maps with fine-grained details and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>SDE-based Multiplicative Noise Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicative noise, also known as speckle or pepper noise, commonly affects images produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR), lasers, or optical lenses. Unlike additive noise, which typically arises from thermal processes or external factors, multiplicative noise is inherent to the system, originating from the fluctuation in diffuse reflections. These fluctuations result in multiple copies of the same signal with varying magnitudes being combined. Consequently, despeckling, or removing multiplicative noise, necessitates different techniques compared to those used for additive noise removal.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Stochastic Differential Equations based diffusion models to address multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that multiplicative noise can be effectively modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process in the logarithmic domain. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive the corresponding reverse process for image denoising. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two different datasets, comparing our approach to both classical signal processing techniques and contemporary CNN-based noise removal models. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on perception-based metrics such as FID and LPIPS, while maintaining competitive performance on traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.</description>

      <title>Cervical Cancer Detection Using Multi-Branch Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cervical cancer is a crucial global health concern for women, and the persistent infection of High-risk HPV mainly triggers this remains a global health challenge, with young women diagnosis rates soaring from 10\% to 40\% over three decades. While Pap smear screening is a prevalent diagnostic method, visual image analysis can be lengthy and often leads to mistakes. Early detection of the disease can contribute significantly to improving patient outcomes. In recent decades, many researchers have employed machine learning techniques that achieved promise in cervical cancer detection processes based on medical images. In recent years, many researchers have employed various deep-learning techniques to achieve high-performance accuracy in detecting cervical cancer but are still facing various challenges. This research proposes an innovative and novel approach to automate cervical cancer image classification using Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method leverages the strengths of both MHSA mechanisms and CNN to effectively capture both local and global features within cervical images in two streams. MHSA facilitates the model's ability to focus on relevant regions of interest, while CNN extracts hierarchical features that contribute to accurate classification. Finally, we combined the two stream features and fed them into the classification module to refine the feature and the classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we used the SIPaKMeD dataset, which classifies cervical cells into five categories. Our model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.522\%. This performance has high recognition accuracy of medical image classification and holds promise for its applicability in other medical image recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Explainable Image Classification for Dementia Stages Using Convolutional Neural Network and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial of an explainable approach using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to classify four progressive dementia stages based on open MRI brain images. The detailed implementation steps are demonstrated with an explanation. Whilst the proposed CNN architecture is demonstrated to achieve more than 99% accuracy for the test dataset, the computational procedure of CNN remains a black box. The visualisation based on Grad-CAM is attempted to explain such very high accuracy and may provide useful information for physicians. Future motivation based on this work is discussed.</description>

      <title>Generating Multi-frame Ultrawide-field Fluorescein Angiography from Ultrawide-field Color Imaging Improves Diabetic Retinopathy Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrawide-field fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) facilitates diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection by providing a clear visualization of peripheral retinal lesions. However, the intravenous dye injection with potential risks hamper its application. We aim to acquire dye-free UWF-FA images from noninvasive UWF color fundus (UWF-CF) images using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and evaluate its effectiveness in DR screening. A total of 18,321 UWF-FA images of different phases were registered with corresponding UWF-CF images and fed into a generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based model for training. The quality of generated UWF-FA images was evaluated through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. The DeepDRiD dataset was used to externally assess the contribution of generated UWF-FA images to DR classification, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as outcome metrics. The generated early, mid, and late phase UWF-FA images achieved high authenticity, with multi-scale similarity scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and qualitative visual scores ranging from 1.64 to 1.98 (1=real UWF-FA quality). In fifty randomly selected images, 56% to 76% of the generated images were difficult to distinguish from real images in the Turing test. Moreover, adding these generated UWF-FA images for DR classification significantly increased the AUROC from 0.869 to 0.904 compared to the baseline model using UWF-CF images (P &lt; .001). The model successfully generates realistic multi-frame UWF-FA images without intravenous dye injection. The generated UWF-FA enhanced DR stratification.</description>

      <title>deepmriprep: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) Preprocessing via Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) has emerged as a powerful approach in neuroimaging research, utilized in over 7,000 studies since the year 2000. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, VBM assesses variations in the local density of brain tissue and examines its associations with biological and psychometric variables. Here, we present deepmriprep, a neural network-based pipeline that performs all necessary preprocessing steps for VBM analysis of T1-weighted MR images using deep neural networks. Utilizing the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), deepmriprep is 37 times faster than CAT12, the leading VBM preprocessing toolbox. The proposed method matches CAT12 in accuracy for tissue segmentation and image registration across more than 100 datasets and shows strong correlations in VBM results. Tissue segmentation maps from deepmriprep have over 95% agreement with ground truth maps, and its non-linear registration, using supervised SYMNet, predicts smooth deformation fields comparable to CAT12. The high processing speed of deepmriprep enables rapid preprocessing of extensive datasets and thereby fosters the application of VBM analysis to large-scale neuroimaging studies and opens the door to real-time applications. Finally, deepmripreps straightforward, modular design enables researchers to easily understand, reuse, and advance the underlying methods, fostering further advancements in neuroimaging research. deepmriprep can be conveniently installed as a Python package and is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep.</description>

      <title>End-to-end learned Lossy Dynamic Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in point cloud compression have primarily emphasized geometry compression while comparatively fewer efforts have been dedicated to attribute compression. This study introduces an end-to-end learned dynamic lossy attribute coding approach, utilizing an efficient high-dimensional convolution to capture extensive inter-point dependencies. This enables the efficient projection of attribute features into latent variables. Subsequently, we employ a context model that leverage previous latent space in conjunction with an auto-regressive context model for encoding the latent tensor into a bitstream. Evaluation of our method on widely utilized point cloud datasets from the MPEG and Microsoft demonstrates its superior performance compared to the core attribute compression module Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform method from MPEG Geometry Point Cloud Compression with 38.1% Bjontegaard Delta-rate saving in average while ensuring a low-complexity encoding/decoding.</description>

      <title>Classification of Endoscopy and Video Capsule Images using CNN-Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gastrointestinal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related incidence and death, making it crucial to develop novel computer-aided diagnosis systems for early detection and enhanced treatment. Traditional approaches rely on the expertise of gastroenterologists to identify diseases; however, this process is subjective, and interpretation can vary even among expert clinicians. Considering recent advancements in classifying gastrointestinal anomalies and landmarks in endoscopic and video capsule endoscopy images, this study proposes a hybrid model that combines the advantages of Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance classification performance. Our model utilizes DenseNet201 as a CNN branch to extract local features and integrates a Swin Transformer branch for global feature understanding, combining both to perform the classification task. For the GastroVision dataset, our proposed model demonstrates excellent performance with Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.8320, 0.8386, 0.8324, 0.8386, and 0.8191, respectively, showcasing its robustness against class imbalance and surpassing other CNNs as well as the Swin Transformer model. Similarly, for the Kvasir-Capsule, a large video capsule endoscopy dataset, our model outperforms all others, achieving overall Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, and MCC of 0.7007, 0.7239, 0.6900, 0.7239, and 0.3871. Moreover, we generated saliency maps to explain our model's focus areas, demonstrating its reliable decision-making process. The results underscore the potential of our hybrid CNN-Transformer model in aiding the early and accurate detection of gastrointestinal (GI) anomalies.</description>

      <title>CO2Wounds-V2: Extended Chronic Wounds Dataset From Leprosy Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wounds pose an ongoing health concern globally, largely due to the prevalence of conditions such as diabetes and leprosy's disease. The standard method of monitoring these wounds involves visual inspection by healthcare professionals, a practice that could present challenges for patients in remote areas with inadequate transportation and healthcare infrastructure. This has led to the development of algorithms designed for the analysis and follow-up of wound images, which perform image-processing tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms heavily depends on the availability of comprehensive and varied wound image data, which is usually scarce. This paper introduces the CO2Wounds-V2 dataset, an extended collection of RGB wound images from leprosy patients with their corresponding semantic segmentation annotations, aiming to enhance the development and testing of image-processing algorithms in the medical field.</description>

      <title>ISLES'24: Improving final infarct prediction in ischemic stroke using multimodal imaging and clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of core (irreversibly damaged tissue) and penumbra (salvageable tissue) volumes is essential for ischemic stroke treatment decisions. Perfusion CT, the clinical standard, estimates these volumes but is affected by variations in deconvolution algorithms, implementations, and thresholds. Core tissue expands over time, with growth rates influenced by thrombus location, collateral circulation, and inherent patient-specific factors. Understanding this tissue growth is crucial for determining the need to transfer patients to comprehensive stroke centers, predicting the benefits of additional reperfusion attempts during mechanical thrombectomy, and forecasting final clinical outcomes. This work presents the ISLES'24 challenge, which addresses final post-treatment stroke infarct prediction from pre-interventional acute stroke imaging and clinical data. ISLES'24 establishes a unique 360-degree setting where all feasibly accessible clinical data are available for participants, including full CT acute stroke imaging, sub-acute follow-up MRI, and clinical tabular data. The contributions of this work are two-fold: first, we introduce a standardized benchmarking of final stroke infarct segmentation algorithms through the ISLES'24 challenge; second, we provide insights into infarct segmentation using multimodal imaging and clinical data strategies by identifying outperforming methods on a finely curated dataset. The outputs of this challenge are anticipated to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcome predictions. All ISLES'24 materials, including data, performance evaluation scripts, and leading algorithmic strategies, are available to the research community following \url{https://isles-24.grand-challenge.org/}.</description>

      <title>Denoising Plane Wave Ultrasound Images Using Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound plane wave imaging is a cutting-edge technique that enables high frame-rate imaging. However, one challenge associated with high frame-rate ultrasound imaging is the high noise associated with them, hindering their wider adoption. Therefore, the development of a denoising method becomes imperative to augment the quality of plane wave images. Drawing inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), our proposed solution aims to enhance plane wave image quality. Specifically, the method considers the distinction between low-angle and high-angle compounding plane waves as noise and effectively eliminates it by adapting a DDPM to beamformed radiofrequency (RF) data. The method underwent training using only 400 simulated images. In addition, our approach employs natural image segmentation masks as intensity maps for the generated images, resulting in accurate denoising for various anatomy shapes. The proposed method was assessed across simulation, phantom, and in vivo images. The results of the evaluations indicate that our approach not only enhances image quality on simulated data but also demonstrates effectiveness on phantom and in vivo data in terms of image quality. Comparative analysis with other methods underscores the superiority of our proposed method across various evaluation metrics. The source code and trained model will be released along with the dataset at: http://code.sonography.ai</description>

      <title>FPCA: Field-Programmable Pixel Convolutional Array for Extreme-Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural network applications necessitates hardware that not only accelerates computation but also adapts efficiently to dynamic processing requirements. While processing-in-pixel has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the bottlenecks of traditional architectures at the extreme-edge, existing implementations face limitations in reconfigurability and scalability due to their static nature and inefficient area usage. Addressing these challenges, we present a novel architecture that significantly enhances the capabilities of processing-in-pixel for convolutional neural networks. Our design innovatively integrates non-volatile memory (NVM) with novel unit pixel circuit design, enabling dynamic reconfiguration of synaptic weights, kernel size, channel size and stride size. Thus offering unprecedented flexibility and adaptability. With using a separate die for pixel circuit and storing synaptic weights, our circuit achieves a substantial reduction in the required area per pixel thereby increasing the density and scalability of the pixel array. Simulation results demonstrate dot product operations of the circuit, the non-linearity of its analog output and a novel bucket-select curvefit model is proposed to capture it. This work not only addresses the limitations of current in-pixel computing approaches but also opens new avenues for developing more efficient, flexible, and scalable neural network hardware, paving the way for advanced AI applications.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Beam Profiles from Silicon Photonics Gratings using Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</description>

      <title>Parallel Processing of Point Cloud Ground Segmentation for Mechanical and Solid-State LiDARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel parallel processing framework for real-time point cloud ground segmentation on FPGA platforms, aimed at adapting LiDAR algorithms to the evolving landscape from mechanical to solid-state LiDAR (SSL) technologies. Focusing on the ground segmentation task, we explore parallel processing techniques on existing approaches and adapt them to real-world SSL data handling. We validated frame-segmentation based parallel processing methods using point-based, voxel-based, and range-image-based ground segmentation approaches on the SemanticKITTI dataset based on mechanical LiDAR. The results revealed the superior performance and robustness of the range-image method, especially in its resilience to slicing. Further, utilizing a custom dataset from our self-built Camera-SSLSS equipment, we examined regular SSL data frames and validated the effectiveness of our parallel approach for SSL sensor. Additionally, our pioneering implementation of range-image ground segmentation on FPGA for SSL sensors demonstrated significant processing speed improvements and resource efficiency, achieving processing rates up to 50.3 times faster than conventional CPU setups. These findings underscore the potential of parallel processing strategies to significantly enhance LiDAR technologies for advanced perception tasks in autonomous systems. Post-publication, both the data and the code will be made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Diff-PCC: Diffusion-based Neural Compression for 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable diffusion networks have emerged as a groundbreaking development for their ability to produce realistic and detailed visual content. This characteristic renders them ideal decoders, capable of producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based point cloud compression method, dubbed Diff-PCC, to leverage the expressive power of the diffusion model for generative and aesthetically superior decoding. Different from the conventional autoencoder fashion, a dual-space latent representation is devised in this paper, in which a compressor composed of two independent encoding backbones is considered to extract expressive shape latents from distinct latent spaces. At the decoding side, a diffusion-based generator is devised to produce high-quality reconstructions by considering the shape latents as guidance to stochastically denoise the noisy point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed Diff-PCC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance (e.g., 7.711 dB BD-PSNR gains against the latest G-PCC standard at ultra-low bitrate) while attaining superior subjective quality. Source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Novel Change Detection Framework in Remote Sensing Imagery Using Diffusion Models and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Change detection is a crucial task in remote sensing, enabling the monitoring of environmental changes, urban growth, and disaster impact. Conventional change detection techniques, such as image differencing and ratioing, often struggle with noise and fail to capture complex variations in imagery. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly generative models like diffusion models, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the strengths of Stable Diffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to create robust and interpretable change maps. Our approach, named Diffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world remote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing techniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios with complex changes and noise.</description>

      <title>A Noncontact Technique for Wave Measurement Based on Thermal Stereography and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of the wave field and its spatiotemporal evolution is essential in many hydrodynamic experiments and engineering applications. The binocular stereo imaging technique has been widely used to measure waves. However, the optical properties of indoor water surfaces, including transparency, specular reflection, and texture absence, pose challenges for image processing and stereo reconstruction. This study proposed a novel technique that combined thermal stereography and deep learning to achieve fully noncontact wave measurements. The optical imaging properties of water in the long-wave infrared spectrum were found to be suitable for stereo matching, effectively avoiding the issues in the visible-light spectrum. After capturing wave images using thermal stereo cameras, a reconstruction strategy involving deep learning techniques was proposed to improve stereo matching performance. A generative approach was employed to synthesize a dataset with ground-truth disparity from unannotated infrared images. This dataset was then fed to a pretrained stereo neural network for fine-tuning to achieve domain adaptation. Wave flume experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed technique. The final reconstruction results indicated great agreement and high accuracy with a mean bias of less than 2.1% compared with the measurements obtained using wave probes, suggesting that the novel technique effectively measures the spatiotemporal distribution of wave surface in hydrodynamic experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine vision enhances automation, quality control, and operational efficiency in industrial applications by enabling machines to interpret and act on visual data. While traditional computer vision algorithms and approaches remain widely utilized, machine learning has become pivotal in current research activities. In particular, generative \gls*{AI} demonstrates promising potential by improving pattern recognition capabilities, through data augmentation, increasing image resolution, and identifying anomalies for quality control. However, the application of generative \gls*{AI} in machine vision is still in its early stages due to challenges in data diversity, computational requirements, and the necessity for robust validation methods. A comprehensive literature review is essential to understand the current state of generative \gls*{AI} in industrial machine vision, focusing on recent advancements, applications, and research trends. Thus, a literature review based on the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, analyzing over 1,200 papers on generative \gls*{AI} in industrial machine vision. Our findings reveal various patterns in current research, with the primary use of generative \gls*{AI} being data augmentation, for machine vision tasks such as classification and object detection. Furthermore, we gather a collection of application challenges together with data requirements to enable a successful application of generative \gls*{AI} in industrial machine vision. This overview aims to provide researchers with insights into the different areas and applications within current research, highlighting significant advancements and identifying opportunities for future work.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Compression? Impact of AI-based Codecs on Biometrics for Law Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based biometrics can aid law enforcement in various aspects, for example in iris, fingerprint and soft-biometric recognition. A critical precondition for recognition is the availability of sufficient biometric information in images. It is visually apparent that strong JPEG compression removes such details. However, latest AI-based image compression seemingly preserves many image details even for very strong compression factors. Yet, these perceived details are not necessarily grounded in measurements, which raises the question whether these images can still be used for biometric recognition. In this work, we investigate how AI compression impacts iris, fingerprint and soft-biometric (fabrics and tattoo) images. We also investigate the recognition performance for iris and fingerprint images after AI compression. It turns out that iris recognition can be strongly affected, while fingerprint recognition is quite robust. The loss of detail is qualitatively best seen in fabrics and tattoos images. Overall, our results show that AI-compression still permits many biometric tasks, but attention to strong compression factors in sensitive tasks is advisable.</description>

      <title>Influence of Medical Foreign Bodies on Dark-Field Chest Radiographs: First experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Evaluating the effects and artifacts introduced by medical foreign bodies in clinical dark-field chest radiographs and assessing their influence on the evaluation of pulmonary tissue, compared to conventional radiographs.
  Material &amp; Methods: This retrospective study analyzed data from subjects enrolled in clinical trials conducted between 2018 and 2021, focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 patients. All patients obtained a radiograph using an in-house developed clinical prototype for grating-based dark-field chest radiography. The prototype simultaneously delivers a conventional and dark-field radiograph. Two radiologists independently assessed the clinical studies to identify patients with foreign bodies. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted on the effects and artifacts attributed to distinct foreign bodies and their impact on the assessment of pulmonary tissue.
  Results: Overall, 30 subjects with foreign bodies were included in this study (mean age, 64 years +/- 11 [standard deviation]; 15 men). Foreign bodies composed of materials lacking microstructure exhibited a diminished dark-field signal or no discernible signal. Foreign bodies with a microstructure, in our investigations the cementation of the kyphoplasty, produce a positive dark-field signal. Since most foreign bodies lack microstructural features, dark-field imaging revealed fewer signals and artifacts by foreign bodies compared to conventional radiographs.
  Conclusion: Dark-field radiography enhances the assessment of pulmonary tissue with overlaying foreign bodies compared to conventional radiography. Reduced interfering signals result in fewer overlapping radiopaque artifacts within the investigated regions. This mitigates the impact on image quality and interpretability of the radiographs and the projection-related limitations of radiography compared to CT.</description>

      <title>SDI-Net: Toward Sufficient Dual-View Interaction for Low-light Stereo Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, most low-light image enhancement methods only consider information from a single view, neglecting the correlation between cross-view information. Therefore, the enhancement results produced by these methods are often unsatisfactory. In this context, there have been efforts to develop methods specifically for low-light stereo image enhancement. These methods take into account the cross-view disparities and enable interaction between the left and right views, leading to improved performance. However, these methods still do not fully exploit the interaction between left and right view information. To address this issue, we propose a model called Toward Sufficient Dual-View Interaction for Low-light Stereo Image Enhancement (SDI-Net). The backbone structure of SDI-Net is two encoder-decoder pairs, which are used to learn the mapping function from low-light images to normal-light images. Among the encoders and the decoders, we design a module named Cross-View Sufficient Interaction Module (CSIM), aiming to fully exploit the correlations between the binocular views via the attention mechanism. The quantitative and visual results on public datasets validate the superiority of our method over other related methods. Ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have established new state of the art in a multitude of computer vision tasks, including image restoration. Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.</description>

      <title>SR+Codec: a Benchmark of Super-Resolution for Video Compression Bitrate Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in Super-Resolution (SR), which focuses on generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input. Deep learning-based methods for super-resolution have been particularly popular and have shown impressive results on various benchmarks. However, research indicates that these methods may not perform as well on strongly compressed videos. We developed a super-resolution benchmark to analyze SR's capacity to upscale compressed videos. Our dataset employed video codecs based on five widely-used compression standards: H.264, H.265, H.266, AV1, and AVS3. We assessed 19 popular SR models using our benchmark and evaluated their ability to restore details and their susceptibility to compression artifacts. To get an accurate perceptual ranking of SR models, we conducted a crowd-sourced side-by-side comparison of their outputs. We found that some SR models, combined with compression, allow us to reduce the video bitrate without significant loss of quality. We also compared a range of image and video quality metrics with subjective scores to evaluate their accuracy on super-resolved compressed videos. The benchmark is publicly available at https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/super-resolution-for-video-compression.html</description>

      <title>Atlas-Based Interpretable Age Prediction In Whole-Body MR Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07439v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age prediction is an important part of medical assessments and research. It can aid in detecting diseases as well as abnormal ageing by highlighting potential discrepancies between chronological and biological age. To improve understanding of age-related changes in various body parts, we investigate the ageing of the human body on a large scale by using whole-body 3D images. We utilise the Grad-CAM method to determine the body areas most predictive of a person's age. In order to expand our analysis beyond individual subjects, we employ registration techniques to generate population-wide importance maps that show the most predictive areas in the body for a whole cohort of subjects. We show that the investigation of the full 3D volume of the whole body and the population-wide analysis can give important insights into which body parts play the most important roles in predicting a person's age. Our findings reveal three primary areas of interest: the spine, the autochthonous back muscles, and the cardiac region, which exhibits the highest importance. Finally, we investigate differences between subjects that show accelerated and decelerated ageing.</description>

      <title>Adapt and Diffuse: Sample-adaptive Reconstruction via Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in a multitude of applications, where the goal is to recover a clean signal from noisy and possibly (non)linear observations. The difficulty of a reconstruction problem depends on multiple factors, such as the ground truth signal structure, the severity of the degradation and the complex interactions between the above. This results in natural sample-by-sample variation in the difficulty of a reconstruction problem. Our key observation is that most existing inverse problem solvers lack the ability to adapt their compute power to the difficulty of the reconstruction task, resulting in subpar performance and wasteful resource allocation. We propose a novel method, $\textit{severity encoding}$, to estimate the degradation severity of corrupted signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. We show that the estimated severity has strong correlation with the true corruption level and can provide useful hints on the difficulty of reconstruction problems on a sample-by-sample basis. Furthermore, we propose a reconstruction method based on latent diffusion models that leverages the predicted degradation severities to fine-tune the reverse diffusion sampling trajectory and thus achieve sample-adaptive inference times. Our framework, Flash-Diffusion, acts as a wrapper that can be combined with any latent diffusion-based baseline solver, imbuing it with sample-adaptivity and acceleration. We perform experiments on both linear and nonlinear inverse problems and demonstrate that our technique greatly improves the performance of the baseline solver and achieves up to $10\times$ acceleration in mean sampling speed.</description>

      <title>Robust MRI Reconstruction by Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.</description>

      <title>Generative Medical Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in medical image segmentation performance have been significantly driven by the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models follow the discriminative pixel-wise classification learning paradigm and often have limited ability to generalize across diverse medical imaging datasets. In this manuscript, we introduce Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), a novel approach leveraging a generative model to perform image segmentation. Concretely, GMS employs a robust pre-trained vision foundation model to extract latent representations for images and corresponding ground truth masks, followed by a model that learns a mapping function from the image to the mask in the latent space. Once trained, the model generates an estimated segmentation mask using the pre-trained vision foundation model to decode the predicted latent representation back into the image space. The design of GMS leads to fewer trainable parameters in the model which reduces the risk of overfitting and enhances its generalization capability. Our experimental analysis across five public datasets in different medical imaging domains demonstrates GMS outperforms existing discriminative and generative segmentation models. Furthermore, GMS is able to generalize well across datasets from different centers within the same imaging modality. Our experiments suggest GMS offers a scalable and effective solution for medical image segmentation. GMS implementation and trained model weights are available at https://github.com/King-HAW/GMS.</description>

      <title>A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, GMSD, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</description>

      <title>Hibou: A Family of Foundational Vision Transformers for Pathology</title>

Abstract: Pathology, the microscopic examination of diseased tissue, is critical for diagnosing various medical conditions, particularly cancers. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data.
  This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Conditional Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for VHR SAR to Optical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating SAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Computationally Inexpensive Method For Image Translation of 3D Volume Patient Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CycleGAN was trained on SynthRAD Grand Challenge Dataset using the single-epoch modification (SEM) method proposed in this paper which is referred to as (CycleGAN-single) compared to the usual method of training CycleGAN on around 200 epochs (CycleGAN-multi). Model performance were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with quantitative performance metrics like PSNR, SSIM, MAE and MSE. The consideration of both quantitative and qualitative performance when evaluating a model is unique to certain image-translation tasks like medical imaging as detailed in this paper. Also, this paper shows that good quantitative performance does not always imply good qualitative performance and the converse is also not always True (i.e. good qualitative performance does not always imply good quantitative performance). This paper also proposes FQGA (Fast Paired Image-to-Image Translation Quarter-Generator Adversary) Model which has 1/4 the number of parameters compared to CycleGAN (when comparing their Generator Models). FQGA outperforms CycleGAN qualitatively and quantitatively even only after training on 20 epochs. Finally, using SEM method on FQGA allowed it to again outperform CycleGAN both quantitatively and qualitatively. These performance gains with fewer model parameters and time savings from running fewer epochs may also be applicable to other image-to-image translation tasks in Machine Learning apart from the Medical image-translation task discussed in this paper between Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Computed Tomography (CT) images.</description>

      <title>Unified Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at \url{https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/UDASS}.</description>

      <title>WHALE-FL: Wireless and Heterogeneity Aware Latency Efficient Federated Learning over Mobile Devices via Adaptive Subnetwork Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a popular distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) over mobile devices fosters numerous applications, while their practical deployment is hindered by participating devices' computing and communication heterogeneity. Some pioneering research efforts proposed to extract subnetworks from the global model, and assign as large a subnetwork as possible to the device for local training based on its full computing and communications capacity. Although such fixed size subnetwork assignment enables FL training over heterogeneous mobile devices, it is unaware of (i) the dynamic changes of devices' communication and computing conditions and (ii) FL training progress and its dynamic requirements of local training contributions, both of which may cause very long FL training delay. Motivated by those dynamics, in this paper, we develop a wireless and heterogeneity aware latency efficient FL (WHALE-FL) approach to accelerate FL training through adaptive subnetwork scheduling. Instead of sticking to the fixed size subnetwork, WHALE-FL introduces a novel subnetwork selection utility function to capture device and FL training dynamics, and guides the mobile device to adaptively select the subnetwork size for local training based on (a) its computing and communication capacity, (b) its dynamic computing and/or communication conditions, and (c) FL training status and its corresponding requirements for local training contributions. Our evaluation shows that, compared with peer designs, WHALE-FL effectively accelerates FL training without sacrificing learning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network for Video Quality Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06342v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of quality enhancement for compressed videos. Although deep network-based video restorers achieve impressive progress, most of the existing methods lack a structured design to optimally leverage the priors within compression codecs. Since the quality degradation of the video is primarily induced by the compression algorithm, a new paradigm is urgently needed for a more ``conscious'' process of quality enhancement. As a result, we propose the Compression-Realized Deep Structural Network (CRDS), introducing three inductive biases aligned with the three primary processes in the classic compression codec, merging the strengths of classical encoder architecture with deep network capabilities. Inspired by the residual extraction and domain transformation process in the codec, a pre-trained Latent Degradation Residual Auto-Encoder is proposed to transform video frames into a latent feature space, and the mutual neighborhood attention mechanism is integrated for precise motion estimation and residual extraction. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the quantization noise distribution of the codec, CRDS proposes a novel Progressive Denoising framework with intermediate supervision that decomposes the quality enhancement into a series of simpler denoising sub-tasks. Experimental results on datasets like LDV 2.0 and MFQE 2.0 indicate our approach surpasses state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.</description>

      <title>Screen Them All: High-Throughput Pan-Cancer Genetic and Phenotypic Biomarker Screening from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many molecular alterations serve as clinically prognostic or therapy-predictive biomarkers, typically detected using single or multi-gene molecular assays. However, these assays are expensive, tissue destructive and often take weeks to complete. Using AI on routine H&amp;E WSIs offers a fast and economical approach to screen for multiple molecular biomarkers. We present a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2, a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million slides, to interrogate genomic features previously determined by an next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, using 47,960 scanned hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSIs) from 38,984 cancer patients. Unlike traditional methods that train individual models for each biomarker or cancer type, our system employs a unified model to simultaneously predict a wide range of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers across cancer types. By training the network to replicate the MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel of 505 genes, it identified 80 high performing biomarkers with a mean AU-ROC of 0.89 in 15 most common cancer types. In addition, 40 biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with specific cancer histologic subtypes. Furthermore, 58 biomarkers were associated with targets frequently assayed clinically for therapy selection and response prediction. The model can also predict the activity of five canonical signaling pathways, identify defects in DNA repair mechanisms, and predict genomic instability measured by tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability (MSI), and chromosomal instability (CIN). The proposed model can offer potential to guide therapy selection, improve treatment efficacy, accelerate patient screening for clinical trials and provoke the interrogation of new therapeutic targets.</description>

      <title>HYDEN: Hyperbolic Density Representations for Medical Images and Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the inherent entailment relations between images and text, hyperbolic point vector embeddings, leveraging the hierarchical modeling advantages of hyperbolic space, have been utilized for visual semantic representation learning. However, point vector embedding approaches fail to address the issue of semantic uncertainty, where an image may have multiple interpretations, and text may refer to different images, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in the medical domain. Therefor, we propose \textbf{HYDEN}, a novel hyperbolic density embedding based image-text representation learning approach tailored for specific medical domain data. This method integrates text-aware local features alongside global features from images, mapping image-text features to density features in hyperbolic space via using hyperbolic pseudo-Gaussian distributions. An encapsulation loss function is employed to model the partial order relations between image-text density distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the interpretability of our approach and its superior performance compared to the baseline methods across various zero-shot tasks and different datasets.</description>
