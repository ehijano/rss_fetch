      <title>Evaluation of the linear mixing model in fluorescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of spectral data often assume a linear mixing hypothesis, which states that the spectrum of a mixed substance is approximately the mixture of the individual spectra of its constituent parts. We evaluate this hypothesis in the context of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence spectroscopy for endmember abundance recovery from mixtures of three different DOM endmembers. We quantify two key sources of experimental variation, and statistically evaluate the linear mixing hypotheses in the context of this variation. We find that there is not strong statistical evidence against this hypothesis for high-fluorescence readings, and that true abundances of high-fluorescence endmembers are accurately recovered from the excitation-emission fluorescence spectra of mixed samples using linear methods. However, abundances of a low-fluorescence endmember are less well-estimated, in that the abundance coefficient estimates exhibit a high degree of variability across replicate experiments.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Influenza Hospitalizations Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Nonlinear Model with Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The annual influenza outbreak leads to significant public health and economic burdens making it desirable to have prompt and accurate probabilistic forecasts of the disease spread. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hosts annually a national flu forecasting competition which has led to the development of a variety of flu forecast modeling methods. Beginning in 2013, the target to be forecast was weekly percentage of patients with an influenza-like illness (ILI), but in 2021 the target was changed to weekly hospitalizations. Reliable hospitalization data has only been available since 2021, but ILI data has been available since 2010 and has been successfully forecast for several seasons. In this manuscript, we introduce a two component modeling framework for forecasting hospitalizations utilizing both hospitalization and ILI data. The first component is for modeling ILI data using a nonlinear Bayesian model. The second component is for modeling hospitalizations as a function of ILI. For hospitalization forecasts, ILI is first forecast then hospitalizations are forecast with ILI forecasts used as a predictor. In a simulation study, the hospitalization forecast model is assessed and two previously successful ILI forecast models are compared. Also assessed is the usefulness of including a systematic model discrepancy term in the ILI model. Forecasts of state and national hospitalizations for the 2023-24 flu season are made, and different modeling decisions are compared. We found that including a discrepancy component in the ILI model tends to improve forecasts during certain weeks of the year. We also found that other modeling decisions such as the exact nonlinear function to be used in the ILI model or the error distribution for hospitalization models may or may not be better than other decisions, depending on the season, location, or week of the forecast.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the first fully quantitative distance matrix visualization methods was proposed by Jan Czekanowski at the beginning of the previous century. Recently, a software package, RMaCzek, was made available that allows for producing such diagrams in R. Here we reanalyze the original data that Czekanowski used for introducing his method, and in the accompanying code show how the user can specify their own custom distance functions in the package.</description>

      <title>MICG-AI: A multidimensional index of child growth based on digital phenotyping with Bayesian artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document proposes an algorithm for a mobile application designed to monitor multidimensional child growth through digital phenotyping. Digital phenotyping offers a unique opportunity to collect and analyze high-frequency data in real time, capturing behavioral, psychological, and physiological states of children in naturalistic settings. Traditional models of child growth primarily focus on physical metrics, often overlooking multidimensional aspects such as emotional, social, and cognitive development. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that leverages digital phenotyping to create a Multidimensional Index of Child Growth (MICG). This index integrates data from various dimensions of child development, including physical, emotional, cognitive, and environmental factors. By incorporating probabilistic modeling, the proposed algorithm dynamically updates its learning based on data collected by the mobile app used by mothers and children. The app also infers uncertainty from response times, adjusting the importance of each dimension of child growth accordingly. Our contribution applies state-of-the-art technology to track multidimensional child development, enabling families and healthcare providers to make more informed decisions in real time.</description>

      <title>A linear regression model for quantile function data applied to paired pulmonary 3d CT scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new objective measure for assessing treatment response in asthmatic patients using computed tomography (CT) imaging data. For each patient, CT scans were obtained before and after one year of monoclonal antibody treatment. Following image segmentation, the Hounsfield unit (HU) values of the voxels were encoded through quantile functions. It is hypothesized that patients with improved conditions after treatment will exhibit better expiration, reflected in higher HU values and an upward shift in the quantile curve. To objectively measure treatment response, a novel linear regression model on quantile functions is developed, drawing inspiration from Verde and Irpino (2010). Unlike their framework, the proposed model is parametric and incorporates distributional assumptions on the errors, enabling statistical inference. The model allows for the explicit calculation of regression coefficient estimators and confidence intervals, similar to conventional linear regression. The corresponding data and R code are available on GitHub to facilitate the reproducibility of the analyses presented.</description>

      <title>Digital N-of-1 Trials and their Application in Experimental Physiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, studies in experimental physiology have been conducted in small groups of human participants, animal models or cell lines. Important challenges include achieving sufficient statistical power in statistical hypothesis tests of small sample sizes and identifying optimal study designs. Here, we introduce N-of-1 trials as an innovative study design which can have high relevance to innovate and improve studies in experimental physiology. N-of-1 trials are multi-crossover trials in single participants that allow valid statistical inference on the individual level. Also, series of N-of-1 trials conducted on multiple study participants can be aggregated for population-level inference and provide a more efficient study design compared to standard randomized controlled trials. In this manuscript, we first introduce key components and design features of N-of-1 trials. Then we lay out how N-of-1 trials can be analyzed statistically and give different examples of their applicability in experimental physiological studies. In summary, we provide here an overview of all main components for designing N-of-1 trials, give direct examples in experimental physiology and practical recommendations on their proper use.</description>

      <title>The Estimand Framework and Causal Inference: Complementary not Competing Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The creation of the ICH E9 (R1) estimands framework has led to more precise specification of the treatment effects of interest in the design and statistical analysis of clinical trials. However, it is unclear how the new framework relates to causal inference, as both approaches appear to define what is being estimated and have a quantity labelled an estimand. Using illustrative examples, we show that both approaches can be used to define a population-based summary of an effect on an outcome for a specified population and highlight the similarities and differences between these approaches. We demonstrate that the ICH E9 (R1) estimand framework offers a descriptive, structured approach that is more accessible to non-mathematicians, facilitating clearer communication of trial objectives and results. We then contrast this with the causal inference framework, which provides a mathematically precise definition of an estimand, and allows the explicit articulation of assumptions through tools such as causal graphs. Despite these differences, the two paradigms should be viewed as complementary rather than competing. The combined use of both approaches enhances the ability to communicate what is being estimated. We encourage those familiar with one framework to appreciate the concepts of the other to strengthen the robustness and clarity of clinical trial design, analysis, and interpretation.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, data science agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), known as "data agents," have shown significant potential to transform the traditional data analysis paradigm. This survey provides an overview of the evolution, capabilities, and applications of LLM-based data agents, highlighting their role in simplifying complex data tasks and lowering the entry barrier for users without related expertise. We explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to advance the development of data agents into intelligent statistical analysis software.</description>

      <title>Joint Models for Handling Non-Ignorable Missing Data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees: Application to Leaf Photosynthetic Traits Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dealing with missing data poses significant challenges in predictive analysis, often leading to biased conclusions when oversimplified assumptions about the missing data process are made. In cases where the data are missing not at random (MNAR), jointly modeling the data and missing data indicators is essential. Motivated by a real data application with partially missing multivariate outcomes related to leaf photosynthetic traits and several environmental covariates, we propose two methods under a selection model framework for handling data with missingness in the response variables suitable for recovering various missingness mechanisms. Both approaches use a multivariate extension of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly model the outcomes. The first approach simultaneously uses a probit regression model to jointly model the missingness. In scenarios where the relationship between the missingness and the data is more complex or non-linear, we propose a second approach using a probit BART model to characterize the missing data process, thereby employing two BART models simultaneously. Both models also effectively handle ignorable covariate missingness. The efficacy of both models compared to existing missing data approaches is demonstrated through extensive simulations, in both univariate and multivariate settings, and through the aforementioned application to the leaf photosynthetic trait data.</description>

      <title>Improving the Balance of Unobserved Covariates From Information Theory in Multi-Arm Randomization with Unequal Allocation Ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-arm randomization has increasingly widespread applications recently and it is also crucial to ensure that the distributions of important observed covariates as well as the potential unobserved covariates are similar and comparable among all the treatment. However, the theoretical properties of unobserved covariates imbalance in multi-arm randomization with unequal allocation ratio remains unknown. In this paper, we give a general framework analysing the moments and distributions of unobserved covariates imbalance and apply them into different procedures including complete randomization (CR), stratified permuted block (STR-PB) and covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR). The general procedures of multi-arm STR-PB and CAR with unequal allocation ratio are also proposed. In addition, we introduce the concept of entropy to measure the correlation between discrete covariates and verify that we could utilize the correlation to select observed covariates to help better balance the unobserved covariates.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Sea Level Spatial Variability by Topological Indicators and $k$-means Clustering Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-series data of sea level rise and fall contains crucial information on the variability of sea level patterns. Traditional $k$-means clustering is commonly used for categorizing regional variability of sea level, however, its results are not robust against a number of factors. This study analyzed fourteen datasets of monthly sea level in fourteen shoreline regions of Peninsular Malaysia. We applied a hybridization of clustering technique to analyze data categorization and topological data analysis method to enhance the performance of our clustering analysis. Specifically, our approach utilized the persistent homology and $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. The fourteen data sets from fourteen tide gauge stations were categorized in classes based on a prior categorization that was determined by topological information, and the probability of data points that belong to certain groups that is yielded by $k$-means/$k$-means++ clustering. Our results demonstrated that our method significantly improves the performance of traditional clustering techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective policy and intervention strategies to combat human trafficking for child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) production require accurate prevalence estimates. Traditional Network Scale Up Method (NSUM) models often necessitate standalone surveys for each geographic region, escalating costs and complexity. This study introduces a partially pooled NSUM model, using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that efficiently aggregates and utilizes data across multiple regions without increasing sample sizes. We developed this model for a novel national survey dataset from the Philippines and we demonstrate its ability to produce detailed municipal-level prevalence estimates of trafficking for CSEM production. Our results not only underscore the model's precision in estimating hidden populations but also highlight its potential for broader application in other areas of social science and public health research, offering significant implications for resource allocation and intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Predicting Value at Risk for Cryptocurrencies With Generalized Random Forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the prediction of Value at Risk (VaR) for cryptocurrencies. In contrast to classic assets, returns of cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile and characterized by large fluctuations around single events. Analyzing a comprehensive set of 105 major cryptocurrencies, we show that Generalized Random Forests (GRF) (Athey, Tibshirani &amp; Wager, 2019) adapted to quantile prediction have superior performance over other established methods such as quantile regression, GARCH-type and CAViaR models. This advantage is especially pronounced in unstable times and for classes of highly-volatile cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we identify important predictors during such times and show their influence on forecasting over time. Moreover, a comprehensive simulation study also indicates that the GRF methodology is at least on par with existing methods in VaR predictions for standard types of financial returns and clearly superior in the cryptocurrency setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a basic model in which the dynamic of the transaction prices is a geometric Brownian motion disrupted by a microstructure white noise, corresponding to the random alternation of bids and asks, we propose moment-based estimators along with their statistical properties. We then make the model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a geometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence, we propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our estimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as Roll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Interactions of Multiple Driver States in Heterogenous Population and Cognitive Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world driving scenarios, multiple states occur simultaneously due to individual differences and environmental factors, complicating the analysis and estimation of driver states. Previous studies, limited by experimental design and analytical methods, may not be able to disentangle the relationships among multiple driver states and environmental factors. This paper introduces the Double Machine Learning (DML) analysis method to the field of driver state analysis to tackle this challenge. To train and test the DML model, a driving simulator experiment with 42 participants was conducted. All participants drove SAE level-3 vehicles and conducted three types of cognitive tasks in a 3-hour driving experiment. Drivers' subjective cognitive load and drowsiness levels were collected throughout the experiment. Then, we isolated individual and environmental factors affecting driver state variations and the factors affecting drivers' physiological and eye-tracking metrics when they are under specific states. The results show that our approach successfully decoupled and inferred the complex causal relationships between multiple types of drowsiness and cognitive load. Additionally, we identified key physiological and eye-tracking indicators in the presence of multiple driver states and under the influence of a single state, excluding the influence of other driver states, environmental factors, and individual characteristics. Our causal inference analytical framework can offer new insights for subsequent analysis of drivers' states. Further, the updated causal relation graph based on the DML analysis can provide theoretical bases for driver state monitoring based on physiological and eye-tracking measures.</description>
