      <title>Magnetism in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory, we show that the recently observed ferromagnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ [Nat. Commun. 16, 1959 (2025)] can be understood as a Stoner-like instability of interaction-renormalized moir\'e bands. We quantitatively reproduce the observed Lifshitz transition as function of hole filling and applied electric field that marks the boundary between layer-hybridized and layer-polarized regimes. The former supports a ferromagnetic valley-polarized ground state below half-filling, developing a topological charge gap at half-filling for small twists. At larger twist angles there is a transition to a gapped triangular N\'eel antiferromagnet. The layer-polarized regime supports a stripe antiferromagnet below half-filling and a wing-shaped multiferroic ground state above half-filling. We map the evolution of these states as a function of filling factor, electric field, twist angle, and interaction strength. Beyond providing an understanding of recent experiments, our methodology is applicable to a broad class of moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>"Berry Trashcan" Model of Interacting Electrons in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for interacting electrons in a continuum band structure that resembles a ``trashcan'', with a flat bottom of radius $k_b$ beyond which the dispersion increases rapidly with velocity $v$. The form factors of the Bloch wavefunctions can be well-approximated by the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, which encodes the uniform Berry curvature. We demonstrate how this model captures the salient features of the low-energy Hamiltonian for electron-doped pristine $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene (R$n$G) for appropriate values of the displacement field, and provide corresponding expressions for $k_b$. In the regime where the Fermi wavevector is close to $k_b$, we analytically solve the Hartree-Fock equations for a gapped Wigner crystal in several limits of the model. We introduce a new method, the sliver-patch approximation, which extends the previous few-patch approaches and is crucial in both differentiating even vs odd Chern numbers of the ground state and gapping the Hartree-Fock solution. A key parameter is the Berry flux $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ enclosed by the (flat) bottom of the band. We analytically show that there is a ferromagnetic coupling between the signs of $\varphi_{\text{BZ}}$ and the Chern number $C$ of the putative Wigner crystal. We also study the competition between the $C=0$ and $1$ solutions as a function of the interaction potential for parameters relevant to R$n$G. By exhaustive comparison to numerical Hartree-Fock calculations, we demonstrate how the analytic results capture qualitative trends of the phase diagram, as well as quantitative details such as the enhancement of the effective velocity. Our analysis paves the way for an analytic and numerical examination of the stability and competition beyond mean-field theory of the Wigner crystals in this model.</description>

      <title>Modified large-$N$ approach to gapless spin liquids, magnetic orders, and dynamics: Application to triangular lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the triangular lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg and XXZ antiferromagnets may exhibit coplanar or supersolid orders proximate to a gapless Dirac spin liquid phase. We explore a distinct $SU(2N)\!\!\times\!\!SU(M)$ fermionic parton approach, complemented by variational Monte Carlo calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, to study the phase diagram of these models. We also calculate their dynamical spin response including parton interactions within a random phase approximation, and discuss implications for neutron scattering on triangular lattice cobaltates Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, and Yb-based magnet KYbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation corrections to the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the free energy of strongly correlated electron systems in the example of the Hubbard model by calculating the contribution of spin and charge fluctuations to the Gutzwiller approximation mean field result. We employ the slave boson formulation of Kotliar and Ruckenstein in its spin-rotation invariant form in the usual continuous time approximation of the functional integral representation, corrected by "high frequency contributions" (SRIKR+). Previous method-related shortcomings are shown to be overcome when the correct operator ordering for the renormalized kinetic energy is used. The results for the ground state energy in the paramagnetic phase are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art results obtained by methods such as density matrix embedded theory (DMET), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and others. The leading low temperature behavior of the free energy allows to extract the quasiparticle effective mass, in particular its enhancement near a continuous phase transition into an ordered state. Our work demonstrates that the SRIKR+ method is competitive with the best available alternative methods and equips the slave-boson approach with an improved synoptic power to explore strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Kagome Origin of the Strange Metallicity in Ni$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong correlations promote singular properties such as strange metallicity, which shows considerable commonality across quantum materials platforms. Understanding the mechanism for such emerging universality is an outstanding challenge, given that the underlying degrees of freedom can be complex and varied. Progress may be made in flat band systems, especially kagome and other frustrated-lattice metals with active flat bands. These systems show strange metal behavior that bears a striking resemblance to what happens in heavy-fermion metals. Here, in scanning tunneling spectroscopy of kagome metal Ni$_3$In, we find a zero-bias peak-dip structure whose variation with magnetic field and temperature tracks the evolution of the strange metal properties. We identify the origin of the peak as compact molecular orbitals formed by destructive interference over the kagome sites, resulting in emergent $f$-shell-like localized moments. Using quasi-particle interference, we visualize their interaction with the Dirac light bands. We thus unveil the essential microscopic ingredients of the $d$-electron-based kagome metals that, while distinct from the atomic orbitals of the $f$-electron-based heavy fermion materials, are responsible for a shared phenomenology between the two types of systems. Our findings provide a new window to uncover and interconnect the essential and yet diverse microscopic building blocks in disparate families of quantum materials that drive a convergence towards a universal understanding in the regime of amplified quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Altermagnets with topological order in Kitaev bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent advancements in altermagnetism, we develop a highly-frustrated magnetic model with Kitaev-like interactions that integrates key aspects of both quantum spin liquids and altermagnets. While the ground state is a gapless quantum spin liquid, our analysis indicates that an altermagnetic local order emerges upon the introduction of additional interactions that gap the excitation spectrum and give rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological order. This magnetically-fragmented topological altermagnet has fractionalized fermionic excitations with momentum-dependent splitting, in stark contrast to both standard altermagnets and Kitaev spin liquids. In addition, we discover two more altermagnetic phases, including a pseudo-altermagnet that exhibits splitting in the absence of a local order and a half-altermagnet that possesses only one type of fractionalized excitations, similar to a half-metal. We discuss experimental approaches for detecting these phases, including layer-dependent spin and heat transport. Our results highlight the rich physics that can arise due to the interplay between altermagnetism and fractionalized excitations in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Correlated flat-band physics in a bilayer kagome metal based on compact molecular orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands, when located close to the Fermi energy, can considerably enhance the influence of electron correlations on the low energy physics in kagome and other frustrated-lattice metals. A major challenge in describing the interaction effects in such bulk materials is that the flat band is often intermixed with a large number of other bands. Here we show that the recently introduced notion of compact molecular orbitals (CMOs) enable a path forward in describing the dominant effect of the Coulomb interactions in spite of the complexity of the bandstructure. Our materials-based analysis allows for the understanding of the scanning-tunneling-microscopy experiment [J. C. Souza et al., preprint (2024)] of the bilayer kagome metal Ni$_3$In in terms of the CMO notion. From the resulting CMO, an effective Anderson lattice model can be set up. This CMO-based approach enables the calculation of correlation effects that is difficult to do based on the atomic orbitals. Furthermore, it suggests an enriched phase diagram for the strange metal physics of the kagome metal, which can be tested by future experiments. We discuss the implications of our results for the general correlation physics of flat band systems and beyond.</description>

      <title>Generalized Peierls substitution for Wannier obstructions: response to disorder and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals,this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>

      <title>Disentangling anomaly-free symmetries of quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify the lore that anomaly-free symmetries are either on-site or can be transformed into on-site symmetries. We prove that any finite, internal, anomaly-free symmetry in a 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian system can be disentangled into an on-site symmetry by introducing ancillas and applying conjugation via a finite-depth quantum circuit. We provide an explicit construction of the disentangling circuit using Gauss's law operators and emphasize the necessity of adding ancillas. Our result establishes the converse to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by demonstrating that any anomaly-free symmetry admits a trivially gapped Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Crystal field splittings and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on Density-Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum embedding methods enable the study of large, strongly correlated quantum systems by (usually self-consistent) decomposition into computationally manageable subproblems, in the spirit of divide-and-conquer methods. Among these, Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) is an efficient approach that enforces self-consistency at the level of one-particle reduced density matrices (1-RDMs), facilitating applications across diverse quantum systems. However, conventional DMET is constrained by the requirement that the global 1-RDM (low-level descriptor) be an orthogonal projector, limiting flexibility in bath construction and potentially impeding accuracy in strongly correlated regimes. In this work, we introduce a generalized DMET framework in which the low-level descriptor can be an arbitrary 1-RDM and the bath construction is based on optimizing a quantitative criterion related to the maximal disentanglement between different fragments. This yields an alternative yet controllable bath space construction for generic 1-RDMs, lifting a key limitation of conventional DMET. We demonstrate its consistency with conventional DMET in appropriate limits and exploring its implications for bath construction, downfolding (impurity Hamiltonian construction), low-level solvers, and adaptive fragmentation. We expect that this more flexible framework, which leads to several new variants of DMET, can improve the robustness and accuracy of DMET.</description>

      <title>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Liquid phases in Kitaev Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-invariant renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) method, to reliably find the quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and their field response in realistic Kitaev materials. Remarkably, while our RMFT reproduces previous results based on more complicated numerical methods, it also predicts several new stable QSL states. In particular, since Kitaev spin liquid(KSL) is no longer a saddle point solution, a new exotic 2-cone state distinct from the KSL, is found to describe the experimental observations well, and hence the candidate state be realized in the Kitaev material, {\alpha}-RuCl3. We further explore the mechanism for the suppression of the observed thermal Hall conductivity at low temperatures within the fermionic framework, and show the theoretical polarangle dependence of fermionic gap that can distinguish the found 2-cone state from the KSL state in further experiment.</description>

      <title>Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.</description>

      <title>Observation of the dimer-singlet phase in the one-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet Cu(Ampy)ClBr (Ampy= C6H8N2 = 2-(Aminomethyl)pyridine)</title>

Abstract: Spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic frustrated spin chain systems display exotic ground states with unconventional excitations and distinct quantum phase transitions as the ratio of next-nearest-neighbor to nearest-neighbor coupling is tuned. We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamics properties of the spin-1/2 compound, Cu(Ampy)ClBr (Ampy= C6H8N2 = 2-(Aminomethyl)pyridine) via x-ray diffraction, magnetization, specific heat, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR), and muon spin relaxation (muSR) techniques. The crystal structure features an anisotropic triangular chain lattice of magnetic Cu2+ ions. Our bulk and local probe experiments detect neither long-range magnetic ordering nor spin freezing down to 0.06 K despite the presence of moderate antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ spins as reflected by a Curie-Weiss temperature of about -9 K from the bulk susceptibility data. A broad maximum is observed at about 9 K in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data, indicating the onset of short-range spin correlations. At low temperatures, the zero-field magnetic specific heat and the 1H NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follow an exponential temperature dependence, indicating the presence of gapped magnetic excitations. Furthermore, persistent spin dynamics down to 0.088 K observed by zero-field muSR evidences lack of any static magnetism. We attribute these experimental results to the stabilization of a dimer-singlet phase in the presence of a next-near neighbor interaction and of a randomness in the exchange coupling driven by Cl/Br mixing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response theory of interacting Majorana fermions and its application to generic Kitaev quantum spin liquids in a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the appearance of Majorana fermions in a broad range of correlated and topological electronic systems, we develop a general method to compute the dynamical response of interacting Majorana fermions in the random-phase approximation (RPA). This can be applied self-consistently on top of Majorana mean-field theory (MFT) backgrounds, thereby in particular providing a powerful tool to analyse $\textit{generic}$ behaviour in the vicinity of (various heavily studied) exactly soluble models. Prime examples are quantum spin liquids (QSL) with emergent Majorana excitations, with the celebrated exact solution of Kitaev. We employ the RPA to study in considerable detail phase structure and dynamics of the extended Kitaev honeycomb $KJ\Gamma$-model, with and without an applied field. First, we benchmark our method with Kitaev's exactly soluble model, finding a remarkable agreement. The interactions between Majorana fermions even turn out to mimic the effect of local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations, which we explain analytically. Second, we show how small non-Kitaev couplings $J$ and $\Gamma$ induce Majorana bound states, resulting in sharp features in the dynamical structure factor in the presence of fractionalisation: such 'spinon excitons' naturally appear, and can coexist and interact with the broad Majorana continuum. Third, for increasing couplings or field, our theory predicts instabilities of the KQSL triggered by the condensation of the sharp modes. From the high symmetry momenta of the condensation we can deduce which magnetically ordered phases surround the KQSL, in good agreement with previous finite-size numerics. We discuss implications for experiments and the broad range of applicability of our method to other QSL and Majorana systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory: a real-space quantum embedding approach to disorder in strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum embedding algorithm in real-space for the simultaneous theoretical treatment of nonlocal electronic correlations and disorder, the coherent cellular dynamical mean-field theory (C-CDMFT). This algorithm combines the molecular coherent potential approximation with the cellular dynamical mean-field theory. After a pedagogical introduction to quantum embedding theories for disordered and interacting electron systems, and a detailed discussion of its work flow, we present first results from C-CDMFT for the half-filled two-dimensional Anderson-Hubbard model on a square lattice: (i) the analysis of its Mott metal-insulator transition as a function of disorder strength, and (ii) the impact of different types of disorder on its magnetic phase diagram. For the latter, by means of a "disorder diagnostics", we are able to precisely identify the contributions of different disorder configurations to the system's magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Dark Matter via Global Anomaly Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the sterile right-handed neutrino $\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry. Including $\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather than a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative global anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these gauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ that are enhanced from the fermion parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\bf B} \pm {\bf L}$ discreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the family number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap preserving the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios canceling $({\bf B} \pm {\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped topological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions) or gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous sectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the $N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\rm F}$ representation from the faithful ${\bf B} + {\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the faithful ${\bf Q} + N_c {\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry extension matches with the topological order dark matter construction. Key implications include: (1) a 5th force mediating between SM and dark matter via discrete gauge fields. (2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with gapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition takes place between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>Topotactic Reduction-Driven Crystal Field Excitations in Brownmillerite Manganite Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topotactic reduction of perovskite oxides offers a powerful approach for discovering novel phenomena, such as superconducting infinite-layer nickelates and polar metallicity, and is commonly accompanied by the emergence of multiple valence states and/or complex crystal fields of transition metals. However, understanding the complex interplay between crystal chemistry, electronic structure, and physical properties at the spin- and orbital-resolved levels in these reduced systems remains elusive. Here, we combine x-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), and density functional theory calculations to uncover topotactic metal-insulator transition and orbital-specific crystal field excitations in brownmillerite La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 thin films. We reveal the Mn valence states to be predominantly Mn2+/Mn3+, along with their corresponding populations at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, which effectively weaken the Mn-O hybridization compared to the parent perovskite phase. As a result, La0.67Ca0.33MnO2.5 films exhibit an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state. Moreover, by combining the RIXS measurements on selected single-valence manganites, specifically MnO, LaMnO3, and CaMnO3, with orbital- and spin-resolved density-of-states calculations, we identify the dd excitations of octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated Mn2+/Mn3+ ions, directly linking the microscopic electronic structure to the macroscopic magnetic/electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B&gt;B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B&lt;B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Current-linear emergent induction of pinned skyrmion textures in an oxide bilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent electromagnetic induction (EEMI) induced through current-driven spin dynamics was recently predicted and subsequently observed in helical spin magnets, opening a new direction in spintronics and paving the way towards further miniaturization of electronic circuit elements. In contrast to conventional inductors consisting of coil-like structures whose inductance $L$ shows a linear dependence on the cross-section $A$, emergent inductors exhibit an inverse ($\propto {A}^{-1}$) proportionality, favorable for the miniaturization of electrical devices. However, the expected current-linear response of the EEMI voltage has not been demonstrated. Magnetic skyrmions hold promise as a simple platform to study the conceptual foundations of EEMI from current-driven spin dynamics. We fabricated devices of thin film bilayers of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_3$ and paramagnetic SrIrO$_3$, which are known to host interfacial N\'eel skyrmions detected by the appearance of a topological Hall-effect (THE). A large, positive and current-linear inductive response is found to accompany the THE. In our experiment, the current-induced dynamics of pinned magnetic skyrmions creates a voltage both parallel and perpendicular to the applied electric current flow, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse induction, respectively. This is the first report of transverse EEMI, indicating an angle of $80^{\circ}$ between skyrmion motion and the applied current. Our observation of current-linear longitudinal and transverse EEMI is a hallmark of pinned dynamics of magnetic skyrmion textures in oxide heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism to explain the emergence of an intermediate gapless spin liquid phase in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in an externally applied magnetic field, sandwiched between the well-known gapped chiral spin liquid and the gapped partially polarized phase. We propose that, in moderate fields, $\pi$-fluxes nucleate in the ground state and trap Majorana zero modes. As these fluxes proliferate with increasing field, the Majorana zero modes overlap creating an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum Majorana metallic state with a `Fermi surface' at zero energy. We further show that the Majorana spectral function captures the dynamical spin and dimer correlations obtained by the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States method, thereby validating our variational approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic ordering is prevalent in correlated systems, which commonly exhibit competing interactions. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to demonstrate a cascade of pressure induced order-disorder transformations, with propagation vectors $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$= $\left(\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$, $\mathbf{q}^*$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{2}\right)$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$, in the kagome metal FeGe. In the pressure interval between 4$&lt;p&lt;$10 GPa, $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$ and $\mathbf{q}^*$ coexist and the spatial extent of the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ order is nearly long-range at $\sim$15 GPa, $\sim$30 unit cells. Above $\sim$25 GPa, the periodic lattice distortion has a propagation wavevector of $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$=$\left(\frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\ \frac{1}{3}\right)$ at room temperature. The cascade of phase transitions are captured by the Ising model of frustrated triangular lattices and modeled by Monte Carlo simulations based on the dimerization of trigonal Ge$_1$. The pressure dependence of the integrated intensities and correlation lengths of $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CDW}$, $\mathbf{q}^*$ and $\mathbf{q}^\dagger$ demonstrate a competition between the 2$\times$2 and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ phases prove the tunability of order-disorder phase transitions under pressure and the rich landscape of metastable/fragile phases of FeGe.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, spin-orbit interaction and electron-phonon coupling of triangular adatom lattices on semiconductor substrates</title>

Abstract: A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a $T_c$ between 5K and 9K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials we compute relativistic bandstructures using DFT+$U$ where $U$ is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band differ substantially compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001) we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.</description>

      <title>Static structure factor and the dispersion of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density mode for fractional quantum Hall fluids on the Haldane sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the neutral excitations in the bulk of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids generated by acting with the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density operator on the uniform ground state. Creating these density modulations atop the ground state costs energy, since any density fluctuation in the FQH system has a gap stemming from underlying interparticle interactions. We calculate the GMP density-mode dispersion for many bosonic and fermionic FQH states on the Haldane sphere using the ground state static structure factor computed on the same geometry. Previously, this computation was carried out on the plane. Analogous to the GMP algebra of the lowest Landau level (LLL) projected density operators in the plane, we derive the algebra for the LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which facilitates the computation of the density-mode dispersion. Contrary to previous results on the plane, we find that, in the long-wavelength limit, the GMP mode accurately describes the dynamics of the primary Jain states.</description>

      <title>Dumbbell Fermions and Spin Models on Honeycomb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Angular Dependence of Specific Heat and Magnetization Effects in the Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a magnetic field on the Kitaev model using the equation of motion approach for the spin Green's function. Our study considers both cases: suppressed magnetization and finite magnetization in the paramagnetic phase of the Kitaev model. When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits an angular dependence with a $60^\circ$ periodicity, consistent with recent experimental observations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This behavior can be interpreted as a signature of Majorana fermion gap formation. However, when magnetization is included, the periodicity shifts from $60^\circ$ to $180^\circ$, suggesting that the Majorana fermion gap behavior is no longer present in this regime. Our results indicate that the suppression of magnetization is essential for observing features associated with Majorana fermions, suggesting that a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction could contribute to this suppression.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Topological stabilizer models on continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of two-dimensional topological stabilizer codes on continuous variable (CV) degrees of freedom, which generalize homological rotor codes and the toric-GKP code. Our topological codes are built using the concept of boson condensation -- we start from a parent stabilizer code based on an $\mathbb{R}$ gauge theory and condense various bosonic excitations. This produces a large class of topological CV stabilizer codes, including ones that are characterized by the anyon theories of $U(1)_{2n}\times U(1)_{-2m}$ Chern-Simons theories, for arbitrary pairs of positive integers $(n,m)$. Most notably, this includes anyon theories that are non-chiral and nevertheless do not admit a gapped boundary. It is widely believed that such anyon theories cannot be realized by any stabilizer model on finite-dimensional systems. We conjecture that these CV codes go beyond codes obtained from concatenating a topological qudit code with a local encoding into CVs, and thus, constitute the first example of topological codes that are intrinsic to CV systems. Moreover, we study the Hamiltonians associated to the topological CV stabilizer codes and show that, although they have a gapless spectrum, they can become gapped with the addition of a quadratic perturbation. We show that similar methods can be used to construct a gapped Hamiltonian whose anyon theory agrees with a $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory. Our work initiates the study of scalable stabilizer codes that are intrinsic to CV systems and highlights how error-correcting codes can be used to design and analyze many-body systems of CVs that model lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological Constraints on Defect Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended objects (defects) in Quantum Field Theory exhibit rich, nontrivial dynamics describing a variety of physical phenomena. These systems often involve strong coupling at long distances, where the bulk and defects interact, making analytical studies challenging. By carefully analyzing the behavior of bulk symmetries in the presence of defects, we uncover robust topological constraints on defect RG flows. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $\textit{defect anomalies}$ and $\textit{symmetry reflecting defects}$, both of which are RG-invariant. Several known notions, such as higher-form symmetries, fractionalization, and projective lines, are revealed to be manifestations of defect anomalies, which also encompass novel phenomena and forbid trivial defect dynamics in the IR. Meanwhile, symmetry reflecting defects are shown to remain coupled at low energies, imposing powerful dynamical constraints. We verify our findings through concrete examples: exactly solvable defect RG flows in (1+1)d Conformal Field Theories with symmetry reflecting lines and a surface defect in (2+1)d scalar QED.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.</description>
