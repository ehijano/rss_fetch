      <title>K-DRIFT Science Theme: Illuminating the Next Era of Galaxy Cluster Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) is a pioneering instrument designed to explore low-surface-brightness (LSB) phenomena. This white paper presents a compelling array of science cases that showcase K-DRIFT's unique capabilities in unraveling the mysteries of intracluster light (ICL) and other LSB components within galaxy clusters. Exploring the origin of ICL in galaxy clusters and comparing the spatial distributions of ICL and dark matter will offer new insights into galaxy cluster dynamics. Moreover, investigating LSB objects in galaxy clusters, such as LSB structures in the brightest cluster galaxy, ultra-diffuse galaxies, and tidal features, will enhance our understanding of galaxy evolution within the cluster environment. We present our strategies for addressing scientific queries, encompassing LSB observation and analysis techniques, specialized simulations, and machine-learning approaches. Additionally, we examine the potential synergies between K-DRIFT and other ongoing or forthcoming multi-wavelength surveys. This white paper advocates for the recognition and support of K-DRIFT as a dedicated tool for advancing our understanding of the universe's subtlest phenomena.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Magnetization of Super-Alfv\'enic Turbulence with the Structure Functions of Gradient Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Alfv\'enic turbulence is widespread in astrophysical environments, including molecular clouds and the diffuse plasma of galaxy clusters. At large scales, magnetic fields play only a minor dynamical role; however, for sufficiently extended turbulent cascades, the motions transition into the MHD regime at a characteristic scale $l_A$. We introduce a new diagnostic based on the structure functions of the gradient directions, which can be obtained directly from spectroscopic and synchrotron intensity observations. We demonstrate that the new measure robustly recovers the transition scale $l_A$. Building on this result, we propose a generalized expression that replaces the traditional Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method for estimating magnetic field strength in the super-Alfv\'enic regime, where the DCF approach fails. We further show how the magnetization and magnetic field strength of diffuse media, such as the intracluster medium, can be inferred using synchrotron intensity maps. Our theoretical predictions are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Lyman Continuum escaping from in-situ formed stars in a tidal bridge at z = 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to account for reionization of the early Universe, galaxies at that time must have had significantly higher escape fractions of Lyman Continuum (LyC) than observed in the present Universe. Any explanation invoked to explain LyC escape must agree with this dramatic cosmic evolution. Galaxy mergers are often suggested as such a regulating mechanism. They occur an order or magnitude more frequently at $z \ge 3$ than in the local Universe, and they can trigger LyC escape either by inducing strong nuclear starbursts, or by tidally displacing the neutral ISM from the bulk of the stars. In the local Universe, LyC escape has been found to correlate with a range of physical and observable properties closely associated with strong star formation. For this reason, interest in mergers as drivers of LyC escape have been mainly focused on their capacity to induce strong star formation. However, at $z \ge 2$, these correlations are weaker, and we observe a much more diverse Lyman Continuum Emitter (LCE) population. This suggests that processes external to the LCE galaxies are more important for facilitating the escape at higher redshifts, which makes tidal displacement an interesting explanatory model; however, this has only been conclusively observed once before. In this letter, we present archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU and HST UVIS and IR imaging observations of the z = 3 Lyman-Continuum emitter LACES104037. We find that its Lyman-Continuum escape originates in a tidal bridge in the direction towards an interacting companion galaxy first identified in this work. LyC escape from tidal stripping or in-situ formed stars in tidal features could help explain both the higher cosmic LyC escape fraction and the greater diversity of LCE galaxy properties at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Black Hole Shadows-II: Constraining Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter using the photon rings of M87 and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution of photon rings of Sgr~A$^*$ and M87 is the next milestone of upcoming EHT-like interferometries. We extend the formalism developed in our previous work~\cite{Verma:2023hes} to constrain primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter using microlensing-induced distortions of black hole shadows. Building upon the theoretical framework for microlensing of photon rings, we apply this methodology to both Sgr A* and M87, considering multiple PBH populations: (i) PBH dark matter spikes around central supermassive black holes, (ii) NFW halo contributions in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, and (iii) foreground Milky Way PBH dark matter affecting M87* observations. The microlensing signal manifests as a time-dependent asymmetry and deformation of the photon ring, providing the most sensitive observable for lensing effects. We assess the detectability of these signatures with future EHT-like interferometers. Our analysis reveals that M87* provides the strongest constraints on PBH dark matter. We show that the absence of photon-ring asymmetries in observations with angular resolution of order $0.1\,\mu{\rm as}$ can constrain PBHs in the mass range $10^{-5}\,M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, with maximal sensitivity near $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{3}\,M_\odot$, for PBH dark matter fractions as small as $f_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>How Mergers and Flybys Shape Azimuthal Age Patterns in Spiral Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral structures are one of the most common features in galaxies, yet their origins and evolution remain debated. Stellar age distributions offer crucial insights into galaxy evolution and star formation, though environmental effects can obscure the intrinsic age patterns. Using the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we investigate the azimuthal age distribution of young stars (&lt;2 Gyr) in a sample of five Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies over the past 5 Gyr. We quantify the age gradients across spiral arms using the mean age offset (${\Delta}{\tau}$) and the non-overlap fraction ($f_{non-overlap}$). We further analyse the impact of mergers and fly-by events on the age gradients. Our results show that Auriga spiral galaxies generally feature younger stars in their leading edges compared to the trailing edges, with a typical ${\Delta}{\tau}$ between 30 and 80 Myr. However, gas-rich interactions can disrupt this age offset, resulting in similar age distributions on each side of the spiral arms. In three snapshots, we observe similar mean ages on both sides of spiral arms but differing age distribution broadness, coinciding with satellite interactions crossing the host galaxy's disc plane. Our simulation data suggest that the typical azimuthal age variation recovers within ~600 Myr after galaxy interactions. This work highlights the transient role of environmental interactions in shaping spiral arm age patterns.</description>

      <title>The impact of selection criteria on the properties of green valley galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The bi-modality in the distribution of galaxies usually obtained from colour-colour or colour-stellar mass diagrams has been studied to show the difference between the galaxies in the blue cloud and in the red sequence and to define the green valley region. As a transition region, the green valley galaxies can give clues about morphological transformation of galaxies from late- to early-types, and therefore the selection of green valley is of fundamental importance. Aims: In this work, for the first time, we evaluate the selection effects of the most used green valley selection criteria. The aim is to understand how these criteria affect the identification of green valley galaxies, their properties, and their impact on galaxy evolution studies. Methods: Using the SDSS optical and GALEX ultraviolet data at redshift z &lt; 0.1, we selected the eight most commonly used criteria based on colours, specific star formation rate, and star formation rate vs. stellar mass. We then studied the properties of the green valley galaxies (their stellar mass, star formation rate, specific star formation rate, intrinsic brightness, morphological and
  pectroscopic types) for each selection criterion. Results: We found that when using different criteria, we select different types of galaxies. UV-optical colour-based criteria tend to select more massive galaxies, with lower star formation rates, with higher fractions of composite and elliptical galaxies, than when using pure optical colours. Our results also show that the colour-based criteria are the most sensitive to galaxy properties, rapidly changing the selection of green valley galaxies. Conclusions: Whenever possible, we suggest avoiding the green valley colour-based selection and using other methods or a combination of several, such as the star formation rate vs. stellar mass or specific star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning vs. SED-Fitting: A Comparative Analysis of Accuracy in Stellar Mass Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting methods for stellar mass estimation face persistent challenges including systematic biases and computational constraints. We present a controlled comparison of machine learning (ML) and SED-fitting methods, assessing their accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Using a sample of COSMOS-like galaxies from the Horizon-AGN simulation as a benchmark with known true masses, we evaluate the Parametric t-SNE (Pt-SNE) algorithm -- trained on noise-injected BC03 models -- against the established SED-fitting code LePhare. Our results demonstrate that Pt-SNE achieves superior accuracy, with a root-mean-square error (sigma_F) of 0.169 dex compared to LePhare's 0.306 dex. Crucially, Pt-SNE exhibits significantly lower bias (0.029 dex) compared to LePhare (0.286 dex). Pt-SNE also shows greater robustness across all stellar mass ranges, particularly for low-mass galaxies (10^9 to 10^10 solar masses), where it reduces errors by 47-53 %. Even when restricted to only six optical bands, Pt-SNE outperforms LePhare using all 26 available photometric bands, underscoring its superior informational efficiency. Computationally, Pt-SNE processes large datasets approximately 3.2 x 10^3 times faster than LePhare. These findings highlight the fundamental advantages of ML methods for stellar mass estimation, demonstrating their potential to deliver more accurate, stable, and scalable measurements for large-scale galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength study of an early galaxy group merger in COSMOS revealed by two tailed radio galaxies at z = 0.35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two tailed radio galaxies in the COSMOS field, associated with a massive, dynamically unrelaxed galaxy group detected in X-rays at z = 0.349. One of them is a wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy, supporting the role of WATs as tracers of dynamically young groups and clusters. Our multiwavelength analysis combines VLA radio data, HST-ACS imaging, COSMOS2020 photometric redshifts, COSMOS2015 photometry, the newest compilation of spectroscopic redshifts in COSMOS, and X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton. We used these data to study the tailed radio galaxies, their host galaxies, and the group environment. Both radio galaxies are hosted by massive ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.88\pm0.03$ and $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=11.49\pm0.06$), red, elliptical galaxies with extended stellar halos, as revealed by a color, magnitude, and stellar mass analysis combined with GALFIT modeling and surface-brightness profiles. One corresponds to the brightest group galaxy (BGG), while the other is the second-brightest. A diffuse intragroup medium (IGM) is characterized by its irregular shape and the analysis of the X-ray spectra of the group core reveals high temperature ($T_X=2.4\pm0.6\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{keV}$) and an electron density of $(8.2\pm0.3)\times 10^{-4}\hspace{0.1cm}\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. A galaxy overdensity associated with the group was detected via Voronoi tessellation, using COSMOS2020 CLASSIC photometric redshifts, displaying an irregular morphology, along with evidence of substructure. Assuming the jet bending results from interaction with the IGM, we find a high relative velocity between the BGG and the IGM ($v_{\mathrm{BGG/IGM}} \gtrsim 540$ km/s), primarily due to bulk gas motion. Our findings indicate a dynamically young system in the early stages of assembly via group-group merging.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the near infrared Calcium triplet as metallicity indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-infrared Calcium II Triplet (CaT), around 850nm, is a key metallicity indicator for red giant stars. We present a revised [Fe/H] calibration as a function of CaT line strengths and four luminosity indicators, including the $Gaia$ $G$-band, together with the classical $V$, $I$, and $K_s$ bandpasses. For this purpose, we used a sample of 366 red giant stars belonging to 25 globular and open clusters, complemented by 52 extremely metal-poor field giant stars. The CaT line strengths are determined by fitting Gaussian-Lorentzian combination profiles using the Python lmfit package, which utilises the algorithms implemented therein. The derived calibration is valid for a wide metallicity range, $-4$\,dex$ \lesssim \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \lesssim +0.15$, and for ages older than $\sim$200 Myr. In addition, we performed a detailed assessment of how factors such as spectral resolution, spectral quality (expressed through the signal-to-noise ratio), and the algorithms used to constrain the line profiles affect the measured line strengths and the resulting metallicities.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model and numerical method for multispecies radiation hydrodynamic system with multiscale nonequilibrium transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical framework for simulating radiation-plasma systems. The radiative transfer process spans multiple flow regimes due to varying fluid opacity across different regions, necessitating a robust numerical approach. We employ the multiscale unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), which accurately captures photon transport phenomena from free streaming to diffusive wave propagation. The UGKS is also applied to the fluid model to address the significant mass disparity between electrons and ions, and their associated transport characteristics in both equilibrium continuum and non-equilibrium rarefied regimes. Our model explicitly incorporates momentum and energy exchanges between radiation and fluid fields in the coupled system, enabling detailed analysis of the complex interactions between electromagnetic and hydrodynamic phenomena. The developed algorithm successfully reproduces both optically thin and optically thick radiation limits while capturing the complex multiscale nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled system. This unified treatment eliminates the need for separate numerical schemes in different regimes, providing a consistent and computationally effcient approach for the entire domain. The effectiveness and versatility of this approach are demonstrated through extensive numerical validation across a wide range of physical parameters and flow conditions.</description>

      <title>A novel sub-grid model for super-Eddington accretion of spinning black holes in galaxy-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion has been proposed to explain the existence of black holes (BHs) with masses exceeding a billion solar masses within the first billion years after the Big Bang. We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $\alpha$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars.</description>

Abstract: We present the first band-2 (120--250\,MHz) uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell\,1644 (\(z = 0.0471\)), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of the northern (A1644N1) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N1 exhibits a synchrotron power law spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron self-absorption. Our X-ray analysis confirms the presence of a cold front east of the A1644S subcluster core. The temperature map further reveals a previously unreported asymmetry, with a hot intracluster medium (ICM) region to the east of A1644S and cooler gas to the west, likely representing residual signatures of earlier merger activity. Together, these features indicate that Abell 1644 preserves clear imprints of its merger history through long-lived sloshing motions, while the absence of diffuse radio emission suggests that the past merger was relatively minor not injecting enough turbulence for large scale reacceleration or the cluster is approaching a late stage of ICM relaxation.</description>

      <title>Very Massive Stars and High N/O: A Tale of the Nitrogen-enriched Super Star Cluster in the Sunburst Arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lensed Sunburst Arc ($z = 2.369$) hosts a young ($\sim2$--$4\,\rm Myr$), massive ($M_\star \sim 10^7\,M_\odot$), compact ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 8\,\rm pc$) Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaking super star cluster, which powers a compact ($&lt; 10\,\rm pc$), high-pressure nebula at sub-solar metallicity $\sim0.2\,Z_\odot$ and with an anomalously elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio $\log({\rm N/O}) \sim -0.2$. We present semi-analytic models and 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with radiative feedback in an attempt to reproduce this system. The results indicate that the progenitor giant molecular cloud (GMC) may have $M_{\rm cloud} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $R_{\rm cloud} \sim 70\,\rm pc$, corresponding to a surface density $\sim10^3$--$10^4\,M_\odot\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$. Incorporating feedback from individual Very Massive Stars (VMSs; $\ge 100\,M_\odot$) sampled from the Kroupa initial mass function, we find that their winds rapidly enrich $\sim 10^4\,M_\odot$ of nearby gas with nitrogen ($\sim 1\,$dex) and helium ($\sim 0.1$--$0.2\,$dex). In the first $1$--$3\,$Myr, some cold gas falls to the system center where a central cluster builds up from sub-cluster mergers. There, the gas is photoionized, pressurized, and chemically enriched by the newly formed VMSs, before being radiatively expelled in the next $\sim1\,\rm Myr$. We find that both VMS feedback and a high-surface-density progenitor GMC are necessary to reproduce the observed nebular properties, such as high N/O, high pressure, and stellar proximity. Low metallicity ($Z \le 0.004$) may be essential to avoid overproduction of carbon from WC stars. Such enrichment processes localized to compact starburst events may have caused strong nitrogen emission from dense ionized gas as observed in high-redshift galaxies such as GN-z11 and GS_3073.</description>

      <title>Tracing Quenching in Nearby Galaxies Through Inner Surface Mass Density and Cold Gas Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inner stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc, Sigma1, has emerged as a suitable proxy for bulge growth and galaxy quenching. However, the dependence of cold gas content on Sigma1 has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we examine the relationship between Sigma1, as well as the mass-relative parameter delSigma1, and the atomic (fHI) and molecular (fH2) cold gas fractions in massive, nearby galaxies. We utilize a sample of 341 galaxies with HI data and 201 galaxies with H2 data from the xGASS and xCOLDGASS surveys, spanning 0.02 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.05 and a stellar mass range of 10^10 &lt;= M_*/M_odot &lt;= 10^11.5. While we observe that a decline in both fHI and fH2 is associated with increasing Sigma1, we find that fH2 shows a sharper decline above a threshold value of delSigma1 = 0. In addition, the fraction of galaxies with AGN activity (Seyferts and LINERs) increases with delSigma1, with the greatest increase occurring between 0 &lt;= delSigma1 &lt;= 0.2 dex. We propose an evolutionary track in the plane of fH2-delSigma1, whereby molecular gas depletion at fixed mass coincides with a rise in AGN activity. Our results suggest that central bulge growth is more tightly coupled to the depletion of molecular gas rather than atomic gas, with AGN feedback possibly contributing to this process. Our work highlights the utility of Sigma1 and delSigma1 as tracers of quenching in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Deuterium fractionation and CO depletion in Barnard 5</title>

Abstract: Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Linear Analyses of Thermal Instability in Stratified Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal instability in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) can be responsible for the existence of cold clouds (e.g., high-velocity clouds) embedded in a hot diffuse medium (e.g., X-ray emitting gas). While many previous studies have analyzed thermal instability in uniform medium, the instability mechanism in gravitationally stratified medium like CGM has not been fully analyzed. This study investigates how gravity affects the behavior of thermal instability through linear perturbation analyses.We find that in stratified medium, thermal instability can drive over-stable modes, a behavior distinctly different from the monotonic growth of thermal instability in a uniformmedium. Furthermore, we find that the combination of buoyancy and thermal instability drives other two unstable modes. Applying our results to a simplified model of the CGM, we estimate the gas accretion rate from the CGM to the Galactic disk and the typical size of high-velocity cloud driven by thermal instability to be a few solar masses per year. This gas accretion rate is comparable to the observed star formation rate, and hence, the mass in the Galactic disk can be maintained. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the formation of multi-phase gas, particularly in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Full-sky Models of Galactic Microwave Emission and Polarization at Sub-arcminute Scales for the Python Sky Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarized foreground emission from the Galaxy is one of the biggest challenges facing current and upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments. We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints, that employ the ``polarization fraction tensor'' framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way, and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at sub-arcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model (PySM) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.</description>

      <title>200,000+ Deep Learning-inferred Periods of Stellar Variability from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions; however, these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1 and 30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giant stars that correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry to recover periodicity. We conclude that the findings of our work are very promising for the potential recovery of hundreds of thousands of stellar rotation periods in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescopes Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey.</description>

      <title>3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</description>

      <title>Emergence of streamers in simulations of late infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fallback of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.</description>
