      <title>Quiver varieties and root multiplicities in rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous work in rank two, we use quiver varieties to give a combinatorial upper bound on dimensions of certain imaginary root spaces for rank 3 symmetric Kac-Moody algebras. We describe an explicit method for extracting combinatorics when the Dynkin diagram is bipartite (i.e. two of the nodes are not connected). As in rank two we believe these bounds are quite tight and we give computational evidence to this effect, although there is more error in rank 3 than in rank 2.</description>

      <title>Branching laws for Stein's complementary series and Speh representations of $\operatorname{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the explicit direct integral decomposition of Stein's complementary series representations and Speh representations of $\operatorname{GL}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ when restricted to the subgroup $\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$. The decomposition is a direct integral of unitarily induced representations from a maximal parabolic subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ with Levi factor $\operatorname{GL}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})\times\operatorname{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})$, where the induction data consists of a complementary series or Speh representation of the factor $\operatorname{GL}(2n-2, \mathbb{R})$ with the same parameter as the one of $\operatorname{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ and a character of $\operatorname{GL}(1, \mathbb{R})$. These results are in line with the theory of adduced representations.
  The main tools in the proof are two families of symmetry breaking operators between degenerate series representations of $\operatorname{GL}(2n, \mathbb{R})$ and $\operatorname{GL}(2n-1, \mathbb{R})$ whose meromorphic properties are studied in great detail.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Computing Invariant Spaces via Global Cluster Analysis and Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Singer algebraic transfer is a fundamental homomorphism in algebraic topology, providing a bridge between the homology of classifying spaces and the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$, which forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence. The domain of its dual is isomorphic to the space of $GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$-invariants in the quotient of the polynomial algebra, $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ is regarded as a module over $\mathcal{A}$. A direct computation of this invariant space and its dual (i.e., the domain of the Singer transfer) remains a challenging problem.
  In this paper, we construct a new algorithm to compute $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, which differs from the method presented in our recent work [15]. We refer to this new approach as the Global Cluster Analysis algorithm. It builds a \emph{weight interaction graph} to identify clusters of interacting weight spaces that form closed $\Sigma_k$-submodules (where $\Sigma_k \subset GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$). By performing invariance analysis on these larger clusters, our algorithm enables a complete and accurate computation of the global $\Sigma_k$-invariants, which are then used to determine the final $GL_k(\mathbb F_2)$-invariants.
  We also introduce an algorithm to directly compute the domain of the Singer transfer for ranks $k \leq 3$ in certain generic degrees, based entirely on Boardman's modular representation theory framework [2].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological components of the surface group representations into $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. Utilizing the signature formula established in [10], we determine the number of connected components of the representation spaces with boundary elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic holonomies.</description>

      <title>Liftable braids and the coloured braid groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When $\pi:\widetilde{\Sigma}\rightarrow D^2$ is a cover of the disc branched over $n$ marked points, the braid group $B_n$ acts on the disc by homeomorphisms fixing the marked points setwise. A braid $\beta$ \textit{lifts} if there is a homeomorphism $\widetilde{\beta}\in \textit{Mod}(\widetilde{\Sigma})$ such that $\beta\circ \pi=\pi\circ \widetilde{\beta}$. For arbitrary covers, the \textit{lifting homomorphism} taking $\beta$ to $\widetilde{\beta}$ is only defined on a proper subgroup of the braid group. This paper extends the lifting homomorphism to a map from a coloured braid groupoid to a mapping class groupoid for all simple covers of the disc. We characterise the lift of every coloured braid, recovering the classical lifting homomorphism on the liftable braid group.</description>

      <title>Shuffle Products, Degenerate Affine Hecke Algebras, and Quantum Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit an identification of the quantum Toda lattice for $\mathrm{GL}_N$ and the truncated shifted Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, as well as related constructions, from a purely algebraic point of view, bypassing the topological medium of the homology of the affine Grassmannian. For instance, we interpret the Gerasimov-Kharchev-Lebedev-Oblezin homomorphism into the algebra of difference operators via a finite analog of the Miura transform. This algebraic identification is deduced by relating degenerate affine Hecke algebras to the simplest example of a rational Feigin-Odesskii shuffle product. As a bonus, we obtain a presentation of the latter via a mirabolic version of the Kostant-Whittaker reduction.</description>

      <title>Counts and end-curves in two-parameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory.</description>

      <title>Mackey's obstruction map for discrete graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: G.W. Mackey's celebrated obstruction theory for projective representations of locally compact groups was remarkably generalized by J. M. G. Fell and R. S. Doran to the wide area of saturated Banach *-algebraic bundles.
  Analogous obstruction is suggested here for discrete group graded algebras which are not necessarily saturated, i.e. strongly graded in the discrete context. The obstruction is a map assigning a certain second cohomology class to every equivariance class of absolutely simple graded modules.
  The set of equivariance classes of such modules is equipped with an appropriate multiplication, namely a graded product, such that the obstruction map is a homomorphism of abelian monoids. Graded products, essentially arising as pull-backs of bundles, admit many nice properties, including a way to twist graded algebras and their graded modules.
  The obstruction class turns out to determine the fine part that appears in the Bahturin-Zaicev-Sehgal decomposition, i.e. the graded Artin-Wedderburn theorem for graded simple algebras which are graded Artinian, in case where the base algebras (i.e. the unit fiber algebras) are finite-dimensional over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ were briefly called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association schemes in [9]. In this paper, the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are studied. The centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum group origins of edge states in double-scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) is known to have an underlying quantum group theoretical description. We precisely pinpoint the quantum group structure, improving upon earlier work in the literature. This allows us to utilize this framework for bulk gravitational applications. We explain bulk discretization in DSSYK from the underlying irreducibility of the representations. We derive trumpet and brane amplitudes using character insertions of the quantum group, simplifying earlier calculations. Most importantly, we factorize the bulk Hilbert space dual to DSSYK in the quantum group description using a complete set of edge degrees of freedom living at a bulk entangling surface. An analogous treatment for $\mathcal{N}=1$ DSSYK is provided in the same quantum group theoretical framework.</description>
