      <title>Models for Spatially Resolved Conductivity of Rectangular Interconnects with Integrated Effect of Surface And Grain Boundary Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12162v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface scattering and grain boundary scattering are two prominent mechanisms dictating the conductivity of interconnects and are traditionally modeled using the Fuchs-Sondheimer (FS) and Mayadas-Shatzkes (MS) theories, respectively. In addition to these approaches, modern interconnect structures need to capture the space-dependence of conductivity, for which a spatially resolved FS (SRFS) model was previously proposed to account for surface scattering based on Boltzmann transport equations (BTE). In this paper, we build upon the SRFS model to integrate grain-boundary scattering leading to a physics-based SRFS-MS model for the conductivity of rectangular interconnects. The effect of surface and grain scattering in our model is not merely added (as in several previous works) but is appropriately integrated following the original MS theory. Hence, the SRFS-MS model accounts for the interplay between surface scattering and grain boundary scattering in dictating the spatial dependence of conductivity. We also incorporate temperature (T) dependence into the SRFS-MS model. Further, we propose a circuit compatible conductivity model (SRFS-MS-C3), which captures the space-dependence and integration of surface and grain boundary scattering utilizing an analytical function and a few (three or four) invocations of the physical SRFS-MS model. We validate the SRFS-MS-C3 model across a wide range of physical parameters, demonstrating excellent agreement with the physical SRFS-MS model, with an error margin of less than 0.7%. The proposed SRFS-MS and SRFS-MS-C3 models explicitly relate the spatially resolved conductivity to physical parameters such as electron mean free path ($\lambda_0$), specularity of surface scattering (p), grain boundary reflectance coefficient (R), interconnect cross-section geometry and temperature (T).</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological disclination in acoustic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological disclinations, crystallographic defects that break rotation lattice symmetry, have attracted great interest and exhibited wide applications in cavities, waveguides, and lasers. However, topological disclinations have thus far been predominantly restricted to two-dimensional (2D) systems owing to the substantial challenges in constructing such defects in three-dimensional (3D) systems and characterizing their topological features. Here we report the theoretical proposal and experimental demonstration of a 3D topological disclination that exhibits fractional (1/2) charge and zero-dimensional (0D) topological bound states, realized by cutting-and-gluing a 3D acoustic topological crystalline insulator. Using acoustic pump-probe measurements, we directly observe 0D topological disclination states at the disclination core, consistent with the tight-binding model and full-wave simulation results. Our results extend the research frontier of topological disclinations and open a new paradigm for exploring the interplay between momentum-space band topology and the real-space defect topology in 3D and higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Broadband Terahertz Frequency Comb Based on Actively Mode Locked Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency combs characterized by their phase-coherent equidistant spectral modes and precise frequency scales of broadband spectrum, have made them an indispensable part of contemporary physics. A terahertz (THz) frequency comb is a key asset for THz technology applications in spectroscopy, metrology, communications, and sensing. However, the THz frequency comb technologies are comparatively underdeveloped compared to the optical frequency domain, primarily attributed to the deficiency of advanced THz generation components. In this paper, we innovatively demonstrate a compact THz frequency comb source based on a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) through active mode locking technique. By injecting a strong continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal via the bias line into a RTD oscillator integrated within a WR-5 hollow metallic waveguide package, we observe a broadband comb spectrum spanning from 140 to 325 GHz. The mode spacing is directly determined by the frequency of the injected RF signal, providing a wide tuning range of approximately 40 GHz. We also employ the proposed frequency comb source as the local oscillator in a coherent transmitter. In particular, this is the first all-electrical compact THz frequency comb source, and the transmission demonstration paves the way to next-generation communication.</description>

      <title>Programmable metasurfaces for future photonic artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency, latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies. Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware, enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable next-generation photonic AI technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Navigation-Grade and Deployable Optomechanical Accelerometery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and experimentally demonstrate an architecture for achieving navigation-grade, fiber-packaged optomechanical accelerometers that can operate with a large dynamic range, over a wide temperature range, and without sophisticated laser sources. Our accelerometer architecture is based on a novel set of design principles that take advantage of the strengths of optomechanical accelerometry while eliminating many of its historical weaknesses. Displacement readout is provided by an integrated, differential strain-sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DSMZI) attached to an ultra-rigid, bulk-micromachined proof mass having a 93.4 kHz fundamental resonance frequency (22.5 pm/g displacement). Despite the extreme rigidity, the high displacement sensitivity provides an insertion loss limited 4.2 $\mu g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ acceleration resolution, with a straight-forward path to achieving 330 $n g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by improving the fiber-to-chip coupling. Further, we show that the combination of high rigidity and intrinsic differential optical readout makes the device insensitive to the common causes of bias instability, and we measure a bias instability of 6.3 $\mu g$ at 243 seconds. The DSMZI provides a 17 nm optical bandwidth and a temperature operating range of greater than 20 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, both orders of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations of optomechanical accelerometers. The high rigidity and large optical bandwidth yield an expected dynamic range of 165.4 dB. The combination of high acceleration resolution, high dynamic range, low bias instability, and intrinsic insensitivity to wavelength, temperature, and package stresses makes our device well suited for deployment in realistic environments demanded by real-world applications and demonstrates a path for optomechanical accelerometers to ultimately exceed the performance of all other chip-based accelerometers.</description>

      <title>Implementation of ultra-broadband optical null media via space-folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical null medium (ONM) has garnered significant attention in electromagnetic wave manipulation. However, existing ONM implementations suffer from either narrow operational bandwidths or low efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an ultra-broadband ONM design that simultaneously addresses both challenges - achieving broad bandwidth while preserving perfect impedance matching with air for near-unity transmittance. The proposed space-folding ONM is realized by introducing precisely engineered folds into a metal channel array, creating an effective dispersion-free medium that enables independent phase control in each channel. The design incorporates optimized boundary layers implemented through gradually tapered folding structures, achieving perfect impedance matching with the surrounding medium. Beam bending effect and broadband beam focusing effect are experimentally verified using the proposed space-folding ONM. Due to its simple material requirements, broadband characteristics, and high transmittance, the proposed space-folding ONM shows potential for applications in electromagnetic camouflage, beam steering devices and ultra-compact microwave components.</description>

      <title>Thermal and thermoelectric transport in monolayer h-NbN: Roles of four-phonon scattering and tensile strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the thermal and thermoelectric potential of 2D materials, we explore the h-NbN monolayer, which lacks mirror symmetry and features a large acoustic-optical phonon gap and quadratic flexural mode. First-principles calculations and the Boltzmann transport formalism reveal a complex interplay of multi-phonon scattering processes, where flexural phonons and four-phonon interactions play a significant role in heat transport, primarily dominated by acoustic phonons. Notably, the four-phonon interactions are predominantly confined to acoustic phonons. Tensile strain preserves the underlying scattering mechanisms while reducing anharmonicity, consequently, the scattering rates, enhancing thermal conduction. Simultaneously, competing modifications in thermal and electrical transport shape the strain-dependent thermoelectric response, achieving a figure of merit approaching 1 at elevated temperatures, a testament to its thermoelectric promise. Our findings underscore the critical role of microscopic transport modeling in accurately capturing thermal and thermoelectric properties, paving the way for advanced applications of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Field Reconstruction in Tubes via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to inverse problems in acoustic tube analysis, focusing on reconstructing acoustic fields from noisy and limited observation data. Specifically, we address scenarios where the radiation model is unknown, and pressure data is only available at the tube's radiation end. A PINNs framework is proposed to reconstruct the acoustic field, along with the PINN Fine-Tuning Method (PINN-FTM) and a traditional optimization method (TOM) for predicting radiation model coefficients. The results demonstrate that PINNs can effectively reconstruct the tube's acoustic field under noisy conditions, even with unknown radiation parameters. PINN-FTM outperforms TOM by delivering balanced and reliable predictions and exhibiting robust noise-tolerance capabilities.</description>

      <title>Josephson Junctions in the Age of Quantum Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique combination of energy conservation and nonlinear behavior exhibited by Josephson junctions has driven transformative advances in modern quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. These superconducting devices underpin essential developments across quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication and open pathways to innovative applications in nonreciprocal electronics. These developments are enabled by recent breakthroughs in nanofabrication and characterization methodologies, substantially enhancing device performance and scalability. The resulting innovations reshape our understanding of quantum systems and enable practical applications. This perspective explores the foundational role of Josephson junctions research in propelling quantum technologies forward. We underscore the critical importance of synergistic progress in material science, device characterization, and nanofabrication to catalyze the next wave of breakthroughs and accelerate the transition from fundamental discoveries to industrial-scale quantum utilities. Drawing parallels with the transformative impact of transistor-based integrated circuits during the Information Age, we envision Josephson junction-based circuits as central to driving a similar revolution in the emerging Quantum Age.</description>

Abstract: We present the first experimental prototype of a reflective beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), i.e., a RIS with reconfigurable inter-element connections. Our BD-RIS consists of an antenna array whose ports are terminated by a tunable load network. The latter can terminate each antenna port with three distinct individual loads or connect it to an adjacent antenna port. Extensive performance evaluations in a rich-scattering environment validate that inter-element connections are beneficial. Moreover, we observe that our tunable load network's mentioned hardware constraints significantly influence, first, the achievable performance, second, the benefits of having inter-element connections, and, third, the importance of mutual-coupling awareness during optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This publication presents an investigation of the performance of different analytical electron ptychography methods for low-dose imaging. In particular, benchmarking is performed for two model-objects, monolayer MoS$_2$ and apoferritin, by means of multislice simulations. Specific attention is given to cases where the individual diffraction patterns remain sparse. After a first rigorous introduction to the theoretical foundations of the methods, an implementation based on the scan-frequency partitioning of calculation steps is described, permitting a significant reduction of memory needs and high sampling flexibility. By analyzing the role of contrast transfer and illumination conditions, this work provides insights into the trade-off between resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and probe focus, as is necessary for the optimization of practical experiments. Furthermore, important differences between the different methods are demonstrated. Overall, the results obtained for the two model-objects demonstrate that analytical ptychography is an attractive option for the low-dose imaging of beam-sensitive materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between light and vapors in the presence of magnetic fields is fundamental to many quantum technologies and applications. Recently, the ability to geometrically confine atoms into periodic structures has enabled the creation of chip-scale, micromachined hybrid atomic-diffractive optical elements. However, applying magnetic fields to such structures remains largely unexplored, offering potential for both fundamental and applied insights. Here, we present measurements of an atomic-diffractive optical element subject to magnetic fields. In contrast to the well-known polarization rotation in a Faraday medium, these diffractive atomic elements exhibit additional, rapidly oscillating rotation terms, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, we find that the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields leads to a reduction in fringe visibility, which can be leveraged for gradiometric applications. Together, these effects establish a chip-scale platform where diffraction and quantum sensing are inseparably co-engineered, unveiling previously inaccessible regimes of atom-photon-magnetic interaction. By probing the magneto-optic response of periodically confined vapors, our results lay the groundwork for integrated smart-cell magnetometers and open new avenues for flat-optics-enabled quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnonics is a promising platform for integrated radio frequency (rf) devices, leveraging its inherent non-reciprocity and reconfigurability. However, the efficiency of spin-wave transducers driven by rf-currents remains a major challenge. In this study, we systematically investigate a spin-wave transducer composed of micron-sized rf antennas on yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films of different thickness - an ideal testbed for integrated magnonic devices. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy and numerical simulations, we analyze spin-wave transmission, identifying key loss mechanisms and improving device efficiency by reducing ohmic resistance. The resulting improvements enable the reduction of insertion loss to below $\SI{10}{dB}$ in microscaled spin-wave transducers. At the same time large non-reciprocity can be exploited to achieve significant isolation on the microscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate resonance of first-order vector vortex beams (VVB) with a triangular optical cavity. We also show that, due to their symmetry properties, the VVBs commonly known as radial and azimuthal beams do not resonate at the same cavity length, which could be explored to use the triangular resonator as a mode sorter. In addition, an intracavity Pancharatnam phase shifter (PPS) is implemented in order to compensate for any birefringent phase that the cavity mirrors may introduce.</description>

      <title>DAOs of Collective Intelligence? Unraveling the Complexity of Blockchain Governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechanisms to refine DAO design and construction, a conceptual framework for assessing a DAO's viability is created. This contribution lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science, digital democracy and DAOs.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of vortex and pseudovortex beams with a triangular optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triangular optical cavity can be used to distinguish between two beams with the same intensity profile but different wavefronts. This is what we show in this paper, both theoretically and experimentally, in the case of beams with a doughnut-like intensity profile: one of them having a helical wavefront (vortex beam with orbital angular momentum) and the other with no orbital angular momentum at all (which we call pseudovortex beam). We write the mode decomposition of such beams in the Hermite-Gaussian basis and in the Laguerre-Gauss basis, respectively, and study how they interact with a triangular cavity in terms of their resonance peaks. The experimental results corroborate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating that each beam exhibits a distinct resonance pattern. This suggests that such a cavity can be used to identify beams carrying orbital angular momentum, effectively distinguishing them from pseudovortices. Moreover, we propose an experiment where three cavities may be used to filter out the pseudovortex from a superposition of vortex and pseudovortex.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Sb$_2$S$_3$ Optical Phase Shifter Enabled by Optimizing Sputtering Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By quantitatively evaluating the atomic concentrations of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ films with different sputtering powers and Ar flows, we reveal that a sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ film becomes close to the stoichiometric composition as the sputtering power and Ar flow decrease. We characterize the optical properties of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and show that the lower sputtering power leads to a better figure of merit of Sb$_2$S$_3$ as an optical phase shifter in the near infrared (NIR) range. Based on these results, we achieve a loss per phase shift of 0.33 dB/$\pi$ at a wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m, one of the lowest losses among Sb$_2$S$_3$ phase shifters in the NIR range.</description>
