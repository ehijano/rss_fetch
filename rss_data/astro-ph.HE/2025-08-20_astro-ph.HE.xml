      <title>The New Status Qvo? SN 2021qvo is Another 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernova with a Rising Light-Curve Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with "bumps" in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called "super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. We investigate the validity of the leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model, an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta, by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass of $\log_{10}(M_\mathrm{CSM}/M_{\odot}) = -2.33^{+0.26}_{-0.15}$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Detection of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim5-45$ ($\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectropolarimetric characterization of the Z-source GX 340+0 in the normal branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an X-ray spectropolarimetric characterisation of the Z-source GX 340+0 during the normal branch (NB) and compares it with that obtained for the horizontal branch (HB), using IXPE, NICER and NuSTAR observations. The analysis reveals significant polarisation, with polarisation degrees (PD) of ${\sim}1.4$\% in the NB and ${\sim}3.7$\% in the HB, indicating a notable decrease in polarisation when transitioning from the HB to the NB. The polarisation angles show a consistent trend across the states. Spectropolarimetric analysis favours a dependence of the polarisation on the energy. The Comptonised component shows similar polarisation in both the HB and NB and is higher than the theoretical expectation for a boundary or spreading layer. This suggests a contribution from the wind or the presence of an extended accretion disc corona (ADC) to enhance the polarisation. The results obtained here highlight the importance of using polarimetric data to better understand the accretion mechanisms and the geometry of this class of sources, providing insights into the nature of the accretion flow and the interplay between different spectral components. Overall, the findings advance our understanding of the physical processes governing accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>DIPLODOCUS I: Framework for the evaluation of relativistic transport equations with continuous forcing and discrete particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles. This first paper in a series provides an overview of the analytical framework behind the model, consisting of an integral formulation of the relativistic transport equations (Boltzmann equations) and a discretisation procedure for the particle distribution function (Distribution-In-Plateaux). The latter allows for the evaluation of anisotropic interactions, and generates a conservative numerical scheme for a distribution function's transport through phase space.</description>

      <title>Hyperactive Magnetar Eruptions: Giant Flares, Baryon Ejections, and FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young neutron stars born with magnetic fields $B\gtrsim 10^{16}$ G become hyperactive as the field inside the star evolves through ambipolar diffusion on a timescale $\sim 10^9$ s. We simulate this process numerically and find that it can eject magnetic loops from the star. The internal magnetic field first diffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the surface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption involves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A significant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich crustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear heating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after the giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission, and much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in observed magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce giant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from SGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active, younger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual nebulae. Such hyperactive magnetars are candidates for the central engines of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). We argue that each eruption launches an ultrarelativistic magnetosonic pulse leading the ejecta and steepening into a relativistic shock capable of emitting an FRB.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Initial Lorentz Factor and Jet Opening Angle of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$) and jet half-opening angle ($\theta_{\rm jet}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are critical physical parameters for understanding the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets and the true energy release of GRBs. We compile a sample of 89 GRBs that exhibit an onset bump feature in their early optical or GeV light curves, 42 of which also display a jet break feature, and derive their $\Gamma_{0}$ and $\theta_{\rm jet}$ values. Using this sample, we re-eaxmine the correlations between $\Gamma_{0}$ and the prompt emission parameters (isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$, peak luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$, and peak energy $E_{\rm p}$). Our results confirm the previously reported $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$), $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$, and $E_{\rm iso}$ ($L_{\rm iso}$)$-$$E_{\rm p}$$-$$\Gamma_{0}$ relations for both homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) and wind density profiles (Wind). Notably, we find that the short GRB 090510 complies with the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm iso}$ relation, but significantly deviates from the $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$L_{\rm iso}$ and $\Gamma_{0}$$-$$E_{\rm p,z}$ relations. We systematically investigate the influence of $\theta_{\rm jet}$ on $\Gamma_{0}$ and find a weak dependence. Additionally, we report, for the first time, three new three-parameter correlations, i.e., $E_{\rm iso}$ (or $L_{\rm iso}$, $E_{\rm p,z}$)$-$$\Gamma_{0}$$-$$\theta_{\rm jet}$ correlations. In addition, we further explore the relations between the initial Lorentz factor and the jet-corrected energy. We also find that the jet-corrected correlations remain significant, suggesting that these relations are intrinsic to the physical nature of GRBs. However, the increased dispersion after correction implies that underlying differences persist among individual GRBs.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC 0600-399 in Abell 3376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dissipation Physics on High-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations in Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effects of black hole spin and local dissipation profiles on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) observed in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXB). Our HFQPO power spectra arise from self-consistent calculations that do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions regarding disk geometry. Our models combine radiative transfer and disk vertical structure equations with input motivated by first-principles three-dimensional simulations. We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to spatial distribution of dissipation rates while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin. We discuss the observational implications of our results in context of steep power law (SPL) spectra from BHXBs that are seen together with HFQPOs, and how QPO properties may be indicators of the underlying physical oscillations.</description>

      <title>PHECT: A lightweight computation tool for pulsar halo emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\gamma$-ray pulsar halos, formed by inverse Compton scattering of electrons and positrons propagating in the pulsar-surrounding interstellar medium with background photons, serve as an ideal probe for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation on small scales (typically tens of parsecs). While the associated electron and positron propagation is often modeled using homogeneous and isotropic diffusion, termed here as normal diffusion, the actual transport process is expected to be more complex. This work introduces the Pulsar Halo Emission Computation Tool (PHECT), a lightweight software designed for modeling pulsar halo emission. PHECT incorporates multiple transport models extending beyond normal diffusion, accounting for different possible origins of pulsar halos. Users can conduct necessary computations simply by configuring a YAML file without manual code edits. Furthermore, the tool adopts finite-volume discretizations that remain stable on non-uniform grids and in the presence of discontinuous coefficients. PHECT is ready for the increasingly precise observational data and the rapidly growing sample of pulsar halos.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring precession of accretion flows: relativistic versus classical precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical (Lense-Thirring) precession of the innermost accretion flows has been discussed as a sensitive indicator of the rotational properties of neutron stars (NSs) and their equation of state because it vanishes for a non-rotating star. In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the frequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows. We build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which revealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical precession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric, linear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour of the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS angular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the dependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii within the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low values of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of accreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession frequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between the frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and the NS spin. In our work, we provide a full, general description of precession behaviour, and also examples that assume specific NS and quark star (MIT bag) equation of state. Our calculations are reproducible using the associated Wolfram Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.</description>

Abstract: The physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains uncertain. Although multiwavelength observations offer critical diagnostics and have been widely conducted, only Galactic FRB~20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the nearby bright FRB~20250316A, including the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe (EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). A 13.08-hour FAST follow-up observational campaign suggests that this burst is likely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational campaign totaling $&gt;$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the angular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\prime\prime}$). A subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by $7^{\prime\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux upper limit of $7.6\times 10^{-15}$ $\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB position, corresponding to $\sim 10^{39}$ $\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc distance of the host galaxy NGC~4141. These results set one of the most stringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs and offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that an arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart is essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.</description>

      <title>Compact stars in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: regular and divergent scalar field configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>

      <title>Shadow of a nonlinear electromagnetic generalized Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the formation of GW231123 from the AGN channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent binary black hole (BBH) merger GW231123 consisted of the merger of two intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) which appear to have large spin magnitudes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function (IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS, we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the AGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123 are most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most choices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime.</description>

      <title>X-ray selected broad absorption line quasars in SDSS-V: BALs and non-BALs span the same range of X-ray properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars are often considered X-ray weak relative to their optical/UV luminosity, whether intrinsically (i.e., the coronal emission is fainter) or due to large column densities of absorbing material. The SDSS-V is providing optical spectroscopy for samples of quasar candidates identified by eROSITA as well as Chandra, XMM or Swift, making the resulting datasets ideal for characterising the BAL quasar population within an X-ray selected sample. We use the Balnicity Index (BI) to identify the BAL quasars based on absorption of the CIV $\lambda\,1549$ emission line in the optical spectra, finding 143 BAL quasars in our sample of 2317 X-ray selected quasars within $1.5\le z \le3.5$. This observed BAL fraction of $\approx$ 6 per cent is comparable to that found in optically selected samples. We also identify absorption systems via the Absorption Index (AI) which includes mini-BALs and NALs, finding 954 quasars with AI $&gt;0$. We consider the CIV emission space (equivalent width vs. blueshift) to study the BAL outflows within the context of the radiatively driven accretion disc-wind model. X-ray selection excludes the highest outflow velocities in emission but includes the full range of absorption velocities which we suggest is consistent with the BAL gas being located further from the X-ray corona than the emitting gas. We observe both X-ray weak and X-ray strong BALs (via the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope, $\alpha_\text{ox}$) and detect little evidence for differing column densities between the BAL and non-BAL quasars, suggesting the BALs and non-BALs have the same shielding gas and intrinsic X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Large Gravitational Wave Phase Shifts from Strong 3-body Interactions in Dense Stellar Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves (GWs) can be modulated by the astrophysical environment surrounding the source, which provides a probe for the origin of individual binary black holes (BBHs) using GWs alone. We here study the evolving phase of the GW waveform derived from a large set of simulations of BBH mergers forming in dense stellar clusters through binary-single interactions. We uncover that a well-defined fraction of the assembled eccentric GW sources will have a notable GW phase shift induced by the remaining third object. The magnitude of the GW phase shift often exceeds conservative analytical estimates due to strong 3-body interactions, which occasionally results in GW sources with clearly shifted and perturbed GW waveforms. This opens up promising opportunities for current and future GW detectors, as observing such a phase shift can identify the formation environment of a BBH, as well as help to characterise the local properties of its surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Geminga: A Window of the Role Played by Local Halo in the Cosmic Ray Propagation Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel phenomenon among the recently observed Geminga pulsar halo is the presence of distinct radiation morphology at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected in the 10-500 GeV energy band within a $40\degree\times40\degree$ region. This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-wavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) The slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region. (2) The incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic ray halo to further validate our model.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Luminosity Function and Delay-Time Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts for Multimessenger Gravitational-Wave Detection Rate Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical redshift-luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the Gaussian delay model statistically preferred over the power-law and lognormal delay models based on the Deviance Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $R_{\mathrm{sGRB}}(0)=1.37_{-0.27}^{+0.30}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Incorporating the angular dependence of sGRB jet emission energy, our results show that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.19--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.93--1.35 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.07--0.10 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.51--0.79 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.03 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.15--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Outer Edge of the Infant Type Ia Supernova 2024epr in the Optical and Near Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical-to-near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024epr, including NIR spectra observed within two days of first light. The early-time optical spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca and Si features near rarely-observed velocities at $\sim$0.1$c$, and the NIR spectra show a C I "knee." Despite early-time, high-velocity features, SN 2024epr evolves into a normal SN Ia, albeit with stronger peak-light Ca absorption than other SNe Ia with the same light curve shape. Although we infer a normal decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve rise, SN 2024epr is a Branch "cool" object and has red early-time colors ($g-r\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density enhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, predicted by some models, but thick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve or apparent lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra. No current models (e.g., delayed detonation or thin He shell double detonation) appear to reproduce all observed properties, particularly the unusual early-time colors. Such constraints are only possible for SN 2024epr from the earliest optical and NIR observations, highlighting their importance for constraining SN Ia models. Finally, we identify several literature SNe Ia with intermediate mass elements at $\sim$30\,000 km s$^{-1}$ within days after the explosion that evolve into otherwise normal SNe Ia at peak light, suggesting the early-time spectra of SNe Ia may hide a broad diversity of observational characteristics.</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Particle Mediated Dark Matter and Neutron Star Properties in the QHD Model</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the ALP-mediated dark matter (DM) model on neutron star properties using the Quantum Hadrodynamics model (QHD). Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f &lt; 0.05$ GeV and $m_{\chi} &lt; 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Modelling of Early Peaks in Type Ibc Supernovae with Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a subclass of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the main, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are typically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly attributed to the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain the pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first systematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that incorporates hydrodynamic modelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding within CSM using the multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics code \texttt{STELLA}, exploring a range of SN and CSM properties. By comparing the theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of seven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties. Assuming a wind-like density distribution of CSM, we found CSM masses of $10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \ \Msun$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \times 10^3 \ \Rsun$. While the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained using an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due to a simplified assumption on blackbody temperature used in analytical models. We infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass transfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned \textit{ULTRASAT} high-cadence survey, $\sim 30$ early peaks similar to those in this paper from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.</description>

      <title>Search for the Optical Counterpart of Einstein Probe Discovered Fast X-ray Transients from Lulin Observatory</title>

Abstract: The launch of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission has revolutionized the detection and follow-up observations of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) by providing prompt and timely access to their precise localizations. In the first year of its operation, the EP-mission reports the discovery of 72 high signal-to-noise FXTs. Subjected to the visibility in the sky and weather conditions, we search for the optical counterparts of 42 EP-discovered FXTs from the Lulin Observatory. We successfully detect the optical counterparts of 12 FXTs, and five of those are first discovered by us from the Lulin Observatory. We find that the optical counterparts are generally faint ($r&gt;20$\,mag) and decline rapidly ($&gt;0.5$\,mag per day). We also find that 12 out of 42 FXTs show direct evidence of their association with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) through significant temporal and spatial overlapping. Furthermore, the luminosities and redshifts of FXTs with confirmed optical counterparts in our observations are fully consistent with the faintest end of the GRB population. However, the non-detection of any associated optical counterpart with a significant fraction of FXTs suggests that EP FXTs are likely a subset of so-called `dark FXTs', similar to `dark GRBs'. Additionally, the luminosities of {\bf two FXTs with confirmed redshifts} are also consistent with jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, we find that the optical luminosities of FXTs differ significantly from typical supernova shock breakout or kilonova emissions. Thus, we conclude that a significant fraction of EP-discovered FXTs are associated with events having relativistic jets; either a GRB or a jetted TDE.</description>

      <title>Magnetar field dynamics shaped by chiral anomalies and helicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) -- a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum chiral anomaly -- induces currents along magnetic field lines, facilitating mutual conversion between chiral asymmetry and magnetic helicity. Although the finite electron mass suppresses chiral asymmetry through spin-flip processes, we demonstrate that the CME effectively shapes magnetar field evolution. Magnetic helicity acts as a persistent internal source of chiral asymmetry, which mediates the redistribution of magnetic energy across spatial scales, without requiring an external energy source. Our three-dimensional magneto-thermal simulations of the neutron star crust reveal a novel mechanism that significantly reconfigures the magnetic field inherited at birth, amplifying both toroidal and poloidal large-scale dipolar components (crucial for spin-down) to strengths of &gt;1e14 G within just a century, at the expense of small-scale structures. This astrophysical application of the CME, distinct and complementary to conventional hydrodynamic dynamo models, offers an innovative framework for understanding magnetar field dynamics and provides a transformative solution to the origin of their exceptionally strong, large-scale fields.</description>

      <title>Pair Cascades in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resonant inverse Compton scattering (RICS) of soft thermal photons by relativistic particles on closed magnetic field loops has been proposed to explain the hard emission observed up to, and beyond, 200 keV from magnetars. If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors &gt;= 10^2, the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and photon splitting in the ultra-strong magnetar fields, producing additional spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo simulation and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split photon spectra dominate the RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular, the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40% - 80%, are softer than the RICS spectra and may account for the high polarization of some magnetar spectra observed by IXPE above 3 keV.</description>

      <title>CGM cloud sizes from refractive FRB scattering</title>

Abstract: We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive scattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most conservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make assumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of low-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\rm e} \lesssim 10^{-2}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and, hence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\lesssim 0.1$ pc (about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such densities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\rm e} \gtrsim 0.1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to inhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds would result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\gtrsim 1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected. We argue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a signature of sub-parsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence contributes to the overall scattering. At redshift $z\sim 3$, we estimate $\sim 0.1\%$ of FRBs to intersect massive proto-clusters, which may be the most likely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous $n_{\rm e} \approx 1\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud size, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated by hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>The eROSITA view on the halo mass-temperature relation: From low-mass groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are among the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimate.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.</description>
