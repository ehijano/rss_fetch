      <title>Near-Field Wideband Beamforming for RIS Based on Fresnel Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the challenges of high path loss and easy signal blockage in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communication systems. With the increase of RIS aperture and system bandwidth, the near-field beam split effect emerges, which causes beams at different frequencies to focus on distinct physical locations, leading to a significant gain loss of beamforming. To address this problem, we leverage the property of Fresnel zone that the beam split disappears for RIS elements along a single Fresnel zone and propose beamforming design on the two dimensions of along and across the Fresnel zones. The phase shift of RIS elements along the same Fresnel zone are designed aligned, so that the signal reflected by these element can add up in-phase at the receiver regardless of the frequency. Then the expression of equivalent channel is simplified to the Fourier transform of reflective intensity across Fresnel zones modulated by the designed phase. Based on this relationship, we prove that the uniformly distributed in-band gain with aligned phase along the Fresnel zone leads to the upper bound of achievable rate. Finally, we design phase shifts of RIS to approach this upper bound by adopting the stationary phase method as well as the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed Fresnel zone-based method in mitigating the near-field beam split effect.</description>

      <title>Distributed matrix multiplication with straggler tolerance over very small field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of distributed matrix multiplication with straggler tolerance over finite fields is considered, focusing on field sizes for which previous solutions were not applicable (for instance, the field of two elements). We employ Reed-Muller-type codes for explicitly constructing the desired algorithms and study their parameters by translating the problem into a combinatorial problem involving sums of discrete convex sets. We generalize polynomial codes and matdot codes, discussing the impossibility of the latter being applicable for very small field sizes, while providing optimal solutions for some regimes of parameters in both cases.</description>

      <title>A geometric invariant of linear rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.</description>

      <title>Syndrome-Based Error-Erasure Decoding of Interleaved Linearized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearized Reed--Solomon (LRS) codes are sum-rank-metric codes that generalize both Reed--Solomon and Gabidulin codes. We study vertically and horizontally interleaved LRS (VILRS and HILRS) codes whose codewords consist of a fixed number of stacked or concatenated codewords of a chosen LRS code. Our unified presentation of results for horizontal and vertical interleaving is novel and simplifies the recognition of resembling patterns.
  This paper's main results are syndrome-based decoders for both VILRS and HILRS codes. We first consider an error-only setting and then present more general error-erasure decoders, which can handle full errors, row erasures, and column erasures simultaneously. Here, an erasure means that parts of the row space or the column space of the error are already known before decoding. We incorporate this knowledge directly into Berlekamp--Massey-like key equations and thus decode all error types jointly. The presented error-only and error-erasure decoders have an average complexity in $O(sn^2)$ and $\widetilde{O}(sn^2)$ in most scenarios, where $s$ is the interleaving order and $n$ denotes the length of the component code.
  Errors of sum-rank weight $\tau=t_{\mathcal{F}}+t_{\mathcal{R}}+t_{\mathcal{C}}$ consist of $t_{\mathcal{F}}$ full errors, $t_{\mathcal{R}}$ row erasures, and $t_{\mathcal{C}}$ column erasures. Their successful decoding can be guaranteed for $t_{\mathcal{F}}\leq\tfrac{1}{2}(n-k-t_{\mathcal{R}}-t_{\mathcal{C}})$, where $n$ and $k$ represent the length and the dimension of the component LRS code. Moreover, probabilistic decoding beyond the unique-decoding radius is possible with high probability when $t_{\mathcal{F}}\leq\tfrac{s}{s+1}(n-k-t_{\mathcal{R}}-t_{\mathcal{C}})$ holds for interleaving order $s$. We give an upper bound on the failure probability for probabilistic unique decoding and showcase its tightness via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Aerial Platforms for Downlink Communications in Sparse Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although a significant number satellites are deemed essential for facilitating diverse applications of satellite networks, aerial platforms are emerging as excellent alternatives for enabling reliable communications with fewer satellites. In scenarios with sparse satellite networks, aerial platforms participate in downlink communications, serving effectively as relays and providing comparable or even superior coverage compared to a large number of satellites. This paper explores the role of aerial platforms in assisting downlink communications, emphasizing their potential as an alternative to dense satellite networks. Firstly, we account for the space-time interconnected movement of satellites in orbits by establishing a stochastic geometry framework based on an isotropic satellite Cox point process. Using this model, we evaluate space-and-time performance metrics such as the number of orbits, the number of communicable satellites, and the connectivity probability, primarily assessing the geometric impact of aerial platforms. Subsequently, we analyze signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) coverage probability, end-to-end throughput, and association delay. Through examination of these performance metrics, we explicitly demonstrate how aerial platforms enhance downlink communications by improving various key network performance metrics that would have been achieved only by many satellites, thereby assessing their potential as an excellent alternative to dense satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Reflecting Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been treated as a core technique in improving wireless propagation environments for the next generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes a new coded caching problem, referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple antennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing multi-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited number of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e., degrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using RIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any path between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift coefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each time slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups including transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission antennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the transmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of maximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a grouping algorithm which can find the optimal solution with low complexity, and the corresponding coded caching scheme achieving this DoF.</description>

      <title>Parametric Lattices Are Better Quantizers in Dimensions 13 and 14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New lattice quantizers with lower normalized second moments than previously reported are constructed in 13 and 14 dimensions and conjectured to be optimal. Our construction combines an initial numerical optimization with a subsequent analytical optimization of families of lattices, whose Voronoi regions are constructed exactly. The new lattices are constructed from glued products of previously known lattices, by scaling the component lattices and then optimizing the scale factors. A two-parameter family of lattices in 13 dimensions reveals an intricate landscape of phase changes as the parameters are varied.</description>

      <title>Fractal Conditional Correlation Dimension Infers Complex Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining causal inference has become popular in physical and engineering applications. While the problem has immense challenges, it provides a way to model the complex networks by observing the time series. In this paper, we present the optimal conditional correlation dimensional geometric information flow principle ($oGeoC$) that can reveal direct and indirect causal relations in a network through geometric interpretations. We introduce two algorithms that utilize the $oGeoC$ principle to discover the direct links and then remove indirect links. The algorithms are evaluated using coupled logistic networks. The results indicate that when the number of observations is sufficient, the proposed algorithms are highly accurate in identifying direct causal links and have a low false positive rate.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface: A New Paradigm for Ultra-Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in current 5G communications, ultra-massive MIMO emerges as a seminal technology for fulfilling more stringent requirements of future 6G communications. However, widely-utilized phased arrays relying on active components make the implementation of ultra-massive MIMO in practice increasingly prohibitive from both cost and power consumption perspectives. In contrast, the development of reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) provides a new paradigm to solve the above issue without the need of costly hardware components. By leveraging the holographic principle, the RHS serves as an ultra-thin and lightweight surface antenna integrated with the transceiver, which is a promising alternative to phased arrays for realizing ultra-massive MIMO. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the RHS, especially the RHS-aided communication and sensing. We first describe the basic concepts of RHS, and introduce its working principle and unique practical constraints. Moreover, we show how to utilize the RHS to achieve cost-efficient and high-performance wireless communication and sensing, and introduce the key technologies. In particular, we present the implementation of RHS with a wireless communication prototype, and report the experimental measurement results based on it. Finally, we outline some open challenges and potential future directions in this area.</description>

      <title>Channel Access Strategies for Control-Communication Co-Designed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for communication-control co-design in a wireless networked control system with multiple geographically separated controllers and controlled systems, modeled via a Poisson point process. Each controlled system consists of an actuator, plant, and sensor. Controllers receive state estimates from sensors and design control inputs, which are sent to actuators over a shared wireless channel, causing interference. Our co-design includes control strategies at the controller based on sensor measurements and transmission acknowledgments from the actuators for both rested and restless systems - systems with and without state feedback, respectively. In the restless system, controllability depends on consecutive successful transmissions, while in the rested system, it depends on total successful transmissions. We use both classical and block ALOHA protocols for channel access, optimizing access based on sensor data and acknowledgments. A statistical analysis of control performance is followed by a Thompson sampling-based algorithm to optimize the ALOHA parameter, achieving sub-linear regret. We show how the ALOHA parameter influences control performance and transmission success in both system types.</description>

      <title>Emerging Technologies in Intelligent Metasurfaces: Shaping the Future of Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Spatial-Temporal Channel Statistics from Measurement Data at D Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) (30-300 GHz) and D band (110-170 GHz) frequencies are poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) systems and beyond with increased demand for greater bandwidth and capacity. This paper focuses on deriving a generalized channel impulse response for mmWave communications, considering both outdoor and indoor locations for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The analysis is based on statistical insights obtained from measurements conducted at distinct locations with a center frequency of 142 GHz, examining parameters such as path gain, delay, number of paths (NoP), and angle distributions. Whereas different distributions serve as candidate models for the gain of LOS communications, only specific distributions accurately describe the NLOS gain, LOS and NLOS delay, LOS and NLOS NoP, and LOS and NLOS angular distributions. The channel is modeled based on geometry-based stochastic channel modeling (GBSM) with parameters derived from the statistical analysis. The maximum excess delay is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed model against empirical data.</description>

      <title>Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores systems where source updates require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We focus on a special case where updates require two computational steps.</description>

      <title>Inference Privacy: Properties and Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Ensuring privacy during inference stage is crucial to prevent malicious third parties from reconstructing users' private inputs from outputs of public models. Despite a large body of literature on privacy preserving learning (which ensures privacy of training data), there is no existing systematic framework to ensure the privacy of users' data during inference. Motivated by this problem, we introduce the notion of Inference Privacy (IP), which can allow a user to interact with a model (for instance, a classifier, or an AI-assisted chat-bot) while providing a rigorous privacy guarantee for the users' data at inference. We establish fundamental properties of the IP privacy notion and also contrast it with the notion of Local Differential Privacy (LDP). We then present two types of mechanisms for achieving IP: namely, input perturbations and output perturbations which are customizable by the users and can allow them to navigate the trade-off between utility and privacy. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our framework via experiments and highlight the resulting trade-offs between utility and privacy during inference.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Digital Twins with TLA and Information Leakage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that the digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the physical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between physical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex system is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology to specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes into a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that defines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach includes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled information leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate this approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying synchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to detect unintended misalignments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile communications have been undergoing a generational change every ten years. While 5G network deployments are maturing, significant efforts are being made to standardize 6G, which is expected to be commercially introduced by 2030. This paper provides unique perspectives on the 6G network (radio and core) architecture(s) from the anticipated 6G use cases to meet the necessary performance requirements. To cater for the key 6G use cases, the 6G architecture must integrate different network-level functions in a multiplicity of virtual cloud environments, leveraging the advancements of distributed processing, artificial intelligence, and securely integrating different sub-networks e.g., terrestrial, and non-terrestrial networks into the overall 6G network. This paper characterizes the impact of 6G architectures from a deployment perspective with backwards compatibility in mind.</description>

      <title>Sharing the Path: A Threshold Scheme from Isogenies and Error Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2022, a prominent supersingular isogeny-based cryptographic scheme, namely SIDH, was compromised by a key recovery attack. However, this attack does not undermine the isogeny path problem, which remains central to the security of isogeny-based cryptography. Following the attacks by Castryck and Decru, as well as Maino and Martindale, Robert gave a mature and polynomial-time algorithm that transforms the SIDH key recovery attack into a valuable cryptographic tool. In this paper, we combine this tool with advanced encoding techniques to construct a novel threshold scheme.</description>

      <title>Pilot Contamination Aware Transformer for Downlink Power Control in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based downlink power control in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems offers a promising alternative to conventional iterative optimization algorithms, which are computationally intensive due to online iterative steps. Existing learning-based methods, however, often fail to exploit the intrinsic structure of channel data and neglect pilot allocation information, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in large-scale networks with many users. This paper introduces the pilot contamination-aware power control (PAPC) transformer neural network, a novel approach that integrates pilot allocation data into the network, effectively handling pilot contamination scenarios. PAPC employs the attention mechanism with a custom masking technique to utilize structural information and pilot data. The architecture includes tailored preprocessing and post-processing stages for efficient feature extraction and adherence to power constraints. Trained in an unsupervised learning framework, PAPC is evaluated against the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm, showing comparable spectral efficiency fairness performance while significantly improving computational efficiency. Simulations demonstrate PAPC's superior performance over fully connected networks (FCNs) that lack pilot information, its scalability to large-scale CFmMIMO networks, and its computational efficiency improvement over APG. Additionally, by employing padding techniques, PAPC adapts to the dynamically varying number of users without retraining.</description>

      <title>On the Goppa morphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric foundations of the space of geometric Goppa codes using the Tsfasman-Vladut H-construction. These codes are constructed from level structures, which extend the classical Goppa framework by incorporating invertible sheaves and trivializations. A key contribution is the definition of the Goppa morphism, a map from the moduli space of level structures, denoted $LS_{g,n,d}$, to the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$. This morphism allows problems related to distinguishing attacks and key recovery in the context of geometric Goppa codes to be translated into a geometric language, addressing questions about the equations defining the image of the Goppa morphism and its fibers. Furthermore, we identify the ranges of the degree parameter $d$ that should be avoided to maintain security against distinguishers. Our results, valid over arbitrary base fields, also apply to convolutional Goppa codes.</description>

      <title>Neural Window Decoder for SC-LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural window decoder (NWD) for spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes. The proposed NWD retains the conventional window decoder (WD) process but incorporates trainable neural weights. To train the weights of NWD, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, we restrict the loss function to target variable nodes (VNs) of the window, which prunes the neural network and accordingly enhances training efficiency. Second, we employ the active learning technique with a normalized loss term to prevent the training process from biasing toward specific training regions. Next, we develop a systematic method to derive non-uniform schedules for the NWD based on the training results. We introduce trainable damping factors that reflect the relative importance of check node (CN) updates. By skipping updates with less importance, we can omit $\mathbf{41\%}$ of CN updates without performance degradation compared to the conventional WD. Lastly, we address the error propagation problem inherent in SC-LDPC codes by deploying a complementary weight set, which is activated when an error is detected in the previous window. This adaptive decoding strategy effectively mitigates error propagation without requiring modifications to the code and decoder structures.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Scaling in Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithmic framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines that preserves topological stability under non-uniform scaling transformations. Given a finite metric space \( X \subset \mathbb{R}^n \) with Euclidean distance \( d_X \), we consider scaling transformations defined by scaling factors \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n &gt; 0 \). Specifically, we define a scaling function \( S \) that maps each point \( x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \in X \) to \[ S(x) = (s_1 x_1, s_2 x_2, \ldots, s_n x_n). \] Our main result establishes that the bottleneck distance \( d_B(D, D_S) \) between the persistence diagrams \( D \) of \( X \) and \( D_S \) of \( S(X) \) satisfies: \[ d_B(D, D_S) \leq (s_{\max} - s_{\min}) \cdot \operatorname{diam}(X), \] where \( s_{\min} = \min_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), \( s_{\max} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} s_i \), and \( \operatorname{diam}(X) \) is the diameter of \( X \). Based on this theoretical guarantee, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the scaling variability \( \Delta_s = s_{\max} - s_{\min} \) under the constraint \( d_B(D, D_S) \leq \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon &gt; 0 \) is a user-defined tolerance.
  We develop an algorithmic solution to this problem, ensuring that data augmentation via scaling transformations preserves essential topological features. We further extend our analysis to higher-dimensional homological features, alternative metrics such as the Wasserstein distance, and iterative or probabilistic scaling scenarios. Our contributions provide a rigorous mathematical framework for dataset normalization in data augmentation pipelines, ensuring that essential topological characteristics are maintained despite scaling transformations.</description>

      <title>Fast Mutual Information Computation for Large Binary Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a powerful statistical measure that quantifies shared information between random variables, particularly valuable in high-dimensional data analysis across fields like genomics, natural language processing, and network science. However, computing MI becomes computationally prohibitive for large datasets where it is typically required a pairwise computational approach where each column is compared to others. This work introduces a matrix-based algorithm that accelerates MI computation by leveraging vectorized operations and optimized matrix calculations. By transforming traditional pairwise computational approaches into bulk matrix operations, the proposed method enables efficient MI calculation across all variable pairs. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with computation times reduced up to 50,000 times in the largest dataset using optimized implementations, particularly when utilizing hardware optimized frameworks. The approach promises to expand MI's applicability in data-driven research by overcoming previous computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Reverse-type Data Processing Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum data processing inequality states that two quantum states become harder to distinguish when a noisy channel is applied. On the other hand, a reverse quantum data processing inequality characterizes whether a pair of states remains distinguishable after the application of a noisy channel. In this work, we explore these concepts through contraction and expansion coefficients of quantum channels. We show that many quantum channels do not have a non-zero expansion coefficient, which means that they cannot admit a reverse data-processing inequality. Furthermore, we propose a comparative approach by introducing a relative expansion coefficient, to assess how one channel expands relative entropy compared to another. We show that this relative expansion coefficient is positive for various pairs of quantum channels, including depolarizing, generalized dephasing, and amplitude damping channels, allowing us to establish a reverse-type data processing inequality for several settings. As an application, we construct a class of less noisy quantum channels that are non-degradable. This work contributes new mathematical tools for evaluating quantum information preservation across channels.</description>

      <title>Joint Message Detection and Channel Estimation for Unsourced Random Access in Cell-Free User-Centric Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider unsourced random access (uRA) in a cell-free (CF) user-centric wireless network, where a large number of potential users compete for a random access slot, while only a finite subset is active. The random access users transmit codewords of length $L$ symbols from a shared codebook, which are received by $B$ geographically distributed radio units (RUs) equipped with $M$ antennas each. Our goal is to devise and analyze a \emph{centralized} decoder to detect the transmitted messages (without prior knowledge of the active users) and estimate the corresponding channel state information. A specific challenge lies in the fact that, due to the geographically distributed nature of the CF network, there is no fixed correspondence between codewords and large-scale fading coefficients (LSFCs). This makes current activity detection approaches which make use of this fixed LSFC-codeword association not directly applicable. To overcome this problem, we propose a scheme where the access codebook is partitioned in location-based subcodes, such that users in a particular location make use of the corresponding subcode. The joint message detection and channel estimation is obtained via a novel {\em Approximated Message Passing} (AMP) algorithm for a linear superposition of matrix-valued sources corrupted by noise. The statistical asymmetry in the fading profile and message activity leads to \emph{different statistics} for the matrix sources, which distinguishes the AMP formulation from previous cases. In the regime where the codebook size scales linearly with $L$, while $B$ and $M$ are fixed, we present a rigorous high-dimensional (but finite-sample) analysis of the proposed AMP algorithm. Exploiting this, we then present a precise (and rigorous) large-system analysis of the message missed-detection and false-alarm rates, as well as the channel estimation mean-square error.</description>

      <title>Networked Collaborative Sensing using Multi-domain Measurements: Architectures, Performance Limits and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising 6G technology, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) gains growing interest. ISAC provides integration gain via sharing spectrum, hardware, and software. However, concerns exist regarding its sensing performance when compared to the dedicated radar. To address this issue, the advantages of widely deployed networks should be utilized. This paper proposes networked collaborative sensing (NCS) using multi-domain measurements (MM), including range, Doppler, and two-dimension angles. For the NCS-MM architecture, this paper proposes a novel multi-domain decoupling model and a novel guard band-based protocol. The proposed model simplifies multi-domain derivations and algorithm designs, and the proposed protocol conserves resources and mitigates NCS interference. In terms of performance limits, this paper derives the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of position and velocity estimations in NCS-MM. An accumulated single-dimension channel model is proposed, which is proven to be equivalent to that of the multi-dimension model. The algorithms of both MM estimation and fusion are proposed. An arbitrary-dimension Newtonized orthogonal matched pursuit (AD-NOMP) is proposed to accurately estimate grid-less MM. The degree-of-freedom (DoF) of MM is analyzed, and a novel DoF-based two-stage weighted least squares (TSWLS) is proposed to reduce complexity without DoF loss. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithms approach their performance limits.</description>

      <title>Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and operation at higher frequency bands in wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduce significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. Combined with dual-wideband impacts, these effects fundamentally reshape the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, making existing sparsity-based channel estimation methods inadequate. To address these challenges, this paper revisits the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems, considering dual-wideband effects, spherical wavefront, and SnS properties. By leveraging the spatial-chirp property of near-field array responses, we quantitatively characterize the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, revealing global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. Building on this structured sparsity, we formulate the wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference task and propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model to effectively capture the sparsity characteristics. To enable efficient channel reconstruction, we develop an MMV-based variational message passing (MMV-VMP) algorithm, tailored to the complex factor graph induced by the hierarchical prior. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its convergence and superior performance compared to existing methods, thus establishing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation under complex near-field conditions.</description>

Abstract: Scalable exploration in high-dimensional, complex environments is a significant challenge in sequential decision making, especially when utilizing neural networks. Ensemble sampling, a practical approximation of Thompson sampling, is widely adopted but often suffers performance degradation due to {ensemble coupling} in shared layer architectures, leading to reduced diversity and ineffective exploration. In this paper, we introduce Ensemble++, a novel method that addresses these challenges through architectural and algorithmic innovations. To prevent ensemble coupling, Ensemble++ decouples mean and uncertainty estimation by separating the base network and ensemble components, employs a symmetrized loss function and the stop-gradient operator. To further enhance exploration, it generates richer hypothesis spaces through random linear combinations of ensemble components using continuous index sampling. Theoretically, we prove that Ensemble++ matches the regret bounds of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits while maintaining a scalable per-step computational complexity of $\tilde{O}( \log T)$. This provides the first rigorous analysis demonstrating that ensemble sampling can be an scalable and effective approximation to Thompson Sampling, closing a key theoretical gap in exploration efficiency. Empirically, we demonstrate Ensemble++'s effectiveness in both regret minimization and computational efficiency across a range of nonlinear bandit environments, including a language-based contextual bandits where the agents employ GPT backbones. Our results highlight the capability of Ensemble++ for real-time adaptation in complex environments where computational and data collection budgets are constrained. \url{https://github.com/szrlee/Ensemble_Plus_Plus}</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for Deep Sparse Coding via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore intersections between sparse coding and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Conversational Complexity for Assessing Risk in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case in early 2023 involved journalist Kevin Roose's extended dialogue with Bing, an LLM-powered search engine, which revealed harmful outputs after probing questions, highlighting vulnerabilities in the model's safeguards. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks, like the "Grandma Jailbreak," where users framed requests as innocent help for a grandmother, easily eliciting similar content. This raises the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures to quantify this effort: Conversational Length (CL), which measures the number of conversational turns needed to obtain a specific harmful response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the harmful response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of the user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimization of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.</description>

      <title>Local Optimality of Dictator Functions with Applications to Courtade--Kumar and Li--M\'edard Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a convex function $\Phi:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, the $\Phi$-stability of a Boolean function $f$ is $\mathbb{E}[\Phi(T_{\rho}f(\mathbf{X}))]$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a random vector uniformly distributed on the discrete cube $\{\pm1\}^{n}$ and $T_{\rho}$ is the Bonami-Beckner operator. In this paper, we prove that dictator functions are locally optimal in maximizing the $\Phi$-stability of $f$ over all balanced Boolean functions. When focusing on the symmetric $q$-stability, combining this result with our previous bound, we use computer-assisted methods to prove that dictator functions maximize the symmetric $q$-stability for $q=1$ and $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ or for $q\in[1.36,2)$ and all $\rho\in[0,1]$. In other words, we confirm the (balanced) Courtade--Kumar conjecture with the correlation coefficient $\rho\in[0,0.914]$ and the (symmetrized) Li--M\'edard conjecture with $q\in[1.36,2)$. We conjecture that dictator functions maximize both the symmetric and asymmetric $\frac{1}{2}$-stability over all balanced Boolean functions. Our proofs are based on the majorization of noise operators and hypercontractivity inequalities.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Collaborative Online Personalized Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. In particular, we provide a method based on hypothesis testing coupled with differential privacy and data variance estimation. Two privacy mechanisms and two data variance estimation schemes are proposed, and we provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data. Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to ideal performance where all data is public. This illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting.</description>

      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>
