      <title>Constraining accretion physics with gravitational waves from eccentric extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eccentric, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) immersed in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei. We find that single gravitational-wave observations from these systems could provide measurements with ~ 10 % relative precision of, simultaneously, the disk viscosity and mass accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole. This is possible when the EMRI transitions, within the observation time, from supersonic to subsonic motion relative to the disk gas, for eccentricities e &gt; ~ 0.025-0.1. The estimate of the accretion rate would assist in the identification of the EMRI's host galaxy, or the observation of a direct electromagnetic counterpart, improving the chances of using these sources as cosmological sirens. Our work highlights the rich phenomenology of binary evolution in astrophysical environments and the need to improve the modelling and analysis of these systems for future gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Constraints and detection capabilities of GW polarizations with space-based detectors in different TDI combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is essential in space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, effectively reducing laser noise and improving detection precision. As one of the most promising GW detectors, the space-based detectors are able to observe the effects from GW polarizations. The detection of GW additional polarizations carries significant implications, potentially revealing deviations from general relativity and opening avenues to explore alternative gravity theories. In this study, we examine the impacts of second-generation TDI combinations on GW polarization detection by simulating LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, including realistic orbital effects such as link length and angle variations. The detector performance is assessed through sensitivity curves derived from averaged response functions, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of binary black holes (BBHs). For massive BBHs, the $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ channels typically offer the best sensitivity, while the $X$ channel in TianQin is most effective for detecting additional polarizations. For stellar-mass BBHs, the $\alpha$ channel provides the highest SNR for vector modes in LISA and Taiji specifically for lower-mass systems, while the $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ channels are optimal for higher masses or other polarizations. TianQin consistently favors the $X$ channel for additional polarizations. Our findings emphasize the importance of selecting high-sensitivity TDI combinations to enhance detection capabilities across different polarizations, deepening our insight into GW sources and the fundamental nature of spacetime</description>

      <title>Viable Wormhole Structures and Energy Conditions in f(Q,T) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores static wormhole solutions in f(Q,T) theory, where Q is the non-metricity and T is the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We derive the field equations that describe gravitational phenomena in the existence of non-metricity and matter source terms. We examine different models of this theory to determine the explicit expressions of matter contents, which are useful for analyzing the wormhole structures. We investigate the existence of feasible traversable wormhole solutions for constant and variable redshift functions. To determine whether physically viable wormhole geometry exists, we examine the graphical interpretation of energy constraints for different values of model parameters. It is found that realistic traversable and stable wormhole solutions exist only for the first model of this gravity.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) flows with the momentum scale $k$ of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Photon orbits and phase transition for gravitational decoupled Kerr anti-de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the cosmological constant as the energy of the vacuum and using a gravitational decoupling approach leads to a new Kerr--anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole. The metric of the new Kerr--AdS is simpler than the standard Kerr--AdS and exhibits richer geometry, where the effects of rotation appear as warped curvature. We investigate the relationship between unstable photon orbits and thermodynamic phase transitions in this new Kerr--AdS black hole background. We derive an exact expression for various thermodynamic properties, including mass ($M$), Hawking temperature ($T$), entropy ($S$), heat capacity ($C$), and free energy ($G$), by relating the negative cosmological constant to positive pressure through the equation $P = -\Lambda/(8 \pi) = 3/(8 \pi l^2)$, where $l$ represents the horizon radius, and by introducing its conjugate variable as the thermodynamic volume $V$. When $P &lt; P_c$, black holes with $C_P &gt; 0$ are thermodynamically stable, while those with $C_P \leq 0$ are unstable. Our analysis of the Gibbs free energy reveals a phase transition from small, globally unstable black holes to large, globally stable ones. Additionally, investigating the system's $P$-$V$ criticality and determining the critical exponents shows that our system shares similarities with a Van der Waals (vdW) fluid. In the reduced parameter space, we observe non-monotonic behavior of the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter when the pressure is below its critical value. Furthermore, we present the distribution of critical points in parameter space and derive a fitting formula for the coexistence curve.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Horndeski gravity and the ultra slowly evaporating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evaporation behaviors of asymptotically flat charged black holes in the Einstein-Horndeski gravity theory. Based on the thermodynamics of the Horndeski black hole, we present a physical understanding of the scalar charge of the Horndeski black hole and also clarify its connection to the Einstein vector theory. As the presence of non-minimal coupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly different from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case. Due to the different spacetime and electric field structures, the evaporation rate of the Horndeski black hole will slow down at the late stage of evaporation and thus gain a lifetime much longer than the RN black hole. These results illuminate the effect of non-minimally coupled matters on the black hole evaporation and provide clues to search for these matter fields in future observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational deflection of light in polar-axis plane of a moving Kerr-Newman black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational deflection of light signals restricted in the polar-axis plane of a moving Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole with a constant velocity along the polar axis is studied within the second post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation. For this purpose, the Lorentz boosting technique is adopted to obtain the exact metric of a moving KN black hole with an arbitrary constant velocity in Kerr-Schild coordinates for the first time. Based on the weak field limit of the exact metric, we then derive the equations of motion of test particles constrained in the polar-axis plane of a moving KN source whose velocity is along the polar axis and collinear with its angular momentum. An iterative technique is utilized subsequently in the calculations of the null deflection angle up to the 2PM order caused by the moving lens, and this deflection angle is found to be spin-independent. Finally, we discuss the influence of the motion of the lens on the gravitational deflection and estimate the possibility to detect this kinematical effect. Our work might be helpful for future astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of the relativistic Cowling approximation on shear and interface modes of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate shear and interface modes excited in neutron stars with an elastic crust in the full general relativistic framework and compare them to the results obtained within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We observe that the Cowling approximation has virtually no impact on the frequencies or the eigenfunctions of the shear modes; in contrast, the interface modes that arise due to the discontinuities of the shear modulus experience a shift in frequency by several percent when applying the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, we extend a scheme based on the properties of Breit-Wigner resonances, which allows us to estimate the damping times of slowly damped modes; our extension can provide an estimation of the damping time even if the features of the Breit-Wigner resonance are incomplete or if some of them violate the underlying linearity assumption. The proposed scheme is also computationally less expensive and numerically more robust and we provide accurate estimates as well as lower bounds for damping times of shear and interface modes.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures from higher-order images of moving hotspots in accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efforts to probe the horizon-scale structure of black holes, such as Event Horizon Telescope and GRAVITY interferometer, might provide valuable insights into the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of gravity. In the near field region of a black hole, the observational signatures of hotspots could potentially reveal the mechanism causing the flares, or reflect the spacetime geometries. This paper develops a ray tracing scenario to study higher-order images of moving hotspots in a thin disk around a spherical black hole. Our ray-tracing scenario establishes a one-to-one mapping between the emission locations and the observer's sky for each order image. It allows us to have infinite-precision images, because the emission sources are simply projected onto the image plane. Furthermore, we show that a source located anywhere outside the black hole can be repeatedly mapped onto the observer's sky, including primary to arbitrary-order images. For example, the points distributed near the surface of the horizon can all be imaged onto the sky. We investigate the observational signatures of the hotspots, including temporal fluxes and flux centroids, based on images from the primary to the sixth order. These hotspots are considered moving in circular, escape, and terminated orbits for given initial radii and initial azimuth angles. Our results find that the higher-order images can be categorized into two types. Within each type, the temporal fluxes exhibit self-similar tendencies. The fluxes of higher-order images alternately dominate the total flux after the hotspot is swallowed by the black hole, which subsequently result in the total flux decaying with time in an oscillatory manner.</description>

      <title>Real modes and null memory contributions in effective-one-body models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to describe real-valued $m=0$ modes from inspiral to merger and ringdown in effective-one-body models, including both oscillatory and null memory contributions. A crucial aspect of the modelization of the oscillatory part is the complexification of the real modes via a Hilbert transform. This procedure allows for an accurate description of the merger-ringdown waveform by applying standard approaches employed for the complex $m&gt;0$ modes, which include source-driven effects. The physical signal is then recovered by solely considering the real part. We apply this method in the extreme-mass-ratio regime, considering particle-driven linear gravitational perturbations in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. We then extend our description to spin-aligned, quasi-circular, comparable-mass binaries providing hierarchical fits incorporating the test-mass limit. The post-merger waveform is then matched with an inspiral effective-one-body waveform. By adopting TEOBResumS-GIOTTO as our baseline, we also include the displacement memory in the (2,0) mode through Bondi-Metzner-Sachs balance laws, thus providing a complete effective-one-body model incorporating both oscillatory and null memory effects. The accuracy of this model is validated against the hybrid numerical relativity surrogate NRHybSur3dq8_CCE, finding, for the quadrupole of the equal mass nonspinning case, a LIGO noise-weighted mismatch of $\bar{{\cal F}} = 2\cdot 10^{-4}$ at $50 M_\odot$ for the inclination that maximizes the contribution of the (2,0) mode.</description>

      <title>The spectral density of astrophysical stochastic backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the spectral density of the stochastic background generated by the superposition of coalescing compact binaries. We show how the expression often used in the literature emerges from an average over the extrinsic parameters of the binaries (times of arrival, polarization angles, arrival directions and orbit inclinations) and how the Stokes parameters related to circular and linear polarization are set to zero by such averaging procedure. We then consider the effect of shot noise, i.e. the fact that for the superposition of a finite number of sources these averages are only approximate, and we show how it generates circular and linear polarizations (even for isotropic backgrounds) as well as spatial anisotropies, and we compute them explicitly for a realistic population of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Confusion noise from astrophysical backgrounds at third-generation gravitational-wave detector networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave detector networks, compact binaries coalescences produce a ``confusion noise'' due to unresolved sources and to the error in the reconstruction of resolved sources, that can degrade the sensitivity to cosmological backgrounds. We show how to characterize from first-principles this astrophysical confusion noise by reconstructing the resolved sources at a detector network, subtracting them from the data stream of each detector of the network, and then computing the correlation among detector pairs of these ``partially cleaned'' data streams that, beside instrumental noise, contain the unresolved sources and the error on the resolved sources. In a two-detector correlation, this residual astrophysical background then acts as an effective correlated noise. We point out that its effect, in the search for a cosmological background, must be evaluated by correlating two detectors with the filter function that optimizes the given cosmological search (and not the search for the astrophysical background itself) and therefore depends on the specific cosmological signal that we want to extract from the data. We show how to obtain search-independent upper bounds on the effect of this astrophysical confusion noise, and how to characterize its actual effect on a given cosmological search. We then apply this methodology to an example of a 3G network and, for a realistic population of mergers, we evaluate explicitly the upper bound on the effect of the astrophysical confusion noise, as well as its actual effect in the search of selected examples of power-law cosmological backgrounds and of backgrounds featuring broad peaks, as in phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory of gravity in a cosmological context using the formalism of dynamical systems. We obtain the equations of motion of the theory and introduce an appropriate set of dynamical variables to allow for a direct comparison with the results from General Relativity (GR). We observe that the cosmological phase space features the same set of fixed points as in standard GR, i.e., radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, curvature-dominated, and exponentially-accelerated solutions independently of the values of the coupling function and the scalar field. Furthermore, the radiation-dominated fixed points are repellers and the exponentially accelerated fixed points are attractors in the phase space, thus allowing for cosmological solutions behaving qualitatively similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model, i.e., transitioning from a radiation-dominated phase into a matter-dominated phase, and later into a late-time cosmic acceleration phase supported by the scalar field potential. Following a reconstruction method through which we produce the cosmological solutions in the GR limit of the theory and introduce them into the general EsGB dynamical system, a numerical integration of the dynamical system shows that the EsGB theory provides cosmological solutions indistinguishable from those of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, compatible with the current observations from the Planck satellite and weak-field solar system dynamics, while maintaining the scalar field and the coupling function finite and regular throughout the entire time evolution.</description>

      <title>Fluid Models from Kinetic Models using a Geometric Averaging Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2767</link>
      <description>arXiv:0912.2767v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We interpret the Lorentz force equation as a geodesic equation associated with a non-linear connection. Using a geometric averaging procedure, we prove that for narrow and smooth one-particle distribution functions whose supports are invariant under the flow of the Lorentz equation, a bunch of charged point particles can be described by a charged cold fluid model in the ultra-relativistic regime. The method used to prove this result does not require additional hypotheses on the higher moments of the distribution. This is accomplished by estimating the expressions that include the differential operators appearing in the charged cold fluid model equation. Under the specified conditions of narrowness and ultra-relativistic dynamics, it turns out that these differential expressions are close to zero, justifying the use of the charged cold fluid model. The method presented in the work can also be applied to justify the use of warm plasmas and other models.</description>

      <title>Absorptive Effects in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define absorptive Compton amplitudes, which captures the absorption factor for waves of spin-weight-$s$ scattering in black hole perturbation theory. At the leading order, in the $G M \omega$ expansion, such amplitudes are purely imaginary and expressible as contact terms. Equipped with these amplitudes we compute the mass change in black hole scattering events via Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, where the rest mass of Schwarzschild/Kerr black hole is modified due to absorption of gravitational, electromagnetic, or scalar fields sourced by other compact object. We reproduced the power loss previously computed in the post-Newtonian expansion. The results presented here hold for similar mass ratios and generic spin orientation, while keeping the Kerr spin parameter to lie in the physical region $\chi \le 1$.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutary $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that should be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Planck-PR4 anisotropy spectra show (better) consistency with General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from a series of analyses on two parametric tests of gravity that modify the growth of linear, sub-horizon matter perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. The first test, known as the $(\mu,\Sigma)$ framework, modifies the Poisson and lensing equations from General Relativity (GR). The second test introduces the growth index $\gamma$, which directly affects the time evolution of matter density perturbations. Our study is motivated by results from the analysis of the Planck-PR3 2018 spectra, which indicate a preference for $\Sigma_0 \neq 0$ and $\gamma_0 &gt; 0.55$, both of which deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at a significance level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$. To clarify the nature of these anomalous results and understand how the lensing anomaly fits into the picture, we analyze the most recent Planck-PR4 spectra extracted from the updated \texttt{NPIPE} maps. Overall, the Planck-PR4 data show better consistency with GR. The updated likelihood \texttt{Camspec} provides constraints on $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ that are consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. The updated likelihoods \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} show even closer agreement, with all parameter values consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within $1\sigma$. This enhanced consistency is closely correlated with the lensing anomaly. Across the different likelihoods, the tendency of $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ to drift towards non-standard values matches the observed preference for $A_L &gt; 1$, both of which are significantly reduced or disappear within the Planck-PR4 data.</description>

      <title>Rotation curves of disk galaxies and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the flat rotation curves observed at large radii in disk galaxies can be interpreted as an effect of General Relativity (GR) instead of the presence of dark matter (DM) halos in Newtonian gravity. In Ciotti (2022) the problem is rigorously explored in the special setting of the weak-field, low-velocity gravitomagnetic limit of GR. The rotation curves are obtained for purely baryonic disk models with realistic density profiles, and compared with the predictions of Newtonian gravity for the same disks, in absence of DM. The rotation curves are indistinguishable, with percentual GR corrections at all radii of the order of $\approx 10^{-6}$ or less, so that DM halos are required in gravitomagnetism as in Newtonian gravity. From a more general point of view, a list of the most urgent problems that must be addressed by any proposed GR-based alternative to the existence of DM, is given.</description>

      <title>First few overtones probe the event horizon geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is broadly believed that quasinormal modes cannot tell the black-hole near-horizon geometry, because usually the low-lying modes are determined by the scattering of perturbations around the peak of the effective potential. Using the general parametrization of the black-hole spacetimes respecting the generic post-Newtonian asymptotic, we will show that tiny modifications of the Schwarzschild/Kerr geometry in a relatively small region near the event horizon lead to almost the same Schwarzschild/Kerr fundamental mode, but totally different first few overtones. Having in mind that the first several overtones affect the quasinormal ringing at its early and intermediate stage [M. Giesler, M. Isi, M. Scheel, and S. Teukolsky, Phys. Rev. X 9, 041060 (2019)], we argue that the near-horizon geometry could in principle be studied via the first few overtones of the quasinormal spectrum, which is important because corrections to the Einstein theory must modify precisely the near-horizon geometry, keeping the known weak field regime.</description>

      <title>Superradiant growth anomaly magnification in evolution of vector bosonic condensates bounded by a Kerr black hole with near-horizon reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight vector particles can form evolving condensates around a Kerr black hole (BH) due to superradiant instability. We study the effect of near-horizon reflection on the evolution of this system: by matching three pieces of asymptotic expansions of the Proca equation in Kerr metric and considering the leading order in the electric mode, we present explicit analytical expressions for the corrected spectrum and the superradiant instability rates. Particularly, in high-spin BH cases, we identify an anomalous situation where the superadiance rate is temporarily increased by the reflection parameter $\mathcal{R}$, which also occurs in the scalar scenario, but is largely magnified in vector condensates due to a faster growth rate in dominant mode. We point out the condition for the growth anomaly in the adiabatic case is that information carried per particle exceeds a certain value $\delta I/\delta N&gt;2\pi k_\text{B} \sqrt{(1+\mathcal{R})/(1-\mathcal{R})}$. We further construct several featured quantities to illustrate it, and formalize the anomaly-induced gravitational wave strain deformation.</description>

      <title>Constraining tensor-to-scalar ratio based on VLBI observations: PGWs induced-incoherence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induce a decrease of the spatial coherence length of an electromagnetic field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to eventually be unobservable, an affect called as blurring. Since this spatial correlation is actually observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational waves background. In this paper, we precisely evaluate this blurring effect by considering the primordial gravitational waves background to be in the so-called two-mode squeezed state, which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. We then exploit a sample of compact radio quasars located at redshift range $0.46\leq z \leq 2.73$ observed by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) means. These quasars constitute a standard ruler and the angular size-distance $\theta-z$ relation is determined thanks to the measurement of their spatial coherence. These spatial coherence observations set an upper limit on the squeezing parameters of the PGWs background, which turns into an upper limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $\text{r}_{k_0}$. One finds $\text{r}_{k_0} &lt; 10^{-7}$, five orders of magnitude better than present constraints on this parameter with the CMB. This result is nevertheless compatible with the possible detection of a cosmic background by the pulsar timing array measurement. Further issues and caveats that potentially affect the results are reviewed. In particular, the possible effect of quantum-to-classical transition of PGWs is discussed. Ultimately, we promote the idea of using high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources as a new possible way of constraining the background of primordial tensor perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in electrically charged black brane spacetimes that asymptote to AdS by means of the pseudospectrum. Methodologically, we adopt ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates to cast QNMs in terms of a generalised eigenvalue problem involving a non-selfadjoint operator; this simplifies the computation significantly in comparison with previous results in the literature. Our analysis reveals spectral instability for (neutral) scalar as well as gravitoelectric perturbations. This indicates that the equilibration process of perturbed black branes is sensitive to external perturbations. Particular attention is given on the hydrodynamic modes, which are found to be the least unstable. In contrast with computations in hyperboloidal coordinates, we find that the pseudospectral contour lines cross to the upper half plane. This indicates the existence of pseudo-resonances as well as the possibility of transient instabilities. We also investigate the asymptotic structure of pseudospectral contour levels and we find remarkable universality across all sectors, persistent in the extremal limit.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the information loss issue for completely evaporating black holes in the context of a globally hyperbolic spacetime that maintains unchanged the entire semiclassical picture except for the "last evaporation breath," which pertains to full quantum gravity. Even though observers outside the black hole cannot access information that enters the horizon, there is no actual loss of information imposed by the spacetime causal structure since it is carried over from one Cauchy surface to the next (provided the local evolution is unitary).</description>

Abstract: The McVittie-Plummer spacetime is a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological model that represents a spherical star system embedded in a standard FLRW cosmological model. We study the main physical properties of this gravitational field. Regarding the interplay between the physics of the local system and the expanding background, we employ the Misner-Sharp mass-energy function to show that there is a relatively weak time-dependent general relativistic coupling between the astrophysical system and the background FLRW cosmological model. The coupling term is proportional to the inverse of the scale factor and decreases as the universe expands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Hubble constant tension within $f(R)$ modified gravity in the Jordan frame, focusing on its application to the dynamics of an isotropic Universe. A scalar field, non-minimally coupled to the metric, provides an extra degree of freedom compared to General Relativity. We analyze the impact of such a scalar field on the cosmic expansion, leading to an effective Hubble constant $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$, dependent on redshift $z$. We show that our $f(R)$ model might mimic dark energy and provide an apparent variation of the Hubble constant. Our results align with recent cosmological data analysis in redshift bins, indicating a decreasing trend of the Hubble constant. The redshift dependence of $H_{0}^{\text{eff}}(z)$ might potentially reconcile measurements of the Hubble constant from probes at different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Nariai Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using both the in-out formalism and the monodromy method, we study the emission of charges from near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with the black hole event and cosmological horizons close to each other, whose near-horizon geometry is $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. The emission becomes catastrophic for a charge with energy greater than its chemical potential, whose leading exponential factor increases inversely proportional to the separation of two horizons. This effect may prevent near-extremal Nariai black holes with large charges that evaporate dominantly through the charge emission from evolving to black holes with a naked singularity, in analog to near-extremal RN-dS black holes that have the Breitenlohner-Friedman bound, below which they become stable against Hawking radiation and Schwinger effect of charge emission. The near-extremal Nariai black holes with small charges, which are close to near-extremal Schwarzschild-dS black holes, emit dominantly charge-neutral particles and evolve to black holes with increasing charge to mass ratio. We illuminate the origin of the catastrophic emission in the phase-integral formulation and monodromy method by comparing near-extremal charged Nariai black holes with near-extremal RN-dS black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale anisotropic inflation with PTA and LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple PTA collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a SGWB. As a significant source of the SGWB, SIGW receive extensive attention. We explore the influence of anisotropic primordial power spectra on second-order SIGW and derive explicit expressions for the energy density spectra. For specific anisotropic inflation models, we analyze the impacts of Finslerian inflation and gauge field inflation models on PTA and LISA and generalize the findings to model-independent scenarios. Our results indicate that current PTA observations can not rule out the existence of small-scale anisotropic primordial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship and Weak Gravity Conjectures in CFT Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing interplay between fundamental theoretical physics concepts within the context of charged black holes. Specifically, we focus on the consistency of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in the thermodynamics of conformal field theory (CFT), and restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) for AdS Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with a perfect fluid dark matter (RN-PFDM). The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in extended phase space thermodynamics (EPST), RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM parameter \( \gamma \) and the radius of AdS \( l \) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity in critical points. We conclude that the WGC is supported at the critical point of black holes, and the WCCC is also maintained, demonstrating the robustness of these conjectures within the critical ranges of black hole parameters</description>

      <title>Topology of restricted phase space thermodynamics in Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the Kerr-Sen-Ads black hole in restricted phase space. In the restricted phase space, a new parameter, central charge $C$, and its conjugate parameter $\mu$ are introduced, omitting the well-known $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We study the local and global topology of the black hole by considering the black hole solution as topological defects in the free energy landscape. We compute the winding number and the total topological number at the thermodynamic defects. For our analysis, we have considered five ensembles of Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in restricted phase space: fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$, fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$, and fixed $(\phi,\Omega, C)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge, $J$ is the angular momentum, $C$ is the central charge, $\phi$ is the electric potential conjugate to charge, $\Omega$ is the angular frequency conjugate to $J$, and finally, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, and fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$ ensembles, we find a topological charge of $+1$. In the fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$ and fixed $(\phi, \Omega, C)$ ensembles, depending on the values of the thermodynamic parameters, we find topological charges of $-1$, $0$, and $+1$. Interestingly, in ensembles where we find the topological charge to be $0$, we observe both Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions. We show that both types of these phase transitions can be studied using a common vector field, and the topological charges associated with Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for (ii) and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. The purity loss for a free quantum particle is evaluated and shown to be extremely inefficient for elementary particles but very effective for those at the Planck scale. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would easily leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>
