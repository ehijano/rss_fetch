      <title>Qi's problems on classifications of third- and fourth-order symmetric tensors by eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two fundamental problems posed by Qi regarding the sufficiency of eigenvalues for the classification of symmetric tensors in the two-dimensional setting. For $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times2\times2$ complex symmetric tensors, we establish their complete set of equivalence classes via a one-to-one correspondence with the canonical forms of their associated binary cubics and quartics. We then prove that these equivalence classes are uniquely determined by spectral invariants, specifically, the number of eigenpair classes and the multiplicities of zero eigenvalues, over the complex domain. We demonstrate that this classification does not hold in the real domain, where distinct equivalence classes can share identical spectral invariants. Finally, we extend this approach to derive canonical forms and complete classification for complex third- and fourth-order linear partial differential equations in two variables using their bijective relationship to binary forms.</description>

      <title>Finite fields whose members are the sum of a potent and a 5-potent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen et al., we confirm the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</description>

      <title>Double Yangian, Factorization, and qKZ-equation for Cotangent Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the dual $Y^*_\hbar(\mathfrak d)$ and double $DY_\hbar (\mathfrak d)$ of the Yangian $Y_\hbar (\mathfrak d)$ associated with a cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak d=T^*\mathfrak g$. We define a coherent factorization algebra version of the dual Yangian $Y_\hbar^*(\mathfrak d)^{\mathrm{co-op}}$ with opposite coproduct. Furthermore, we define a quantum vertex algebra structure on the quantum vacuum module $V_{\hbar,k}(\mathfrak d)$ of central extensions $\widehat{DY}_{\hbar,\ell} (\mathfrak d)$ of this double Yangian and show that its conformal blocks satisfy quantum KZ equations. We discuss examples of $\mathfrak d$ that arise from 3d $N=4$ gauge theories via the work of Costello-Gaiotto. These examples include Takiff Lie algebras $T^*\mathfrak g$, whose affine VOA is a large subalgebra of the chiral differential operator algebra of $G$, as well as the smallest type-A Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl} (1|1)$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructible classes of modules and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every deconstructible class of modules with all embeddings, all pure embedding and all RD-embeddings is stable. The argument is presented in the context of abstract classes of modules without amalgamation and the key idea is to construct a stable-like independence relation.
  In particular, the following classes of modules with all embeddings, all pure embedding and all RD-embeddings are shown to be stable: all free and torsion-free modules over any ring, and for each $n \geq 0$, the classes of all modules of projective and flat dimension $\leq n$ over any ring, and the class of all modules of injective dimension $\leq n$ over any right noetherian ring.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of symmetric matrices via congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies canonical forms derived from the finest simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of symmetric matrices via congruence. Our technique relies on Harrison's center theory, which is extended from a single higher degree form to multiple quadratic forms, hence a set of symmetric matrices. The algebraic structures of centers and the bijective relationship between the simultaneous block diagonalization via congruence and complete sets of orthogonal idempotents of centers are investigated. We provide an algorithm that mainly uses standard linear algebra tasks and several examples to demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, this technique can be extended verbatim to the simultaneous block diagonalization of a set of Hermitian matrices via $*$-congruence.</description>

      <title>Subset expansions of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the expansion $\mathcal{S}(M)$ of a monoid $M$ obtained via the semidirect product of $M$ acting naturally on the left of its power set (regarded as a semilattice under union). We term this the `subset expansion' of $M$. The monoid $\mathcal{S}(M)$ contains the images of several expansions of $M$ of wide interest and use in semigroup theory, in particular the prefix and Szendrei expansions (in the case where $M$ is free, these `smaller' expansions produce free algebras in certain varieties).
  We first focus on algebraic properties, specifically those determined by idempotents. Particularly, we show that the expansion $\mathcal{S}$ maps groups to proper inverse monoids, unipotent monoids to proper left restriction monoids, right cancellative monoids to left ample monoids, right abundant monoids to right abundant monoids, and left cancellative monoids to right adequate monoids.
  Subsequently, we focus on finitary conditions. We examine the condition of weak left coherence (every finitely generated left ideal has a finite presentation as a left act); the related conditions of property (L), left ideal Howson, finitely left equated, and each of the corresponding left-right dual notions. Each of these conditions is preserved under retract, from which it is immediate that if $\mathcal{S}(M)$ satisfies one of our finitary conditions, then so must $M$, but the converse is not true. For a property to `lift' from $M$ to $\mathcal{S}(M)$ it must undergo a strengthening. Indeed, we show that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ satisfies property (L) (or its left-right dual) if and only if $M$ is finite. We provide exact characterisations of the monoids $M$ such that $\mathcal{S}(M)$ is: left (or right) ideal Howson; finitely left equated; and (consequently) weakly left coherent. We give sufficient conditions for $\mathcal{S}(M)$ to be finitely right equated and hence weakly right coherent.</description>

      <title>A Homological Separation of $\mathbf{P}$ from $\mathbf{NP}$ via Computational Topology and Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the separation of complexity classes $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{NP}$ through a novel homological algebraic approach grounded in category theory. We construct the computational category $\mathbf{Comp}$, embedding computational problems and reductions into a unified categorical framework. By developing computational homology theory, we associate to each problem $L$ a chain complex $C_{\bullet}(L)$ whose homology groups $H_n(L)$ capture topological invariants of computational processes. Our main result demonstrates that problems in $\mathbf{P}$ exhibit trivial computational homology ($H_n(L) = 0$ for all $n &gt; 0$), while $\mathbf{NP}$-complete problems such as SAT possess non-trivial homology ($H_1(\mathrm{SAT}) \neq 0$). This homological distinction provides the first rigorous proof of $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$ using topological methods. Our work inaugurates computational topology as a new paradigm for complexity analysis, offering finer distinctions than traditional combinatorial approaches and establishing connections between structural complexity theory and homological invariants.</description>
