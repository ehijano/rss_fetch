      <title>Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum cohomology possesses the structure of a difference module by shift operators (Seidel representation) of equivariant parameters. Teleman's conjecture suggests that shift operators and equivariant parameters acting on QH_T(X) should be identified, respectively, with the Novikov variables and the quantum connection of the GIT quotient X//T. This can be interpreted as a form of Fourier duality between equivariant quantum cohomology (D-module) of X and quantum cohomology (D-module) of the GIT quotient X//T.
  We introduce the notion of "quantum volume," derived from Givental's path integral over the Floer fundamental cycle, and present a conjectural Fourier duality relationship between the T-equivariant quantum volume of X and the quantum volume of X//T. We also explore the "reduction conjecture," developed in collaboration with Fumihiko Sanda, which expresses the I-function of X//T as a discrete Fourier transform of the equivariant J-function of X. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use Fourier analysis of equivariant quantum cohomology to observe toric mirror symmetry and prove a decomposition of quantum cohomology D-modules of projective bundles or blowups.</description>

On the other hand, given a plane curve singularity $Y\subset \mathbb{C}^2$ we study the family of matrix factorizations defined by the space curve singularities $X\subset \mathbb{C}^3$ such that $Y$ is the generic plane projection of $X$.</description>

      <title>Incidence equivalence and the Bloch-Beilinson filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over an arbitrary base field $k$ and $CH^n(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ be the $\mathbb Q$-vector space of codimension $n$ algebraic cycles of $X$ modulo rational equivalence, $1\leq n \leq d$. Consider the $\mathbb Q$-vector subspaces $CH^n(X)_{\mathbb Q} \supseteq CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)_{\mathbb Q} \supseteq CH^n_{\mathrm{inc}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ of algebraic cycles which are, respectively, algebraically and incident (in the sense of Griffiths) equivalent to zero.
  Our main result computes $CH^d_{\mathrm{inc}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ (which coincides with the Albanese kernel $T(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ when $k$ is algebraically closed) in terms of Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives $DM_k$, namely, we show that $CH^d_{\mathrm{inc}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ is given by the second step of the orthogonal filtration $F^{\bullet}$ on $CH^d(X)_{\mathbb Q}$, i.e. $F^2 CH^d (X)_{\mathbb Q}= CH^d_{\mathrm{inc}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$. The orthogonal filtration $F^\bullet$ on $CH^n(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ was introduced by the first author, and is an unconditionally finite filtration satisfying several of the properties of the still conjectural Bloch-Beilinson filtration.
  We also prove that the exterior product and intersection product of algebraic cycles algebraically equivalent to zero is contained in the second step of the orthogonal filtration.
  Furthermore, if we assume that the field $k$ is either finite or the algebraic closure of a finite field, then the main result holds in any codimension, i.e. $F^2 CH^n_{\mathrm{alg}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}= CH^n_{\mathrm{inc}}(X)_{\mathbb Q}$. We also compute in the whole Chow group, $CH^n(X)_{\mathbb Q}$, the second step of the orthogonal filtration $F^2 CH^n(X)_{\mathbb Q}$ in terms of the vanishing of several intersection pairings.</description>

      <title>Rationality and categorical properties of the moduli of instanton bundles on the projective 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the rationality and irreducibility of the moduli space of mathematical instanton vector bundles of arbitrary rank and charge on $\mathbb P^3$. In particular, the result applies to the rank-2 case. This problem was first studied by Barth, Hartshorne, Hirschowitz-Narasimhan in the late 1970s. We also show that the mathematical instantons of variable rank and charge form a monoidal category. The proof is based on an in-depth analysis of the Barth-Hulek monad-construction and on a detailed description of the moduli space of (framed and unframed) stable bundles on Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Hodge decomposition of L_2-cohomology and intersection cohomology of a Shimura variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Hodge theory endows the square integrable cohomology of a Shimura variety X with values in a locally homogeneous polarized variation of Hodge structure E with a natural Hodge decomposition. The theory of Morihiko Saito does the same for the E-valued intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of X. Existing proofs of the Zucker conjecture identify these cohomology groups, but do not claim this for their Hodge decompositions. We show that one of the proofs yields that as well.</description>

      <title>Orientifolds for F-theory on K3 Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study F-theory orientifolds, starting with products of two elliptic curves, but focusing mostly on a family of K3 surfaces, lattice polarized by the rank-17 lattice $\langle 8 \rangle \oplus 2D_8(-1)$, generalizing the family (to which it degenerates) of Kummer surfaces of products of two non-isogenous elliptic curves. After a thorough study of the complex geometry of this family and its elliptic fibrations, we proceed to study real structures on the K3 surfaces in the family which are equivariant with respect to an elliptic fibration. We also study the physics of the associated F-theory orientifolds with a particular focus on the impact of the real structure on the charge spectrum. We also study how these orientifolds degenerate to the case of isotrivial Kummer surface fibrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository work, we promote the study of function spaces parameterized by machine learning models through the lens of algebraic geometry. To this end, we focus on algebraic models, such as neural networks with polynomial activations, whose associated function spaces are semi-algebraic varieties. We outline a dictionary between algebro-geometric invariants of these varieties, such as dimension, degree, and singularities, and fundamental aspects of machine learning, such as sample complexity, expressivity, training dynamics, and implicit bias. Along the way, we review the literature and discuss ideas beyond the algebraic domain. This work lays the foundations of a research direction bridging algebraic geometry and deep learning, that we refer to as neuroalgebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On generically non-reduced components of Hilbert schemes of smooth curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:1409.6012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical example of Mumford gives a generically non-reduced component of the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves in the projective 3-space such that a general element of the component is contained in a smooth cubic hypersurface in the projective 3-space. In this article we use techniques from Hodge theory to give further examples of such (generically non-reduced) components of Hilbert schemes of smooth curves without any restriction on the degree of the hypersurface containing it. As a byproduct we also obtain generically non-reduced components of certain Hodge loci.</description>

      <title>Shifted bisymplectic and double Poisson structures on non-commutative derived prestacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of shifted bisymplectic and shifted double Poisson structures on differential graded associative algebras, and more generally on non-commutative derived moduli functors with well-behaved cotangent complexes. For smooth algebras concentrated in degree $0$, these structures recover the classical notions of bisymplectic and double Poisson structures, but in general they involve an infinite hierarchy of higher homotopical data, ensuring that they are invariant under quasi-isomorphism. The structures induce shifted symplectic and shifted Poisson structures on the underlying commutative derived moduli functors, and also on underlying representation functors.
  We show that there are canonical equivalences between the spaces of shifted bisymplectic structures and of non-degenerate $n$-shifted double Poisson structures. We also give canonical shifted bisymplectic and bi-Lagrangian structures on various derived non-commutative moduli functors of modules over Calabi--Yau dg categories.
  Unlike their commutative counterparts, these structures enjoy a formal integration property, which we exploit to show that Calabi--Yau and pre-Calabi--Yau structures on a dg algebra correspond respectively to bisymplectic and double Poisson structures on its quotient prestacks by the adjoint $\mathbb{G}_m$-action.</description>

Abstract: Let $(G, X)$ be a Shimura datum, let $\Omega$ be a connected component of $X$, let $\Gamma$ be a congruence subgroup of $G(\mathbb{Q})^{+}$, and consider the quotient map $q: \Omega \to S:=\Gamma \backslash \Omega$. Consider the Harish-Chandra embedding $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^{N}$, where $N=\dim X$. We prove two results that give geometric conditions which if satisfied by an algebraic variety $V \subset \mathbb{C}^{N} \times S$, ensure that there is a Zariski dense subset of $V$ of points of the form $(x,q(x))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11836v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An action of a complex reductive group $\mathrm G$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ is regular when all regular unipotent elements in $\mathrm G$ act with finitely many fixed points. Then the complex $\mathrm G$-equivariant cohomology ring of $X$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of a certain regular fixed point scheme. Examples include partial flag varieties, smooth Schubert varieties and Bott-Samelson varieties. We also show that a more general version of the fixed point scheme allows a generalisation to GKM spaces, such as toric varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we consider compact Riemann surfaces that are uniquely determined by the property of possessing a group of automorphisms of a prescribed order, strengthening uniqueness results proved by Nakagawa. More precisely, we deal with the cases in which such an order is $3g$ and $3g+3,$ where $g$ is the genus. We prove that if $g$ is odd (respectively $g$ even and $g \not \equiv 2 \mbox{ mod } 3$) then there exists a unique Riemann surface of genus $g$ with a group of automorphisms of order $3g$ (respectively $3g+3$). A similar conclusion can be derived in terms of orientably-regular hypermaps. In addition, we determine the full automorphism group of such Riemann surfaces and provide decompositions of their Jacobians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unify problems about the equivariant geometry of symmetric quiver representation varieties, in the finite type setting, with the corresponding problems for symmetric varieties $GL(n)/K$ where $K$ is an orthogonal or symplectic group. In particular, we translate results about singularities of orbit closures; combinatorics of orbit closure containment; and torus equivariant cohomology and K-theory between these classes of varieties. We obtain these results by constructing explicit embeddings with nice properties of homogeneous fiber bundles over type $A$ symmetric quiver representation varieties into symmetric varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is the last of the series of articles where we reprove the foundational ideas of abstract six-functor formalisms developed by Liu-Zheng. We prove the theorem of partial adjoints, which is a simplicial technique of encoding various functors altogether by taking adjoints along specific directions. Combined with the $\infty$-categorical compactification theorem from the previous article, we can construct abstract six-functor formalisms in reasonable geometric setups of our interest. We also reprove the simplified versions of the DESCENT program due to Liu-Zheng, which allows us to extend such formalisms from smaller to larger geometric setups.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth affine group scheme $G$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers and a cocharacter $\mu$ of $G$, we develop the deformation theory for $G$-$\mu$-displays over the prismatic site of Bhatt-Scholze, and discuss how our deformation theory can be interpreted in terms of prismatic $F$-gauges introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt-Lurie. As an application, we prove the local representability and the formal smoothness of integral local Shimura varieties with hyperspecial level structure. We also revisit and extend some classification results of $p$-divisible groups.</description>

      <title>Towards combinatorial characterization of the smoothness of Hessenberg Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{Hessenberg Schubert variety} is an irreducible component of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety, defined as the closure of a Schubert cell inside the Hessenberg variety. We consider the smoothness of Hessenberg Schubert varieties of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties of type $A$ in this paper.
  We consider the smoothness of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety to ensure the smoothness of the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety. Specifically, we analyze the structure of the GKM graphs of the intersection of a Schubert variety indexed by some special permutations and a Hessenberg variety. The regularity of the GKM graph is completely characterized in terms of pattern avoidance, which is a necessary (and also sufficient conjecturally) condition for the intersection to be smooth. We then extend the pattern avoidance result to all permutations, which is believed to be a sufficient condition for the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety to be smooth.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Otal and Rosas [41], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [30].</description>

      <title>A smooth Birman-Hilden theory for hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article grew out of an effort to understand the smooth mapping class groups of certain 4-manifolds in a geometric manner. We prove a smooth analog of the Birman-Hilden theorem for manifolds that admit a hyperk\"ahler structure. This allows us to probe the smooth mapping class groups associated to certain manifolds with nontrivial fundamental groups. Along the way, and of independent interest, we prove a global Torelli theorem for generalized Enriques manifolds. The techniques used are analogous to Teichm\"uller-theoretic methods in the classical theory of mapping class groups. We apply this hyperk\"ahler Birman-Hilden theorem to obtain results regarding smooth, metric, and complex Nielsen realization on Enriques surfaces.</description>

      <title>$q$-Witt vectors and $q$-Hodge complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23078v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we'll introduce a $q$-variant of Witt vectors and de Rham-Witt complexes. This variant is closely related to the Habiro ring of a number field constructed by Garoufalidis, Scholze, Wheeler, and Zagier, to $q$-Hodge cohomology, and to $\operatorname{THH}(-/\mathrm{ku})$. While most of these connections will only be explored in forthcoming work, the goal of this article is to provide the necessary technical foundation.</description>
