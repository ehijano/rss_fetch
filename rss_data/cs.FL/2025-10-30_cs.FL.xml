      <title>Systems of Graph Formulas and their Equivalence to Alternating Graph Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based modeling plays a fundamental role in many areas of computer science. In this paper, we introduce systems of graph formulas with variables for specifying graph properties; this notion generalizes the graph formulas introduced in earlier work by incorporating recursion. We show that these formula systems have the same expressive power as alternating graph automata, a computational model that extends traditional finite-state automata to graphs, and allows both existential and universal states. In particular, we provide a bidirectional translation between formula systems and alternating graph automata, proving their equivalence in specifying graph languages. This result implies that alternating graph automata can be naturally represented using logic-based formulations, thus bridging the gap between automata-theoretic and logic-based approaches to graph language specification.</description>

      <title>Formalization of Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in Lean4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalized a complete proof of the Auslander--Buchsbaum--Serre criterion in the Lean4 theorem prover. For a local ring, rather than following the well-known proof that considers the residue field as the quotient of the ring by a regular sequence to compute projective dimension and uses the Koszul complex to show the dimension of the cotangent space is at most the global dimension, we prove the criterion via maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules and a weakened version of the Ferrand--Vasconcelos theorem, which is more amenable to the formalization process and the current development of mathlib. Our formalization includes the construction of depth and of Cohen--Macaulay modules and rings, which are used frequently in the proof of the criterion. We also developed related results, including the unmixedness theorem for Cohen--Macaulay rings and Hilbert's Syzygy theorem.</description>

      <title>Have a thing? Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither logical tradition can normally permit the direct expression of arbitrary general-recursive functions without inconsistency. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a minimalistic but nonetheless powerful foundation for formal reasoning that allows the direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts the traditional inference rules such that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., "bottom") instead of leading into logical paradox or inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked consistency proof in Isabelle/HOL exists for the basic quantifier-free fragment of GA. Quantifiers may be added atop this foundation as ordinary computations, whose inference rules are thus admissible and do not introduce new inconsistency risks. While GA is only a first step towards richly-typed grounded deduction practical for everyday use in manual or automated computational reasoning, it shows the promise that the expressive freedom of arbitrary recursive definition can in principle be incorporated into formal systems.</description>

      <title>On a sequence of Kimberling and its relationship to the Tribonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Clark Kimberling defined an interesting sequence ${\bf B} = 0100101100 \cdots$ of $0$'s and $1$'s by certain inflation rules, and he made a number of conjectures about this sequence and some related ones. In this note we prove his conjectures using, in part, the Walnut theorem-prover. We show how his word is related to the infinite Tribonacci word, and we determine both the subword complexity and critical exponent of $\bf B$.</description>
