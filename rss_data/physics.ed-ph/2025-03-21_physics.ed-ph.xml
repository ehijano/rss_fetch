      <title>Schematic Representation Method for Quantum Circuits: An Intuitive Approach to Quantum Gate Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum circuits, qubits and the quantum gates acting on them have traditionally been analysed using matrix algebra and Dirac notation. While powerful, these can be unintuitive for conceptual understanding and rapid problem solving. In this work, a new schematic representation method is developed that visualizes the effects of quantum gates on qubits without relying on complex mathematical operations. In the new notation, quantum bits (qubits) are represented using black (0) and white (1) circles. When a quantum gate is applied to a qubit, the circle representing the qubit is visually modified. For example, a Hadamard gate transforms a solid black or white circle into a half-black and half-white circle representing superposition. The work shows how this method simplifies the visualization of quantum algorithms, entanglement, and multi-qubit operations. Thus, the effects of quantum circuits can be analysed with simple schematic representations without having to go into complex mathematical operations.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to measure evidence of students' sensemaking in physics courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the education system, problem-solving correctness is often inappropriately conflated with student learning. Advances in both Physics Education Research (PER) and Machine Learning (ML) provide the initial tools to develop a more meaningful and efficient measurement scheme for whether physics students are engaging in sensemaking: a learning process of figuring out the how and why for a particular phenomena. In this work, we contribute such a measurement scheme, which quantifies the evidence of students' physical sensemaking given their written explanations for their solutions to physics problems. We outline how the proposed human annotation scheme can be automated into a deployable ML model using language encoders and shared probabilistic classifiers. The procedure is scalable for a large number of problems and students. We implement three unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a deployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023 Introduction to Physics course at Tufts University. Furthermore, we compute sensemaking scores for all students, and analyze these measurements alongside their corresponding problem-solving accuracies. We find no linear relationship between these two variables, supporting the hypothesis that one is not a reliable proxy for the other. We discuss how sensemaking scores can be used alongside problem-solving accuracies to provide a more nuanced snapshot of student performance in physics class.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics of classical spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the geometry behind classical Heisenberg model at the level suitable for third or fourth year students who did not have the opportunity to take a course on differential geometry. The arguments presented here rely solely on elementary algebraic concepts such as vectors, dual vectors and tensors, as well as Hamiltonian equations and Poisson brackets in their simplest form. We derive Poisson brackets for classical spins, along with the corresponding equations of motion for classical Heisenberg model, starting from the geometry of two-sphere, thereby demonstrating the relevance of standard canonical procedure in the case of Heisenberg model.</description>
