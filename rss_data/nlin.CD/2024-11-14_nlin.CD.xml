      <title>Conceptualizing the chaotic perception, demands and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One propounded theory for the presence of chaos in biological neural networks is that it could be involved in discriminating different olfactory stimuli. Inspired by the idea, in this paper, we define the visual ``chaotic perception'' and spell out the challenges we face when conceptualizing it.</description>

      <title>Intensity landscapes in elliptical and oval billiards with a circular absorbing region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billiard models of single particles moving freely in two-dimensional regions enclosed by hard walls, have long provided ideal toy models for the investigation of dynamical systems and chaos. Recently, billiards with (semi-)permeable walls and internal holes have been used to study open systems. Here we introduce a billiard model containing an internal region with partial absorption. The absorption does not change the trajectories, but instead reduces an intensity variable associated with each trajectory. The value of the intensity can be tracked as a function of the initial configuration and the number of reflections from the wall and depicted in intensity landscapes over the Poincar\'e phase space. This is similar in spirit to escape time diagrams that are often considered in dynamical systems with holes. We analyse the resulting intensity landscapes for three different geometries; a circular, elliptic, and oval billiard, respectively, all with a centrally placed circular absorbing region. The intensity landscapes feature increasingly more complex structures, organised around the sets of points that are a particular number of iteration away from the absorbing region, and enriched by effects arising from multiple absorption events for a given trajectory.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Reconstruction of Gappy Lagrangian Turbulent Signals by Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a stochastic method for reconstructing missing spatial and velocity data along the trajectories of small objects passively advected by turbulent flows with a wide range of temporal or spatial scales, such as small balloons in the atmosphere or drifters in the ocean. Our approach makes use of conditional generative diffusion models, a recently proposed data-driven machine learning technique. We solve the problem for two paradigmatic open problems, the case of 3D tracers in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and 2D trajectories from the NOAA-funded Global Drifter Program. We show that for both cases, our method is able to reconstruct velocity signals retaining non-trivial scale-by-scale properties that are highly non-Gaussian and intermittent. A key feature of our method is its flexibility in dealing with the location and shape of data gaps, as well as its ability to naturally exploit correlations between different components, leading to superior accuracy, with respect to Gaussian process regressions, for both pointwise reconstruction and statistical expressivity. Our method shows promising applications also to a wide range of other Lagrangian problems, including multi-particle dispersion in turbulence, dynamics of charged particles in astrophysics and plasma physics, and pedestrian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two types of quantum chaos: testing the limits of the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two types of quantum chaos: eigenbasis chaos and spectral chaos. The first type controls the early-time physics, e.g. the thermal relaxation and the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It can be traced back to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The second type concerns very late-time physics, e.g. the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. It can be traced back to Random Matrix Universality (RMU), a statistical hypothesis about the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture asserts a direct relationship between the two types of chaos for quantum systems with a chaotic semiclassical limit. The BGS conjecture is challenged by the Poissonian Hamiltonian ensembles, which can be used to model any quantum system displaying RMU. In this paper, we start by analyzing further aspects of such ensembles. On general and numerical grounds, we argue that these ensembles can have chaotic semiclassical limits. We then study the Poissonian ensemble associated with the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. While the distribution of couplings peaks around the original SYK model, the Poissonian ensemble is not $k$-local. This suggests that the link between ETH and RMU requires of physical $k$-locality as an assumption. We test this hypothesis by modifying the couplings of the SYK Hamiltonian via the Metropolis algorithm, rewarding directions in the space of couplings that do not display RMU. The numerics converge to a $k$-local Hamiltonian with eigenbasis chaos but without spectral chaos. We finally comment on ways out and corollaries of our results.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugei-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugei-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>
