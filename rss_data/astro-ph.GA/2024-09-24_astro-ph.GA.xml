      <title>StreamGen: Connecting Populations of Streams and Shells to Their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study how the abundance and dynamics of populations of disrupting satellite galaxies change systematically as a function of host galaxy properties. We apply a theoretical model of the phase-mixing process to classify intact satellite galaxies, stellar stream-like and shell-like debris in ~1500 Milky Way-mass systems generated by a semi-analytic galaxy formation code, SatGen. In particular, we test the effect of host galaxy halo mass, disk mass, ratio of disk scale height to length, and stellar feedback model on disrupting satellite populations. We find that the counts of tidal debris are consistent across all host galaxy models, within a given host mass range, and that all models can have stream-like debris on low-energy orbits, consistent with those observed around the Milky Way. However, we find a preference for stream-like debris on lower-energy orbits in models with a thicker (lower-density) host disk or on higher-energy orbits in models with a more-massive host disk. Importantly, we observe significant halo-to-halo variance across all models. These results highlight the importance of simulating and observing large samples of Milky Way-mass galaxies and accounting for variations in host properties when using disrupting satellites in studies of near-field cosmology.</description>

      <title>Loki: an ancient system hidden in the Galactic plane?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse high-resolution ESPaDOnS/CFHT spectra of 20 very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$&lt;-2.0$) in the solar neighbourhood (within $\sim2$ kpc) selected to be on planar orbits (maximum height of $&lt;4$ kpc). Targets include 11 prograde and 9 retrograde stars, spanning a wide range of eccentricities ($0.20-0.95$). Their chemical abundances are consistent with those observed in the Galactic halo but show a smaller spread, with no notable difference between progrades and retrogrades. This suggests a common chemical evolution and likely a shared formation site (except for one star). In this case, chemical evolution models indicate that the formation site would have had a baryonic mass of $\sim1.4\times10^9\msun$, similar to classical dwarf galaxies. High-energy supernovae and hypernovae are needed to reproduce the [X/Fe] up to the Fe-peak, while fast-rotating massive stars and neutron star merger events explain the [X/Fe] of the neutron-capture elements. The absence of Type Ia supernova signatures suggests a star formation duration of $&lt;1$Gyr. Cosmological zoom-in simulations support the scenario that an in-plane infall of a single system could disperse stars over a wide range of angular momenta during the early Galactic assembly. We propose that these stars originated in a proto-Galactic building block, which we name \textit{Loki}. Less likely, if progrades and retrogrades formed in two different systems, their chemical evolution must have been very similar, with a combined baryonic mass twice that of a single system. The low number of targets and their limited metallicity range prevent us to exclude if these stars share a common progenitor with other detected structures, like GSE. A comparison (primarily [$\alpha$/Fe]) with other VMPs moving in planar orbits suggests multiple systems contributed to the Galactic planar population, presenting some differences in their kinematical parameters.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Constraints on the Cosmic-Ray Ionization Rate and Other Physical Conditions in NGC 253 with ALCHEMI Measurements of HCN and HNC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a neural network model and ALMA observations of HCN and HNC to constrain the physical conditions, most notably the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR, zeta), in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. Using output from the chemical code UCLCHEM, we train a neural network model to emulate UCLCHEM and derive HCN and HNC molecular abundances from a given set of physical conditions. We combine the neural network with radiative transfer modeling to generate modeled integrated intensities, which we compare to measurements of HCN and HNC from the ALMA Large Program ALCHEMI. Using a Bayesian nested sampling framework, we constrain the CRIR, molecular gas volume and column densities, kinetic temperature, and beam-filling factor across NGC 253's CMZ. The neural network model successfully recovers UCLCHEM molecular abundances with about 3 percent error and, when used with our Bayesian inference algorithm, increases the parameter inference speed tenfold. We create images of these physical parameters across NGC 253's CMZ at 50 pc resolution and find that the CRIR, in addition to the other gas parameters, is spatially variable with zeta a few times 10^{14} s^{-1} at greater than 100 pc from the nucleus, increasing to zeta greater than 10^{-13} s^{-1} at its center. These inferred CRIRs are consistent within 1 dex with theoretical predictions based on non-thermal emission. Additionally, the high CRIRs estimated in NGC 253's CMZ can be explained by the large number of cosmic-ray-producing sources as well as a potential suppression of cosmic-ray diffusion near their injection sites.</description>

      <title>Kinematic analysis of $\mathbf{z = 4.3}$ galaxies in the SPT2349$-$56 protocluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPT2349$-$56 is a protocluster discovered in the 2500 deg$^2$ South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. In this paper, we study the kinematics of the galaxies found in the core of SPT2349$-$56 using high-resolution (1.55 kpc spatial resolution at $z = 4.303$) redshifted [CII] 158-$\mu$m data. Using the publicly available code 3D-Barolo, we analyze the seven far-infrared (FIR) brightest galaxies within the protocluster core. Based on conventional definitions for the detection of rotating discs, we classify six sources to be rotating discs in an actively star-forming protocluster environment, with weighted mean $V_{\mathrm{rot}}/\sigma_{\mathrm{disp}} = 4.5 \pm 1.3$. The weighted mean rotation velocity ($V_{\mathrm{rot}}$) and velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\mathrm{disp}}$) for the sample are $ 357.1 \pm 114.7$ km s$^{-1}$ and $43.5 \pm 23.5$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. We also assess the disc stability of the galaxies and find a mean Toomre parameter of $Q_\mathrm{T} = 0.9 \pm 0.3$. The galaxies show a mild positive correlation between disc stability and dynamical support. Using the position-velocity maps, we find that five sources further classify as disturbed discs, and one classifies as a strictly rotating disc. Our sample joins several observations at similar redshift with high $V/\sigma$ values, with the exception that they are morphologically disturbed, kinematically rotating and interacting galaxies in an extreme protocluster environment.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Number of Radio Sources Seen by Both VLASS and LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio surveys typically sample extragalactic sources in higher redshift regimes than is typical for optical surveys, resulting in many radio sources not having a detected optical counterpart. Over the next decade the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will be performing the deepest ($i &lt; 26.4\,$mag) wide-area optical survey to date increasing the fraction of radio sources for which we have optical data. In this Research Note we use the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey to analyse how the fraction of radio sources in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) with optical detections varies as a function of $i$-band magnitude and extrapolate to predict the number of optical counterparts we expect LSST to detect. Assuming a final VLASS point source depth of $S_{3\,\text{GHz}}\lesssim350\,\mu$Jy, we expect LSST to identify optical counterparts to $\sim 10^6$ radio sources in VLASS.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat IV: Constraining Ages of Omega Centauri sub-giant branch stars with HST and MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present age estimates for over 8100 sub-giant branch (SGB) stars in Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) to study its star formation history. Our large data set, which combines multi-wavelength HST photometry with MUSE metallicities, provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure individual stellar ages. We do this by fitting each star's photometry and metallicity with theoretical isochrones, that are embedded with an empirical [C+N+O]-[Fe/H] relation specifically for $\omega$ Cen. The bulk of the stars have ages between 13 and 10 Gyr, with the mean stellar age being 12.08$\pm$0.01 Gyrs and the median age uncertainty being 0.68 Gyrs. From these ages we construct the most complete age-metallicity relation (AMR) for $\omega$ Cen to date. We find that the mean age of stars decreases with increasing metallicity and find two distinct streams in the age-metallicity plane, hinting at different star formation pathways. We derive an intrinsic spread in the ages of 0.75$\pm$0.01 Gyr for the whole cluster, with the age spread showing a clear increase with metallicity. We verify the robustness of our age estimations by varying isochrone parameters and constraining our systematics. We find the C+N+O relation to be the most critical consideration for constraining the AMR. We also present the SGB chromosome map with age information. In the future, these stellar ages could be combined with chemical abundances to study age differences in subpopulations, and uncover the chemical evolution history of this massive nuclear star cluster.</description>

      <title>Using dust to constrain dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type haloes to explore using dust as an observational tracer to discriminate between cold and warm dark matter universes. Comparing a cold and 3.5keV warm dark matter particle model, we tune the efficiency of galaxy formation in our simulations using a variable supernova rate to create Milky Way systems with similar satellite galaxy populations while keeping all other simulation parameters the same. Cold dark matter, having more substructure, requires a higher supernova efficiency than warm dark matter to achieve the same satellite galaxy number. These different supernova efficiencies create different dust distributions around their host galaxies, which we generate by post-processing the simulation output with the POWDERDAY codebase. Analysing the resulting dust in each simulation, we find $\sim$4.5 times more dust in our cold dark matter Milky Way halos compared with warm dark matter. The distribution of dust out to R$_{200\text{c}}$ is then explored, revealing that the warm dark matter simulations are noticeably less concentrated than their cold dark matter counterparts, although differences in substructure complicate the comparison. Our results indicate that dust is a possible unique probe to test theories of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Photometric Redshift Catalogs Through Color-Space Analysis: Application to KiDS-Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to refine photometric redshift galaxy catalogs by comparing their color-space matching with overlapping spectroscopic calibration data. We focus on cases where photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are estimated empirically. Identifying galaxies that are poorly represented in spectroscopic data is crucial, as their photo-$z$ may be unreliable due to extrapolation beyond the training sample. Our approach uses a self-organizing map (SOM) to project a multi-dimensional parameter space of magnitudes and colors onto a 2-D manifold, allowing us to analyze the resulting patterns as a function of various galaxy properties. Using SOM, we compare the Kilo-Degree Survey bright galaxy sample (KiDS-Bright), limited to $r&lt;20$ mag, with various spectroscopic samples, including the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA). Our analysis reveals that GAMA under-represents KiDS-Bright at its faintest ($r\gtrsim19.5$) and highest-redshift ($z\gtrsim0.4$) ranges, however no strong trends in color or stellar mass. By incorporating additional spectroscopic data from the SDSS, 2dF, and early DESI, we identify SOM cells where photo-$z$ are estimated suboptimally. We derive a set of SOM-based criteria to refine the photometric sample and improve photo-$z$ statistics. For the KiDS-Bright sample, this improvement is modest: exclusion of the least represented 20% of the sample reduces photo-$z$ scatter by less than 10%. We conclude that GAMA, used for KiDS-Bright photo-$z$ training, is sufficiently representative for reliable redshift estimation across most of the color space. Future spectroscopic data from surveys such as DESI should be better suited for exploiting the full improvement potential of our method.</description>

      <title>Probing the rest-frame wavelength dependence of Quasar variability : Insights from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Quasar variability can potentially unlock crucial insights into the accretion process. Understanding how this variability is influenced by wavelength is crucial for validating and refining quasar variability models. Aims. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the dependence of variability on rest-frame wavelength by isolating the variance on different time scales in well-defined wavelength bins and examining the Corona-heated Accretion-disk (CHAR) model. Methods. We investigated the relation between variance and rest-frame wavelength using optical g and r-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 15 for 5000 quasars within narrow ranges of black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($R_{Edd}$). A spectral model taking into account disk continuum emission, Balmer transitions and Fe II pseudo-continuum emission, and other emission lines is necessary to best interpret the variance spectrum. Results. Our analysis indicates a strong anti-correlation between median variance and rest-frame wavelength for quasars with $M_{BH} = 10^{8}$ and $R_{Edd} = 10^{-1}$ at different timescales. This anti-correlation is more pronounced at shorter timescales. The results align well with a bending power-law Power Spectrum Density (PSD) model with both the damping timescale and the high-frequency slope of the PSD depending on wavelength. The accurate predictions provided by the CHAR model on the variance spectrum across most timescales studied showcases its potential in constraining temperature variations within the accretion disk.

      <title>Unveiling Multiple Physical Processes on a Cluster Galaxy at z=0.3 Using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of a previously identified candidate ``jellyfish'' galaxy in the Abell 2744 cluster, F0083, which showed faint signs of a tidal interaction in archival imaging. We used publicly available, PSF-matched deep photometric data from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes, to infer the spatially-resolved star-formation history of this galaxy. F0083 shows clear signs of ram-pressure stripping (RPS), with a recently enhanced star-formation rate (SFR) orientated towards the South-West quadrant of the stellar disc. The stellar mass surface density is heavily asymmetric, with a variation of nearly 1 dex between the Western spiral arm and the postulated tidal feature. This feature appears to contain a high proportion of older stars, ruling out RPS as the cause of this ``unwinding''. An investigation of nearby galaxies reveals the most probable interaction candidate to be a compact elliptical galaxy, 28171, of mass $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm{M}_{\odot})=8.53\pm0.04$ embedded in the tidal stream along our line-of-sight. The star-formation history of the tidal feature indicates a steep change in SFR at lookback times $t_L\lesssim1\,$Gyr. The most probable formation scenario of F0083 thus indicates a low-speed interaction with 28171, followed by RPS as the combined system approaches pericentre passage. Our results demonstrate the ability of photometric data to distinguish between these consecutive processes.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos, or free-floating supermassive black holes (SMBHs), that might be comprised of primordial black holes (PBHs), in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9 M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz, and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. Using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and their mimickers. Using the above constraints, we rule out 32 out of our initial 40 candidates as milli-lenses, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we find many new candidates for compact symmetric objects, that are thought to be short-lived, jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the SMILE (Search for MIlli-LEnses) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>

      <title>Are all starbursts equal? Star-formation-rate profiles in merger versus secular starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interactions can trigger drastic changes in the resolved star-forming properties of their constituents, but it remains unclear as to whether those changes are discernible from secular starburst triggers. In this Letter we investigate whether or not post-merger galaxies create unique star-forming trends on a kiloparsec scale. We present radial trends in star-formation-rate (SFR) surface density ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) for 150 post-merger galaxies with moderate to extremely heightened global SFRs using observations from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We juxtapose these profiles with those of noninteracting galaxies (excluding both galaxy pairs and post-merger galaxies) with similarly enhanced global SFRs. Post-merger galaxies have a much stronger central starburst than isolated galaxies with similar global star-formation enhancements. Indeed, isolated starburst galaxies (SBs) lack a marked central enhancement and instead show a fairly uniform enhancement in $\Sigma_{SFR}$ with radius. Moreover, the difference in central star formation between post-merger galaxies and noninteracting galaxies is more radially extended and pronounced when the global enhancement in star formation is larger. We conclude that post-merger galaxies create a unique signature in their resolved star-forming properties that is distinct from secular processes that can trigger similar global SFR enhancements.</description>

      <title>Metallicity-dependent kinematics and orbits in the Milky Way's nuclear stellar disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear stellar disc (NSD) is a flat and dense stellar structure at the centre of the Milky Way. Previous work has identified the presence of metal-rich and metal-poor stars in the NSD, suggesting that they have different origins. The recent publication of photometric, metallicity, proper motion, and orbital catalogues allows the NSD stellar population to be characterised with unprecedented detail. We aim to explore the proper motions and orbits of NSD stars with different metallicities to assess whether they have different origins and to better understand the metallicity distribution in the NSD. We distinguished between metal-rich and metal-poor stars by applying a Gaussian mixture model, as done in previous work, and analysed the proper motions, orbits, and spatial distribution of stars with different metallicities. We find that metal-rich stars exhibit a lower velocity dispersion, suggesting that they trace a kinematically cooler component compared to metal-poor ones. Furthermore, z-tube orbits are predominant among metal-rich stars, while chaotic/box orbits are more common among metal-poor ones. We also find that metal-rich and metal-poor stars show a similar extinction and are present throughout the analysed regions. As a secondary result, we detected a metallicity gradient in the metal-rich population with higher metallicity towards the centre of the NSD and a tentative gradient for the metal-poor stars, which is consistent with previous studies that did not distinguish between the two populations. Our results suggest that metal-rich stars trace the NSD, whereas metal-poor ones are related to the Galactic bar and probably constitute Galactic bar interlopers and/or are NSD stars that originated from accreted clusters. The detected metallicity gradients aligns with the currently accepted inside-out formation of the NSD.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of dark star clusters II: The impact of primordial mass segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of primordial mass segregation on the formation and evolution of dark star clusters (DSCs). Considering a wide range of initial conditions, we conducted $N$-body simulations of globular clusters (GCs) around the Milky Way. In particular, we assume a canonical IMF for all GCs without natal kicks for supernovae remnants, namely neutron stars or black holes. Our results demonstrate that clusters with larger degrees of primordial mass segregation reach their DSC phase earlier and spend a larger fraction of their dissolution time in such a phase, compared to clusters without mass segregation. In primordially segregated clusters, the maximum Galactocentric distance that the clusters can have to enter the DSC phase is almost twice that of the clusters without primordial mass segregation. Primordially segregated clusters evolve with a higher number of stellar mass black holes, accelerating energy creation in their central regions and consequently increasing evaporation rates and cluster sizes during dark phases. The simulations reveal that aggregating heavy components at the centre doubles the time spent in the dark phase. Additionally, the study identifies potential links between simulated dark clusters and initial conditions of Milky Way globular clusters, suggesting some may transition to dark phases before dissolution. Higher primordial mass segregation coefficients amplify the average binary black hole formation rate by 2.5 times, raising higher expectations for gravitational wave emissions.</description>

      <title>The Statistics and Environments of Hostless Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient surveys routinely detect supernovae (SNe) without obvious host galaxies. To understand the demographics of these "hostless" SNe and to constrain the possible host properties, we identify 161 SNe reported to the Transient Name Server since 2016 that do not have hosts cataloged from pre-explosion wide-field galaxy surveys. Using forced aperture photometry, we detect excess flux around only 56 of these SNe. Both thermonuclear and core-collapse (CC) SNe are present in our sample. Compared to flux-limited SNe samples with known hosts, superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), particularly hydrogen-deficient SLSNe, are over-represented here relative to all other SNe types; among CC SNe, there is also a higher fraction of interacting SNe than non-interacting. On the low-luminosity side, seven SNe have host absolute magnitude upper limits fainter than M_g=-12, about 1 per cent of the Small Magellanic Cloud's luminosity; the faintest limits are close to the luminosity of globular clusters or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (M_g~-8). Fitting multi-band forced photometry, 11 SNe have host stellar masses &lt;10^6 Msun assuming quiescent hosts, and 13 SNe have host stellar masses &lt;10^5 Msun assuming star-forming hosts. The spatial distribution of hostless SNe indicates that the majority are not associated with known galaxy groups and clusters, ruling out intracluster stellar light as the primary contributor of such SNe. Hostless Type Ia SNe tend to be more luminous and slow-fading than SNe Ia with known host galaxies, implying a hidden population of low-mass and star-forming hosts. We conclude that any undetected host galaxies are likely star-forming dwarfs in the field.</description>

Abstract: It is demonstrated through a succinct derivation as to how the linear waves in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) constitute a fundamental departure from the standard MHD waves. Apart from modifying the conventional MHD spectrum, the Hall current induces a distinct and new branch consisting of purely circularly polarized waves that may become the representative shear waves.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. The Localized and Chemically rich Features near the Bases of the Protostellar Jet in HOPS 87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HOPS 87 is a Class 0 protostellar core known to harbor an extremely young bipolar outflow and a hot corino. We report the discovery of localized, chemically rich regions near the bases of the two-lobe bipolar molecular outflow in HOPS 87 containing molecules such as H$_2$CO, $^{13}$CS, H$_2$S, OCS, and CH$_3$OH, the simplest complex organic molecule (COM). The locations and kinematics suggest that these localized features are due to jet-driven shocks rather than being part of the hot corino region encasing the protostar. The COM compositions of the molecular gas in these jet-localized regions are relatively simpler than those in the hot corino zone. We speculate that this simplicity is due to either the liberation of ice with a less complex chemical history or the effects of shock chemistry. Our study highlights the dynamic interplay between the protostellar bipolar outflow, disk, inner core environment, and the surrounding medium, contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in solar-like young stellar objects.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Tension in our own Backyard: DESI and the Nearness of the Coma Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration measured a tight relation between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the distance to the Coma cluster using the fundamental plane (FP) relation of the deepest, most homogeneous sample of early-type galaxies. To determine $H_0$, we measure the distance to Coma by several independent routes each with its own geometric reference. We measure the most precise distance to Coma from 12 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) in the cluster with mean standardized brightness of $m_B^0=15.712\pm0.041$ mag. Calibrating the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia with the HST distance ladder yields $D_{\textrm Coma}=98.5\pm2.2$ Mpc, consistent with its canonical value of 95--100 Mpc. This distance results in $H_0=76.5 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc from the DESI FP relation. Inverting the DESI relation by calibrating it instead to the Planck+$\Lambda$CDM value of $H_0=67.4$ km/s/Mpc implies a much greater distance to Coma, $D_{\textrm Coma}=111.8\pm1.8$ Mpc, $4.6\sigma$ beyond a joint, direct measure. Independent of SNe Ia, the HST Key Project FP relation as calibrated by Cepheids, Tip of the Red Giant Branch from JWST, or HST NIR surface brightness fluctuations all yield $D_{\textrm Coma}&lt;$ 100 Mpc, in joint tension themselves with the Planck-calibrated route at $&gt;3\sigma$. From a broad array of distance estimates compiled back to 1990, it is hard to see how Coma could be located as far as the Planck+$\Lambda$CDM expectation of $&gt;$110 Mpc. By extending the Hubble diagram to Coma, a well-studied location in our own backyard whose distance was in good accord well before the Hubble Tension, DESI indicates a more pervasive conflict between our knowledge of local distances and cosmological expectations. We expect future programs to refine the distance to Coma and nearer clusters to help illuminate this new, local window on the Hubble Tension.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Multi-band Galaxy Observations with Large Language Model-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical research traditionally relies on extensive domain knowledge to interpret observations and narrow down hypotheses. We demonstrate that this process can be emulated using large language model-based agents to accelerate research workflows. We propose mephisto, a multi-agent collaboration framework that mimics human reasoning to interpret multi-band galaxy observations. mephisto interacts with the CIGALE codebase, which includes spectral energy distribution (SED) models to explain observations. In this open-world setting, mephisto learns from its self-play experience, performs tree search, and accumulates knowledge in a dynamically updated base. As a proof of concept, we apply mephisto to the latest data from the James Webb Space Telescope. mephisto attains near-human proficiency in reasoning about galaxies' physical scenarios, even when dealing with a recently discovered population of "Little Red Dot" galaxies. This represents the first demonstration of agentic research in astronomy, advancing towards end-to-end research via LLM agents and potentially expediting astronomical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances for a Sample of FGK dwarfs in the Pleiades Open Cluster from APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents chemical abundances of twelve elements (C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for 80 FGK dwarfs in the Pleiades open cluster, which span a temperature range of $\sim$2000 K in T$_{\rm eff}$, using the high-resolution (R$\sim$22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV/APOGEE spectra ($\lambda$1.51--1.69 \micron). Using a 1D LTE abundance analysis, we determine an overall metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.03$\pm$0.04 dex, with the elemental ratios [$\alpha$/Fe]=+0.01$\pm$0.05, [odd-z/Fe]=-0.04$\pm$0.08, and [iron peak/Fe]=-0.02$\pm$0.08. These abundances for the Pleiades are in line with the abundances of other open clusters at similar galactocentric distances as presented in the literature. Examination of the abundances derived from each individual spectral line revealed that several of the stronger lines displayed trends of decreasing abundance with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. The list of spectral lines that yield abundances that are independent of $T_{\rm eff}$ are presented and used for deriving the final abundances. An investigation into possible causes of the temperature-dependent abundances derived from the stronger lines suggests that the radiative codes and the APOGEE line list we employ may inadequately model van der Waals broadening, in particular in the cooler K dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are thought to be the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (&gt; 20 SNR, fGW &gt; 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.</description>

      <title>Do assumptions about the central density of subhaloes affect dark matter annihilation and lensing calculations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests that the central density of cuspy dark matter subhaloes is conserved in minor mergers. However, empirical models of subhalo evolution, calibrated from simulations, often assume a drop in the central density. Since empirical models of subhaloes are used in galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and dark matter annihilation calculations, we explore the consequences of assuming different subhalo models. We find that dark matter annihilation calculations are very sensitive to the assumed subhalo mass profile, and different models can give more than a magnitude difference in the J-factor and boost factor in individual haloes. On the other hand, the shear and convergence profiles used in galaxy-galaxy lensing are sensitive to the initial profile assumed (e.g., NFW versus Einato) but are otherwise well-approximated by a simple model in which the original profile is sharply truncated. We conclude that since the innermost parts of haloes are difficult to resolve in simulations, it is important to have a theoretical understanding of how subhaloes evolve to make accurate predictions of the dark matter annihilation signal.</description>

      <title>Gas Assisted Binary Black Hole Formation in AGN Discs</title>

Abstract: We investigate close encounters by stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a potential formation channel of binary black holes (BBHs). We perform a series of 2D isothermal viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code Athena++. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas gravitation and inertial forces. To probe the dependence of capture on the initial conditions, we discuss a suite of 345 simulations spanning local AGN disc density ($\rho_0$) and impact parameter ($b$) space. We identify a clear region in $b - \rho_0$ space where gas assisted BBH capture is efficient. We find that the presence of gas leads to strong energetic dissipation during close encounters between unbound BHs, forming stably bound eccentric BBHs. We find that the gas dissipation during close encounters increases for systems with increased disc density and deeper periapsis passages $r_p$, fitting a power law such that $\Delta E \propto \rho_0^{\alpha}r_p^{\beta}$ where $\{\alpha,\beta\} = \{1.01\pm0.04,-0.43\pm0.03\}$. Alternatively, the gas dissipation is approximately $\Delta E = 4.3 M_\text{d} v_\text{H} v_p$, where $M_\text{d} $ is the mass of a single BH minidisc just prior to the encounter when the binary separation is $2r_\text{H}$ (two binary Hill radii), $v_\text{H}$ and $v_p$ are the relative BH velocities at $2r_\text{H}$ and at the first closest approach, respectively. We derive a prescription for capture which can be used in semi-analytical models of AGN. We do not find the dissipative dynamics observed in these systems to be in agreement with the simple gas dynamical friction models often used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hot gas accretion fuels star formation faster than cold accretion in high redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use high-resolution ($\simeq$ 35pc) hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate the relation between gas accretion and star formation in galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes of mass $10^{12}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z = 2$. At high redshift, cold-accreted gas is expected to be readily available for star formation, while gas accreted in a hot mode is expected to require a longer time to cool down before being able to form stars. Contrary to these expectations, we find that the majority of cold-accreted gas takes several hundred Myr longer to form stars than hot-accreted gas after it reaches the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM). Approximately 10% of the cold-accreted gas flows rapidly through the inner CGM onto the galactic disc. The remaining 90% is trapped in a turbulent accretion region that extends up to $\sim$ 50 per cent of the virial radius, from which it takes several hundred Myr for the gas to be transported to the star-forming disc. In contrast, most hot shock-heated gas avoids this 'slow track', and accretes directly from the CGM onto the disc where stars can form. We find that shock-heating of cold gas after accretion in the inner CGM and supernova-driven outflows contribute to, but do not fully explain, the delay in star formation. These processes combined slow down the delivery of cold-accreted gas to the galactic disc and consequently limit the rate of star formation in Milky Way mass galaxies at $z &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases from constant stellar mass-to-light ratio assumption in galaxy dynamics and strong lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A constant stellar mass-to-light ratio $M_\star/L$ has been widely-used in studies of galaxy dynamics and strong lensing, which aim at disentangling the mass distributions of dark matter and baryons. However, systematic biases arising from constant $M_\star/L$ assumption have not been fully quantified. In this work, we take massive early-type galaxies from the TNG100 simulation to investigate possible systematic biases in the inferences due to a constant $M_\star/L$ assumption. We construct two-component matter density models, where one component describes the dark matter, the other for the stars, which is made to follow the light profile by assuming a constant $M_\star/L$. We fit the two-component model directly to the {\it total} matter density distributions of simulated galaxies to eliminate systematics coming from other model assumptions. We find that galaxies generally have more centrally-concentrated stellar mass profile than their light distribution. Given the light profiles adopted (i.e., single- and double-S{\'e}rsic profiles), the assumption of a constant $M_\star/L$ would artificially break the model degeneracy {\it for non-constant} $M_\star/L$ systems. For such systems, without knowing the true $M_{\star}/L$ but assuming a constant ratio, the two-component modeling procedure tend to generally overestimate $M_{\star}/L$ by $30\%-50\%$, and underestimate the central dark matter fraction $f_{\rm DM}$ by $\sim 20\%$ on average.</description>

      <title>Redshift-dependent galaxy formation efficiency at $z=5-13$ in the FirstLight simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current models of the formation of first galaxies predict low masses and faint objects at extremely high redshifts, z=9-15. However, the first observations of this epoch indicate a higher-than-expected number of bright (sometimes massive) galaxies. Numerical simulations can help to elucidate the mild evolution of the bright end of the UV luminosity function and they can provide the link between the evolution of bright galaxies and variations of the galaxy formation efficiency across different redshifts. We use the FirstLight database of 377 zoom-in cosmological simulations of a mass-complete sample of galaxies. Mock luminosities are estimated by a dust model constrained by current observations of an evolution of the beta-MUV relation at high-z. FirstLight contains a high number of bright galaxies, MUV&lt;-20, consistent with current data at z=6-13. The evolution of the UV cosmic density is driven by the evolution of the galaxy efficiency and the relation between MUV and halo mass. The efficiency of galaxy formation increases significantly with redshift at a fixed halo mass because galactic halos at extremely high redshifts convert gas into stars at a higher rate than at lower redshifts. The high gas densities in galaxies at z&gt;9 enable these high efficiencies. Our simulations predict higher number densities of massive galaxies, Ms=10^9 Msun, than other models with constant efficiency. Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with self-consistent models of star formation and feedback can reproduce the different regimes of galaxy formation across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>The MUSE eXtremely Deep Field: Detections of circumgalactic SiII* emission at z&gt;~2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) serves as a baryon reservoir that connects galaxies to the intergalactic medium and fuels star formation. The spatial distribution of the metal-enriched cool CGM has not yet been directly revealed at cosmic noon (z~2-4), as bright emission lines at these redshifts are not covered by optical integral field units. To remedy this situation, we aim for the first-ever detections and exploration of extended SiII* emission (low-ionization state, LIS), referred to as ``SiII* halos'', at redshifts ranging from z=2 to 4 as a means to trace the metal-enriched cool CGM. We use a sample of 39 galaxies with systemic redshifts of z=2.1-3.9 measured with the [CIII] doublet in the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog, which contains integration times spanning from ~30 to 140 hours. We search for extended SiII*1265, 1309, 1533 emission (fluorescent lines) around individual galaxies. We also stack a subsample of 14 UV-bright galaxies. We report five individual detections of SiII*1533 halos. We also confirm the presence of SiII*1533 halos in stacks for the subsample containing UV-bright sources. The other lines do not show secure detections of extended emission in either individual or stacking analyses. These detections may imply that the presence of metal-enriched CGM is a common characteristic for UV-bright galaxies. To investigate whether the origin of SiII* is continuum pumping as suggested in previous studies, we check the consistency of the equivalent width (EW) of SiII* emission and the EW of SiII absorption for the individual halo object with the most reliable detection. We confirm the equivalence, suggesting that photon conservation works for this object and pointing toward continuum pumping as the source of SiII*. We also investigate SiII* lines in a RAMSES-RT zoom-in simulation including continuum pumping and find ubiquitous presence of extended halos.</description>

      <title>Methane Formation Efficiency on Icy Grains: Role of Adsorption States</title>

Abstract: Methane (CH4) is one of the major components of the icy mantle of cosmic dust prevalent in cold, dense regions of interstellar media, playing an important role in the synthesis of complex organic molecules and prebiotic molecules. Solid CH4 is considered to be formed via the successive hydrogenation of C atoms accreting onto dust: C + 4H -&gt; CH4. However, most astrochemical models assume this reaction on the ice mantles of dust to be barrierless and efficient, without considering the states of adsorption. Recently, we found that C atoms exist in either the physisorbed or chemisorbed state on compact amorphous solid water, which is analogous to an interstellar ice mantle. These distinct adsorption states considerably affect the hydrogenation reactivity of the C atom. Herein, we elucidate the reactivities of physisorbed and chemisorbed C atoms with H atoms via sequential deposition and co-deposition processes. The results indicate that only physisorbed C atoms can produce CH4 on ice. Combining this finding with a previous estimate for the fraction of physisorbed C atoms on ice, we determined the upper limit for the conversion of C atoms into CH4 to be 30%.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the informativity of emission lines to infer physical conditions in giant molecular clouds. I. Application to model predictions</title>

Abstract: Observations of ionic, atomic, or molecular lines are performed to improve our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the potential of a line to constrain the physical conditions of the ISM is difficult to assess quantitatively, because of the complexity of the ISM physics. The situation is even more complex when trying to assess which combinations of lines are the most useful. Therefore, observation campaigns usually try to observe as many lines as possible for as much time as possible. We search for a quantitative statistical criterion to evaluate the constraining power of a (or combination of) tracer(s) with respect to physical conditions in order to improve our understanding of the statistical relationships between ISM tracers and physical conditions and helps observers to motivate their observation proposals. The best tracers are obtained by comparing the mutual information between a physical parameter and different sets of lines. We apply this method to simulations of radio molecular lines emitted by a photodissociation region similar to the Horsehead Nebula that would be observed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We search for the best lines to constrain the visual extinction $A_v^{tot}$ or the far UV illumination $G_0$. The most informative lines change with the physical regime (e.g., cloud extinction). Short integration time of the CO isotopologue $J=1-0$ lines already yields much information on the total column density most regimes. The best set of lines to constrain the visual extinction does not necessarily combine the most informative individual lines. Precise constraints on $G_0$ are more difficult to achieve with molecular lines. They require spectral lines emitted at the cloud surface (e.g., [CII] and [CI] lines). This approach allows one to better explore the knowledge provided by ISM codes, and to guide future observation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Candidate ram-pressure stripped galaxies in six low-redshift clusters revealed from ultraviolet imaging</title>

Abstract: The assembly of galaxy clusters is understood to be a hierarchical process with a continuous accretion of galaxies over time, which increases the cluster size and mass. Late-type galaxies that fall into clusters can undergo ram-pressure stripping, forming extended gas tails within which star formation can happen. The number, location, and tail orientations of such galaxies provide clues about the galaxy infall process, the assembly of the cluster over time, and the consequences of infall for galaxy evolution. Here, we utilise the $\sim$ 0.5 degree diameter circular field of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope to image six galaxy clusters at z &lt; 0.06 that are known to contain jellyfish galaxies. We searched for stripping candidates in the ultraviolet images of these clusters, which revealed 54 candidates showing signs of unilateral extra-planar emission, due to ram-pressure stripping. Seven candidates had already been identified as likely stripping based on optical B-band imaging. We identified 47 new candidates through UV imaging. Spectroscopic redshift information is available for 39 of these candidate galaxies, of which 19 are associated with six clusters. The galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that are not part of the clusters appear to be within structures at different redshifts identified as additional peaks in the redshift distribution of galaxies, indicating that they might be ram-pressure stripped or disturbed galaxies in other structures along the line of sight. We examine the orbital history of these galaxies based on their location in the position-velocity phase-space diagram and explore a possible connection to the orientation of the tail direction among cluster member candidates. The tails of confirmed cluster member galaxies are found to be oriented away from the cluster centre.</description>

      <title>A Luminous X-ray AGN in the Dwarf-Dwarf Galaxy Merger RGG 66</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray AGN in the dwarf galaxy merger RGG 66. The black hole is predicted to have a mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5.4} M_\odot$ and to be radiating close to its Eddington limit ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.75$). The AGN in RGG 66 is notable both for its presence in a late-stage dwarf-dwarf merger and for its luminosity of $L_{\rm 2-10~keV} = 10^{42.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is among the most powerful AGNs known in nearby dwarf galaxies. The X-ray spectrum has a best-fit photon index of $\Gamma = 2.4$ and an intrinsic absorption of $N_H \sim 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. These results come from a follow-up {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory} study of four irregular/disturbed dwarf galaxies with evidence for hosting AGNs based on optical spectroscopy.
  The remaining three dwarf galaxies do not have detectable X-ray sources with upper limits of $L_{\rm 2-10~ keV} \lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Taken at face value, our results on RGG 66 suggest that mergers may trigger the most luminous of AGNs in the dwarf galaxy regime, just as they are suspected to do in more massive galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Physical conditions in Centaurus A's northern filaments II: Does the HCO$^+$ emission highlight the presence of shocks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abridged: We present the first observation of the HCO+(1-0) and HCN(1-0) emission in the northern filaments of Centaurus A with ALMA. HCO+(1-0) is detected in 9 clumps of the Horseshoe complex, with similar velocities as the CO(1-0) emission. Conversely, the HCN(1-0) is not detected and we derive upper limits on the flux. At a resolution of ~40 pc, the line ratio of the velocity-integrated intensities I_HCO+/I_CO varies between 0.03 and 0.08, while I_HCO+/I_HCN is higher than unity with an average lower limit of 1.51. These ratios are significantly higher than what is observed in nearby star-forming galaxies. Moreover, the ratio I_HCO+/I_CO decreases with increasing CO integrated intensity, contrary to what is observed in the star-forming galaxies. This indicates that the HCO+ emission is enhanced and may not arise from dense gas within the Horseshoe complex. This hypothesis is strengthened by the average line ratio I_HCN/I_CO&lt;0.03 which suggests that the gas density is rather low. Using non-LTE, large velocity gradient modelling with RADEX, we explored two possible phases of the gas, that we call "diffuse" and "dense", and are characterised by a significant difference in the HCO+ relative abundance to CO, respectively N_HCO+/N_CO=10^-3 and 3x10^-5. The average CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) integrated intensities and the upper limit on HCN(1-0) are compatible with both "diffuse" and "dense" gas. The spectral setup of the present observations also covers the SiO(2-1). While undetected, the upper limit on SiO(2-1) is not compatible with the RADEX predictions for the "dense" gas. We conclude that the 9 molecular clouds detected in HCO+(1-0) are likely dominated by diffuse molecular gas. While the exact origin of the HCO+(1-0) emission remains to be investigated, it is likely related to the energy injection within the molecular gas that prevents gravitational collapse and star formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave packets propagating in inhomogeneous media experience a coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, follow spin-dependent trajectories. These phenomena, well known in optics and condensed matter physics, are referred to as spin Hall effects. Similarly, the gravitational spin Hall effect is expected to affect the propagation of gravitational waves on curved spacetimes. In this general-relativistic setup, the curvature of spacetime acts as impurities in a semiconductor or inhomogeneities in an optical medium, leading to a frequency- and polarization-dependent propagation of wave packets. In this letter, we study this effect for strong-field lensed gravitational waves generated in hierarchical triple black hole systems in which a stellar-mass binary merges near a more massive black hole. We calculate how the gravitational spin Hall effect modifies the gravitational waveforms and show its potential for experimental observation. If detected, these effects will have profound implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of close encounters between stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), during which binary black holes (BBHs) may form. We consider a suite of 2D viscous hydrodynamical simulations within a shearing box prescription using the Eulerian grid code Athena++. We study formation scenarios where the fluid is either an isothermal gas or an adiabatic mixture of gas and radiation in local thermal equilibrium. We include the effects of viscous and shock heating, as well as optically thick cooling. We co-evolve the embedded BHs with the gas, keeping track of the energetic dissipation and torquing of the BBH by gas and inertial forces. We find that compared to the isothermal case, the minidiscs formed around each BH are significantly hotter and more diffuse, though BBH formation is still efficient. We observe massive blast waves arising from collisions between the radiative minidiscs during both the initial close encounter, and subsequent periapsis periods for successfully bound BBHs. These "disc novae" have a profound effect, depleting the BBH Hill sphere of gas and injecting energy into the surrounding medium. In analysing the thermal emission from these events, we observe periodic peaks in local luminosity associated with close encounters/periapses, with emission peaking in the optical/near-IR. In the AGN outskirts, these outbursts can reach 4% of the AGN luminosity in the IR band, with flares rising over 0.5-1year. Collisions in different disc regions, or when treated in 3D with magnetism, may produce more prominent flares.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>

Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.</description>

      <title>Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids Observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Provide a New Anchor for the SH0ES Distance Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present phase-corrected photometric measurements of 88 Cepheid variables in the core of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the first sample obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3, in the same homogeneous photometric system as past measurements of all Cepheids on the SH0ES distance ladder. We limit the sample to the inner core and model the geometry to reduce errors in prior studies due to the nontrivial depth of this cloud. Without crowding present in ground-based studies, we obtain an unprecedentedly low dispersion of 0.102 mag for a period-luminosity (P-L) relation in the SMC, approaching the width of the Cepheid instability strip. The new geometric distance to 15 late-type detached eclipsing binaries in the SMC offers a rare opportunity to improve the foundation of the distance ladder, increasing the number of calibrating galaxies from three to four. With the SMC as the only anchor, we find H$_0\!=\!74.1 \pm 2.1$ km/s/Mpc. Combining these four geometric distances with our HST photometry of SMC Cepheids, we obtain H$_0\!=\!73.17 \pm 0.86$ km/s/Mpc. By including the SMC in the distance ladder, we also double the range where the metallicity ([Fe/H]) dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation can be calibrated, and we find $\gamma = -0.234 \pm 0.052$ mag/dex. Our local measurement of H$_0$ based on Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae shows a 5.8$\sigma$ tension with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming a Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, reinforcing the possibility of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}-10^1\right)\,$s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}-10^{-19}\right)\,$eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}-10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos. We consider the concrete case of the DUNE facility, where the coupling can be tested down to $g \simeq 10^{-27}$ for neutrinos coming from a supernova event at a distance $d = 10\,$kpc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pulsars, Magnetars, and Fast Radio Bursts in the Sculptor Galaxy using MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), located in the Southern Hemisphere, far off the Galactic Plane, has a relatively high star-formation rate of about 7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and hosts a young and bright stellar population, including several super star clusters and supernova remnants. It is also the first galaxy, apart from the Milky Way Galaxy to be associated with two giant magnetar flares. As such, it is a potential host of pulsars and/or fast radio bursts in the nearby Universe. The instantaneous sensitivity and multibeam sky coverage offered by MeerKAT therefore make it a favourable target. We searched for pulsars, radio-emitting magnetars, and fast radio bursts in NGC 253 as part of the TRAPUM large survey project with MeerKAT. We did not find any pulsars during a four-hour observation, and derive a flux density limit of 4.4 $\mu$Jy at 1400 MHz, limiting the pseudo-luminosity of the brightest putative pulsar in this galaxy to 54 Jy kpc$^2$. Assuming universality of pulsar populations between galaxies, we estimate that detecting a pulsar as bright as this limit requires NGC 253 to contain a pulsar population of $\gtrsim$20 000. We also did not detect any single pulses and our single pulse search flux density limit is 62 mJy at 1284 MHz. Our search is sensitive enough to have detected any fast radio bursts and radio emission similar to the brighter pulses seen from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 if they had occurred during our observation.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic viscose accretion disk around a distorted kerr black hole (DKB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a thin disk around the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider this accretion disk around the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin, an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. We obtain dynamical quantities around a distorted rotating black hole disk. Additionally, we examine how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB. We also investigate the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB.</description>
