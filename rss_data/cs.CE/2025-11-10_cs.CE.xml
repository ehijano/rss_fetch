      <title>Connectomics Informed by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tractography is a unique method for mapping white matter connections in the brain, but tractography algorithms suffer from an inherent trade-off between sensitivity and specificity that limits accuracy. Incorporating prior knowledge of white matter anatomy is an effective strategy for improving accuracy and has been successful for reducing false positives and false negatives in bundle-mapping protocols. However, it is challenging to scale this approach for connectomics due to the difficulty in synthesising information relating to many thousands of possible connections. In this work, we develop and evaluate a pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to generate quantitative priors for connectomics, based on their knowledge of neuroanatomy. We benchmark our approach against an evaluation set derived from a gold-standard tractography atlas, identifying prompting techniques to elicit accurate connectivity information from the LLMs. We further identify strategies for incorporating external knowledge sources into the pipeline, which can provide grounding for the LLM and improve accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how the LLM-derived priors can augment existing tractography filtering approaches by identifying true-positive connections to retain during the filtering process. We show that these additional connections can improve the accuracy of a connectome-based model of pathology spread, which provides supporting evidence that the connections preserved by the LLM are valid.</description>

      <title>Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</description>

      <title>Aethorix v1.0: An Integrated Scientific AI Agent for Scalable Inorganic Materials Innovation and Industrial Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining the frontiers of scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to meteorological modeling, yet its integration within industrial manufacturing remains nascent and fraught with operational challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce Aethorix v1.0, an AI agent framework designed to overcome key industrial bottlenecks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in materials design innovation and process parameter optimization. Our tool is built upon three pillars: a scientific corpus reasoning engine that streamlines knowledge retrieval and validation, a diffusion-based generative model for zero-shot inverse design, and specialized interatomic potentials that enable faster screening with ab initio fidelity. We demonstrate Aethorix's utility through a real-world cement production case study, confirming its capacity for integration into industrial workflows and its role in revolutionizing the design-make-test-analyze loop while ensuring rigorous manufacturing standards are met.</description>

      <title>Toward Engineering AGI: Benchmarking the Engineering Design Capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern engineering, spanning electrical, mechanical, aerospace, civil, and computer disciplines, stands as a cornerstone of human civilization and the foundation of our society. However, engineering design poses a fundamentally different challenge for large language models (LLMs) compared with traditional textbook-style problem solving or factual question answering. Although existing benchmarks have driven progress in areas such as language understanding, code synthesis, and scientific problem solving, real-world engineering design demands the synthesis of domain knowledge, navigation of complex trade-offs, and management of the tedious processes that consume much of practicing engineers' time. Despite these shared challenges across engineering disciplines, no benchmark currently captures the unique demands of engineering design work. In this work, we introduce EngDesign, an Engineering Design benchmark that evaluates LLMs' abilities to perform practical design tasks across nine engineering domains. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on factual recall or question answering, EngDesign uniquely emphasizes LLMs' ability to synthesize domain knowledge, reason under constraints, and generate functional, objective-oriented engineering designs. Each task in EngDesign represents a real-world engineering design problem, accompanied by a detailed task description specifying design goals, constraints, and performance requirements. EngDesign pioneers a simulation-based evaluation paradigm that moves beyond textbook knowledge to assess genuine engineering design capabilities and shifts evaluation from static answer checking to dynamic, simulation-driven functional verification, marking a crucial step toward realizing the vision of engineering Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</description>

      <title>STARC-9: A Large-scale Dataset for Multi-Class Tissue Classification for CRC Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-class tissue-type classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) histopathologic images is a significant step in the development of downstream machine learning models for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</description>
