      <title>Sparse Distribution of Coefficients of $\ell$-fold Product $L$-functions at Integers Represented by Quadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f \in S_{k}(\Gamma_{0}(N))$ be a normalized Hecke eigenform. We study the Fourier coefficients $\lambda_{f \otimes \cdots \otimes_{\ell} f}(n)$ of the $\ell$-fold product $L$-function for odd $\ell \ge 3$. Our focus is the distribution of this sequence over the sparse set of integers represented by a primitive, positive-definite binary quadratic form $Q$ of a fixed discriminant $D$. We establish an explicit upper bound for the summatory function of these coefficients, with dependencies on the weight, level, and discriminant. As a key application, we provide a bound for the first sign change of the sequence in this setting. We also generalize this result to find the first sign change among integers represented by any of the $h(D)$ forms of discriminant $D$, showing the bound improves as the class number increases.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Periods and Selmer Scheme Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chabauty--Kim method was developed with the aim of approaching effective Faltings', the problem of explicitly determining the finite set of rational points on a hyperbolic curve. This method has seen success with the more particular Quadratic Chabauty method, but this method still applies only to certain curves. Previous applications of Chabauty--Kim beyond the quadratic level, as pursued by the authors, by S. Wewers, and by others, use mixed Tate motives and the $p$-adic period map of Chatzistamatiou-\"Unver to approach the particular hyperbolic curve $\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$.
  The main purpose of this article is to lay foundations for extending the above approach to more general hyperbolic curves, in particular by defining an analogous $p$-adic period map for more general categories of motives and their non-conjectural cousins such as systems of realizations and $p$-adic Galois representations. We use this to describe a general setup for non-abelian Chabauty for an arbitrary hyperbolic curve.
  Our period map also connects the study of $p$-adic iterated integrals with Goncharov's theory of motivic iterated integrals, and allows us to investigate Goncharov's conjectures from a $p$-adic point of view. In particular, it suggests the possibility of evaluating syntomic regulators by writing elements of $K$-theory in terms of motivic iterated integrals. Lastly, it forms the basis for a certain generalization of the $p$-adic period conjecture of Yamashita for mixed Tate motives well-suited to applications in Chabauty--Kim theory.</description>

      <title>On generalized eigenvalues of MAX matrices to MIN matrices and of LCM matrices to GCD matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine, for any n $\ge$ 1, the generalized eigenvalues of an n x n MAX matrix to the corresponding MIN matrix. We also show that a similar result holds for the generalized eigenvalues of an nxn LCM matrix to the corresponding GCD matrix when n $\le$ 4, but breaks down for n &gt; 4. In addition, we prove Cauchy's interlacing theorem for generalized eigenvalues, and we conjecture an unexpected connection between the OEIS sequence A004754 and the appearance of -1 as a generalized eigenvalue in the LCM-GCD setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naciri proved that for any integer $k\geq2$, the Brocard--Ramanujan equation $n!+1=x^2$ has only finitely many integer solutions, assuming $x\pm1$ is a $k$-free integer or a prime power. In the present paper we prove similar statements for equations of the form $P(x)=\prod_{i=1}^rH_{n_i}$, where $P(x)$ is a polynomial and $H_{n_i}$ are divisible sequences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the sum and the alternating sum of the reciprocals of triangular numbers using two methods: a telescoping series approach and a power series approach. We then extend these results to generalized (higher-order) triangular numbers and obtain closed-form expressions for both the non-alternating and alternating series in all orders.</description>

      <title>Partial Hasse invariants for genus zero curves in Hilbert modular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct characteristic-zero lifts of partial Hasse invariants for genus zero non-compact curves in Hilbert modular varieties. The construction is based on recent results on the associated Picard-Fuchs differential equations. As an application, we relate the size of the non-ordinary locus of the modulo $p$ reduction of these curves to the dimension of spaces of (twisted) modular forms. We compute it explicitly for several Teichm\"uller curves, obtaining Deuring-like formulae. Moreover, we study the modulo $p$ reduction of (twisted) modular forms on not necessarily arithmetic genus-zero Fuchsian groups with modular embedding.</description>

      <title>Atkin polynomials for families of abelian varieties with real multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the work of Atkin and Kaneko-Zagier in the elliptic case, we describe the non-ordinary locus of a genus-zero non-compact curve $Y$ in a Hilbert modular variety in terms of the zeros of generalized Atkin's orthogonal polynomials. The argument relies on the recent construction of lifts of partial Hasse invariants for $Y$. We further describe these orthogonal polynomials as denominators of Pad\'e approximants to the logarithmic derivatives of solutions of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with $Y$. This provides a new link between Pad\'e approximation and the geometry of the non-ordinary locus, extending a classical observation of Igusa for the Legendre family and applying, in particular, to situations where the Picard-Fuchs equations do not admit modular solutions. As applications, we determine the three-term recurrence relations for Atkin polynomials attached to triangle curves via hypergeometric identities, and compute the supersingular locus of a double cover of the Teichm\"uller curve $W_{17}$. In the latter case, we conjecture that the associated supersingular polynomial is self-reciprocal, implying that supersingular points occur in pairs.</description>

      <title>Explicit Brauer-Manin obstructions on plane quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method to show a plane quartic over a number field has no rational points. The method can be adapted to show that a curve does not have divisors of degree 1 or 2 and can be generalized to arbitrary smooth projective curves. Our approach significantly improves on the applicability over previous 2-cover descent methods by not requiring the computation of the full $S$-unit group of the \'etale algebras involved. We illustrate the practicality with several examples, including examples where we determine plane quartics to be of index 2 or 4 when the maximum local index is strictly smaller.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorems for random isometries of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random walk $(Y_N)_{N\geq 0}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by successively applying independent random isometries, drawn from a fixed measure $\mu$, to the point $0$. When the support of $\mu$ is finite and includes an irrational rotation satisfying a Diophantine condition, we establish a local central limit theorem (LCLT) for $Y_N$ down to super-polynomially small scales. When $\mu$ includes rotations satisfying a further algebraic condition, we prove that a LCLT holds down to the scale $\exp(-cN^{1/3}/(\log N)^2)$. Due to group-theoretic obstructions, this is sharp for symmetric $\mu$, up to the $\log$ factor. Lastly for a special class of asymmetric $\mu$, we obtain an LCLT down to the much finer scale $\exp(-cN^{1/2})$. The proofs relate the fine-scale distribution of $Y_N$ to a question about the values of integer polynomials on the unit circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to compute the torsion component $\mathrm{Pic}^\tau X$ of the Picard scheme of a smooth projective variety $X$ over a field $k$. Specifically, we describe $\mathrm{Pic}^\tau X$ as a closed subscheme of a projective space defined by explicit homogeneous polynomials. Furthermore, we compute the group scheme structure on $\mathrm{Pic}^\tau X$. As applications, we provide algorithms to compute various homological invariants. Among these, we compute the abelianization of the geometric \'etale fundamental group $\pi^{\mathrm{{e}t}}_1(X_{\bar{k}}, x)^{\mathrm{ab}}$. Moreover, we determine the Galois module structure of the first \'etale cohomology groups $H^1_{\mathrm{{e}t}}(X_{\bar{k}}, \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ without requiring $n$ to be prime to the characteristic of $k$.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and S\'os studied the asymptotics of the maximum size of a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots, N\}$ such that it does not contain $k$ distinct elements whose product is a perfect square. More generally, Verstra\"ete proposed a conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of the same quantity with the set of perfect squares replaced by the value set of a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. In this paper, we study a finite field analogue of Verstra\"ete's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Low lying zeros of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the low lying zeros of $GL(2) \times GL(2)$ Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions. Assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, we compute the $1$-level density of the low-lying zeroes of $L(s, f \otimes g)$ averaged over families of Rankin-Selberg convolutions, where $f, g$ are cuspidal newforms with even weights $k_1, k_2$ and prime levels $N_1, N_2$, respectively. The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture predicts that in the limit, the $1$-level density of suitable families of $L$-functions is the same as the distribution of eigenvalues of corresponding families of random matrices. The 1-level density relies on a smooth test function $\phi$ whose Fourier transform $\widehat\phi$ has compact support. In general, we show the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture holds for test functions $\phi$ with $\operatorname{supp} \widehat\phi \subset (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$. When $N_1 = N_2$, we prove the density conjecture for $\operatorname{supp} \widehat\phi \subset (-\frac{5}{4}, \frac{5}{4})$ when $k_1 \ne k_2$, and $\operatorname{supp} \widehat\phi \subset (-\frac{29}{28}, \frac{29}{28})$ when $k_1 = k_2$. A lower order term emerges when the support of $\widehat\phi$ exceeds $(-1, 1)$, which makes these results particularly interesting. The main idea which allows us to extend the support of $\widehat\phi$ beyond $(-1, 1)$ is an analysis of the products of Kloosterman sums arising from the Petersson formula. We also carefully treat the contributions from poles in the case where $k_1 = k_2$. Our work provides conditional lower bounds for the proportion of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions which are non-vanishing at the central point and for a related conjecture of Keating and Snaith on central $L$-values.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections $\Omega^\bullet$ of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Using this description, we construct an explicit section in the derived category of (duals of) finite length admissible locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ to the canonical morphism of complexes $\Omega^\bullet \twoheadrightarrow H^{n-1}(\Omega^\bullet)[-(n-1)]$.</description>

      <title>Higher uniformity of arithmetic functions in short intervals II. Almost all intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher uniformity properties of the von Mangoldt function $\Lambda$, the M\"obius function $\mu$, and the divisor functions $d_k$ on short intervals $(x,x+H]$ for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$.
  Let $\Lambda^\sharp$ and $d_k^\sharp$ be suitable approximants of $\Lambda$ and $d_k$, $G/\Gamma$ a filtered nilmanifold, and $F\colon G/\Gamma \to \mathbb{C}$ a Lipschitz function. Then our results imply for instance that when $X^{1/3+\varepsilon} \leq H \leq X$ we have, for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$, \[ \sup_{g \in \text{Poly}(\mathbb{Z} \to G)} \left| \sum_{x &lt; n \leq x+H} (\Lambda(n)-\Lambda^\sharp(n)) \overline{F}(g(n)\Gamma) \right| \ll H\log^{-A} X \] for any fixed $A&gt;0$, and that when $X^{\varepsilon} \leq H \leq X$ we have, for almost all $x \in [X, 2X]$, \[ \sup_{g \in \text{Poly}(\mathbb{Z} \to G)} \left| \sum_{x &lt; n \leq x+H} (d_k(n)-d_k^\sharp(n)) \overline{F}(g(n)\Gamma) \right| = o(H \log^{k-1} X). \]
  As a consequence, we show that the short interval Gowers norms $\|\Lambda-\Lambda^\sharp\|_{U^s(X,X+H]}$ and $\|d_k-d_k^\sharp\|_{U^s(X,X+H]}$ are also asymptotically small for any fixed $s$ in the same ranges of $H$. This in turn allows us to establish the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture and the divisor correlation conjecture with a short average over one variable.
  Our main new ingredients are type $II$ estimates obtained by developing a "contagion lemma" for nilsequences and then using this to "scale up" an approximate functional equation for the nilsequence to a larger scale. This extends an approach developed by Walsh for Fourier uniformity.</description>

      <title>On Artin's conjecture on average and short character sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N_a(x)$ denote the number of primes up to $x$ for which the integer $a$ is a primitive root. We show that $N_a(x)$ satisfies the asymptotic predicted by Artin's conjecture for almost all $1\le a\le \exp((\log \log x)^2)$. This improves on a result of Stephens (1969). A key ingredient in the proof is a new short character sum estimate over the integers, improving on the range of a result of Garaev (2006).</description>

Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve and $p &gt; 2$ be a prime of good ordinary reduction for $E$. Assume that the residue representation associated with $(E, p)$ is irreducible. In this paper, we prove more cases on several Iwasawa main conjectures for $E$. As applications, we prove more general cases of $p$-converse theorem and $p$-part BSD formula when the rank is less than or equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>Intertwining periods, L-functions and local-global principles for distinction of automorphic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for non-vanishing of period integrals on automorphic representations of a general linear group over a division algebra. We consider three different periods: linear periods, twisted-linear periods and Galois periods. Our criterion is a local-global principle, which is stated in terms of local distinction, a further local obstruction, and poles of certain global L-functions associated to the underlying involution via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Our local-global principle follows from a new method, relying on the Maass-Selberg relations and a careful analysis of singularities of local and global intertwining periods. Our results generalize to inner forms, known results for split general linear groups. Moreover, our result for twisted linear periods is new even in the split situation. As a consequence of our local-global principle, we complete the proof of one direction of the Guo-Jacquet conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the Skolem problem for the $k$-generalized Pell sequence $(P_n^{(k)})_{n\geq2-k}$ extended to negative indices. We focus on identifying and bounding the indices $n&lt;0$ for which $P_n^{(k)}=0.$ In particular, we establish that the zero multiplicity of $P_n^{(k)}$ is $ \chi_k = \lfloor k^2/4\rfloor$ for all $k \in [4, 500].$</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, and let $\mathrm{X}$ be a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over $\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ where $K/\mathbf{Q}_p$ is a finite extension. We show that reflexive sheaves on the stack $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$ are equivalent to $\mathbf{Z}_p$-lattices in crystalline local systems on the rigid generic fiber $\mathrm{X}_\eta$, and then use this to study the essential image of the \'{e}tale realization functor on the isogeny category of perfect complexes on $\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}}$. We also show that when $\mathrm{X}/\mathrm{Spf} \mathcal{O}_K$ is smooth and proper that $\mathsf{Perf}(\mathrm{X}^{\mathrm{Syn}})[1/p]$ is equivalent to a category of admissible filtered $F$-isocrystals in perfect complexes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the values of the Riemann zeta function at odd integers and the Dirichlet beta function at even integers, by collecting several distinct analytic frameworks converging to these values, thus providing a unifying perspective. Beyond analytic interest, these formulas motivate linear independence conjectures which, if established, would imply the irrationality of the quantities $\zeta(2n + 1)/\pi^{2n+1}$ and $\beta(2n)/\pi^{2n}$</description>

Abstract: Let $E(X)$ denote the number of even integers below $X$ which are not a sum of two primes. We prove the bound $E(X)=O(X^{\frac{7}{10}})$, where the implicit constant is ineffective. The method applied here also leads to $P(q)=O(q^5)$, where $P(q)$ denotes the least prime, if it exists, in any arithmetic progression modulo $q$.</description>

      <title>Visibility of Lattice Points across Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visibility of lattice points from the origin along a polynomial family of curves constitutes a significant generalization of visibility along straight lines. Following the classical notion, where the density equals 1/2, and its generalization to monomial curves of the form y = a x^b, where the density equals 1/(b+1), we study a family of polynomial curves defined by y = q(a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x), where q is a positive rational number.
  We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family.
  Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points. This work provides a broader theoretical foundation for lattice point visibility beyond linear and monomial settings.</description>

Abstract: We extend Moonen's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of smooth curves in terms of Hasse-Witt triples to all stable curves and show that it matches Ekedahl and van der Geer's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of their generalized Jacobians as semi-abelian varieties. Using this intrinsic insight, we can compute the dimensions of certain Ekedahl-Oort loci of curves and generalize some previously known results about the dimensions of the $p$-rank and $a$-number loci of curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that on a $\sigma$-finite measure preserving system $X = (X,\nu, T)$, the non-conventional ergodic averages $$ \mathbb{E}_{n \in [N]} \Lambda(n) f(T^n x) g(T^{P(n)} x)$$ converge pointwise almost everywhere for $f \in L^{p_1}(X)$, $g \in L^{p_2}(X)$, and $1/p_1 + 1/p_2 \leq 1$, where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree at least $2$. This had previously been established with the von Mangoldt weight $\Lambda$ replaced by the constant weight $1$ by the first and third authors with Mirek, and by the M\"obius weight $\mu$ by the fourth author. The proof is based on combining tools from both of these papers, together with several Gowers norm and polynomial averaging operator estimates on approximants to the von Mangoldt function of ''Cram\'er'' and ''Heath-Brown'' type.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-adic Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of smooth supersingular curves of genus $5$ in characteristic $2$ with several notable features: its dimension matches the expected dimension of any component of the supersingular locus in genus $5$, its members are non-hyperelliptic curves with non-trivial automorphism groups, and each curve in the family admits a double cover structure over both an elliptic curve and a genus-$2$ curve. We also provide an explicit parametrization of this family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of B\"uchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</description>
