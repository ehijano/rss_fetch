      <title>Residual finiteness of some automorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a smooth, closed 2-connected manifold $M$ of dimension $d \geq 6$, the topological mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is residually finite, in contrast to the situation for the smooth mapping class group $\pi_0 \mathrm{Diff}(M)$. Combined with a result of Sullivan, this implies that $\pi_0 \mathrm{Homeo}(M)$ is an arithmetic group. The proof uses embedding calculus, and is of independent interest: we show that the $T_k$-mapping class group, $\pi_0 T_k \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, is residually finite, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. The statement on the topological mapping class group is then deduced from the Weiss fibre sequence, convergence of the embedding calculus tower and smoothing theory.</description>

      <title>Slice genus, $T$-genus and $4$-dimensional clasp number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $T$-genus of a knot is the minimal number of borromean-type triple points on a normal singular disk with no clasp bounded by the knot; it is an upper bound for the slice genus. Kawauchi, Shibuya and Suzuki characterized the slice knots by the vanishing of their $T$-genus. We generalize this to provide a $3$-dimensional characterization of the slice genus. Further, we prove that the $T$-genus majors the $4$-dimensional positive clasp number and we deduce that the difference between the $T$-genus and the slice genus can be arbitrarily large. We introduce the ribbon counterpart of the $T$-genus and prove that it is an upper bound for the ribbon genus. Interpreting the $T$-genera in terms of $\Delta$-distance, we show that the $T$-genus and the ribbon $T$-genus coincide for all knots if and only if all slice knots are ribbon. We work in the more general setting of algebraically split links and we also discuss the case of colored links. Finally, we express Milnor's triple linking number of an algebraically split $3$-component link as the algebraic intersection number of three immersed disks bounded by the three components.</description>

      <title>Positive surface group representations in PO(p,q)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that $\Theta$-positive Anosov representations $\rho:\Gamma\to{\sf PO}(p,q)$ of a surface group $\Gamma$ satisfy root versus weight collar lemmas for all the Anosov roots, and are positively ratioed with respect to all such roots. We deduce from this, using a result of Beyrer-Pozzetti (2024), that $\Theta$-positive Anosov representations $\rho:\Gamma\to{\sf PO}(p,q)$ form connected components of character varieties.</description>

      <title>Pants complex, TQFT and hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a coarse perspective on relations of the $SU(2)$-Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT, the Weil-Petersson geometry of the Teichm\"uller space, and volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Using data from the asymptotic expansions of the curve operators in the skein theoretic version of the $SU(2)$-TQFT, we define the quantum intersection number between pants decompositions of a closed surface. We show that the quantum intersection number admits two sided bounds in terms of the geometric intersection number and we use it to obtain a metric on the pants graph of surfaces. Using work of Brock we show that the pants graph equipped with this metric is quasi-isometric to the Teichm\"uller space with the Weil-Petersson metric and that the translation length of our metric provides two sided linear bounds on the volume of hyperbolic fibered manifolds. We briefly discuss how these relations are interpeted from the view point of $SU(2)$-character varieties of 3-manifolds.
  We also obtain a characterization of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes in terms of asymptotics of the quantum intersection number under iteration in the mapping class group and relate these asymptotics with stretch factors. We also discuss how these results fit with a conjecture of Andersen, Masbaum and Ueno about quantum representations of mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Earthquake theorem for cluster algebras of finite type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster algebraic generalization of Thurston's earthquake map for the cluster algebras of finite type, which we call the \emph{cluster earthquake map}. It is defined by gluing exponential maps, which is modeled after the earthquakes along ideal arcs. We prove an analogue of the earthquake theorem, which states that the cluster earthquake map gives a homeomorphism between the spaces of $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{trop}$- and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued points of the cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety. For those of type $A_n$ and $D_n$, the cluster earthquake map indeed recovers the earthquake maps for marked disks and once-punctured marked disks, respectively. Moreover, we investigate certain asymptotic behaviors of the cluster earthquake map, which give rise to "continuous deformations" of the Fock--Goncharov fan.</description>

      <title>Multisections of surface bundles and bundles over the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multisection is a decomposition of a manifold into 1-handlebodies, where each subcollection of the pieces intersects along a 1-handlebody except the global intersection which is a closed surface. These generalizations of Heegaard splittings and Gay-Kirby trisections were introduced by Ben Aribi, Courte, Golla and the author, who proved in particular that any 5-manifold admits such a multisection. In arbitrary dimension, we show that two classes of manifolds admit multisections: surface bundles and fiber bundles over the circle whose fiber itself is multisected. We provide explicit constructions, with examples.</description>

      <title>Recalibrating $\mathbb{R}$-order trees and $\mbox{Homeo}_+(S^1)$-representations of link groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the left-orderability of $3$-manifold groups using an enhancement, called recalibration, of Calegari and Dunfield's "flipping" construction, used for modifying $\mbox{Homeo}_+(S^1)$-representations of the fundamental groups of closed $3$-manifolds. The added flexibility accorded by recalibration allows us to produce $\mbox{Homeo}_+(S^1)$-representations of hyperbolic link exteriors so that a chosen element in the peripheral subgroup is sent to any given rational rotation. We apply these representations to show that the branched covers of families of links associated to arbitrary epimorphisms of the link group onto a finite cyclic group are left-orderable. This applies, for instance, to fibered hyperbolic strongly quasipositive links. Our result on the orderability of branched covers implies that the degeneracy locus of any pseudo-Anosov flow on an alternating knot complement must be meridional, which generalizes the known result that the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of any hyperbolic fibered alternating knot is zero. Applications of these representations to order-detection of slopes are also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks as the Semi-classical Limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks: The problem of generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks miss a principled model of their operation. A novel framework for supervised learning based on Topological Quantum Field Theory that looks particularly well suited for implementation on quantum processors has been recently explored. We propose using this framework to understand the problem of generalisation in Deep Neural Networks. More specifically, in this approach, Deep Neural Networks are viewed as the semi-classical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. A framework of this kind explains the overfitting behavior of Deep Neural Networks during the training step and the corresponding generalisation capabilities. We explore the paradigmatic case of the perceptron, which we implement as the semiclassical limit of Topological Quantum Neural Networks. We apply a novel algorithm we developed, showing that it obtains similar results to standard neural networks, but without the need for training (optimisation).</description>

      <title>Metrics of Positive Ricci Curvature on Simply-Connected Manifolds of Dimension $6k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consequence of the surgery theorem of Gromov and Lawson is that every closed, simply-connected 6-manifold admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. For metrics of positive Ricci curvature it is widely open whether a similar result holds; there are no obstructions known for those manifolds to admit a metric of positive Ricci curvature, while the number of examples known is limited. In this article we introduce a new description of certain $6k$-dimensional manifolds via labeled bipartite graphs and use an earlier result of the author to construct metrics of positive Ricci curvature on these manifolds. In this way we obtain many new examples, both spin and non-spin, of $6k$-dimensional manifolds with a metric of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

      <title>$f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes, flag spheres, and geometric Lefschetz decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there are $f$-vectors of balanced simplicial complexes giving a source of simplicial complexes exhibiting a Boolean decomposition similar to a geometric Lefschetz decomposition. The objects we are working with are $h$-vectors of flag spheres and balanced simplicial complexes whose $f$-vectors are equal to them. This builds on work of Nevo--Petersen--Tenner on a conjecture of Nevo--Petersen that the gamma vector of an odd-dimensional flag sphere is the $f$-vector of a balanced simplicial complex (which was shown for barycentric subdivisions by Nevo--Petersen--Tenner). We can connect our decomposition to positivity questions on reciprocal/palindromic polynomials associated to flag spheres and geometric questions motivating them. In addition, we note that the degrees in the Lefschetz-like decomposition are not halved unlike the usual $h$-vector setting.</description>
