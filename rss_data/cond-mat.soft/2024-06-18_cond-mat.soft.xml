      <title>Relaxation of particle-laden interfaces: geometric and preparation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of uni-axially compressed particle rafts through a finite opening found at the opposite side is experimentally studied. Three main behaviours are identified. The lowest relaxation degree corresponds to local unjamming. The other extreme corresponds to full relaxation and is characterized by the unjamming of the entire raft. In between, intermediate relaxation is observed. The unjammed domain first grows along the compression direction with an almost constant width and possibly extends through the entire raft length. In this case, a second phase may start during which erosion enables the unjammed channel to develop normally to the compression direction. Employing different raft geometries, i.e. various length and compression levels, and openings of various widths, we rationalize the occurrence of these different behaviours, which we attribute to the mechanical robustness of the force chain network. The threshold for channel formation and erosion are interpreted as its rupture against excessive shear and elongation, respectively. By further comparing results obtained for rafts prepared according to three different mixing degrees, we evidence that these thresholds are strongly affected by the raft history and quantify these effects in terms of shift of the rupture limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern 3D printers allow for the accurate placing of microscopic material voxels, to form complex three-dimensional structures. The advancing capabilities in multi-material printing, coupled with the discovery of printable responsive materials, pave the way for the 3D printing of digital materials, and for the 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. In this work, we leverage and combine these advancements to develop a versatile methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print digital responsive sheets, composed of active and passive voxels that are meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. This methodology enables us to encode the lateral geometry and the reference curvature, separately and simultaneously. Our approach grants us comprehensive control over the resulting shape, unlocking novel opportunities in synthetic shape-morphing materials. Furthermore, it has the potential to program anomalous mechanical properties and to be extended to multi-material and metamaterial systems.</description>

      <title>On the analysis of two-time correlation functions: equilibrium vs non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) is a powerful tool for the investigation of dynamics covering a broad range of time and length scales. The two-time correlation function (TTC) is commonly used to track non-equilibrium dynamical evolution in XPCS measurements, followed by the extraction of one-time correlations. While the theoretical foundation for the quantitative analysis of TTCs is primarily established for equilibrium systems, where key parameters such as diffusion remain constant, non-equilibrium systems pose a unique challenge. In such systems, different projections ("cuts") of the TTC may lead to divergent results if the underlying fundamental parameters themselves are subject to temporal variations. This article explores widely used approaches for TTC calculations and common methods for extracting relevant information from correlation functions on case studies, particularly in the light of comparing dynamics in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Wind-Driven Interfacial Evaporation from Cold Water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial evaporation, utilizing renewable energy, presents a sustainable approach to promote fast water evaporation with applications in wastewater treatment, soil remediation, and seawater desalination. Solar energy is typically considered a sustainable and stable resource for interfacial evaporation. However, in the cold climate and high-latitude regions, it is challenging how to speed up evaporation of ice-water mixtures. Harnessing wind energy for water evaporation under low-temperature conditions offers considerable potential for addressing wastewater treatment challenges in these areas. In this study, an interfacial evaporation system was designed to harness wind energy for enhanced evaporation from an icy cold water source. A classic oil-lamp evaporator and a new sailboat were used to reveal the influence of wind speed on water evaporation from pure water, and water covered with an oil layer in both lab-scale batch experiments and outdoor trials. The evaporation rate was increased by 6 to 75 times by wind. Our experimental results show that when wind speed exceeds 2.4 m/s, the evaporation rate of water under 1 sun irradiation is comparable to that in dark at the same wind speed at an ambient temperature of 20 $^\circ$C. Our findings demonstrate that a substantial increase in water evaporation rate from solar radiation in weak wind. With an evaporation surface area of 4750 cm$^2$, a high water evaporation rate was maintained at 1.2 kg m$^{-2}$h$^{-1}$, an order of magnitude faster than natural evaporation. A simple theoretical model was developed to correlate the evaporation rate with wind velocity and clarify the diminishing impact of solar irradiation at high wind speeds. The insights gained from this study may contribute to the development of a clean, sustainable approach for reducing wastewater volume in high latitude areas.</description>

      <title>Rheological Analysis and Evaluation of Measurement Techniques for the Curing Polymethylmethacrylate Bone Cement in Vertebroplasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat vertebral fractures, which conventionally involves injecting polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement into the fractured vertebra. A common risk associated with vertebroplasty is cement leaking out of the vertebra during the injection, which may occur due to a lack of understanding of the bone cement's complex flow behavior. Therefore, experiments to quantify the cement's flow properties are necessary for understanding and proper handling of the bone cement. In this study, we aimed to characterize the behavior of the PMMA bone cement in its curing stages to obtain parameters that govern the flow behavior during the injection. We used rotational and oscillatory rheometry for our measurements, as well as a custom-made injector setup that replicated a typical vertebroplasty setting. Our results showed that the complex viscoelastic behavior of the bone cement is significantly affected by deformations and temperature. We found that the results from rotational tests, often used for characterizing the bone cement, are susceptible to measurement artifacts caused by wall slip and "ridge"-like formations in the test sample. We also found the Cox-Merz rule to be conditionally valid, which affects the use of oscillatory tests to obtain shear-thinning characteristics for the bone cement. Our findings identify important differences in the measured flow behavior of PMMA bone cement when assessed by different rheological methods, understanding which is crucial for its risk-free usage in downstream medical applications.</description>

      <title>Gaseous Diffusion as a Correlated Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean square displacement per collision of a molecule immersed in a gas at equilibrium is given by its mean square displacement between two consecutive collisions (mean square free path) corrected by a prefactor in the form of a series. The $n$-th term of the series is proportional to the mean value of the scalar product $\rb_1 \cdot \rb_{n}$, where $\rb_i$ is the displacement of the molecule between the $(i-1)$-th and $i$-th collisions. Simple arguments are used to obtain approximate expressions for each term. The key finding is that the ratio of consecutive terms in the series closely approximates the so-called mean persistence ratio. Exact expressions for the terms in the series are considered and their ratios for several consecutive terms are calculated for the case of hard spheres, showing an excellent agreement with the mean persistence ratio. These theoretical results are confirmed by solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. By summing the series, the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient can be determined using only two quantities: the mean square free path and the mean persistence ratio. A simple and an improved expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ are considered and compared with the so-called first and second Sonine approximations to $D$ as well as with computer simulations of the Boltzmann equation. It is found that the improved diffusion coefficient shows very good agreement with simulation results over all intruder and molecule mass ranges. When the intruder mass is smaller than that of the gas molecules, the improved formula even outperforms the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>pyMBE: the Python-based Molecule Builder for ESPResSo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Python-based Molecule Builder for ESPResSo (pyMBE), an open source software to design custom Coarse-Grained (CG) models, as well as pre-defined models of polyelectrolytes, peptides and globular proteins in the Extensible Simulation Package for Research on Soft Matter (ESPResSo). The Python interface of \espresso offers a flexible framework, capable of building custom CG models from scratch. As a downside, building CG models from scratch is error-prone, especially for newcomers in the field of CG modeling, or for molecules with complex architectures. The pyMBE module builds CG models in \espresso using a hierarchical bottom-up approach, providing a robust tool to automate the setup of CG models and helping new users prevent common mistakes. ESPResSo features the constant pH (cpH) and grand-reaction (G-RxMC) methods, which have been designed to study chemical reaction equilibria in macromolecular systems with many reactive species. However, setting up these methods for systems which contain several types of reactive groups is an error-prone task, especially for beginners. The pyMBE module enables the automatic setup of cpH and G-RxMC simulations in \espresso, lowering the barrier for newcomers and opening the door to investigate complex systems not studied with these methods yet. To demonstrate some of the applications of pyMBE, we showcase several case studies where we successfully reproduce previously published simulations of charge-regulating peptides and globular proteins in bulk solution and weak polyelectrolytes in dialysis. The pyMBE module is publicly available as a GitHub repository (https://github.com/pyMBE-dev/pyMBE) which includes its source code and various sample and test scripts, including the ones that we used to generate the data presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Approach and rotation of reconnecting topological defect lines in liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects are a universal concept across many disciplines, such as crystallography, liquid-crystalline physics, low-temperature physics, cosmology, and even biology. In nematic liquid crystals, topological defects called disclinations have been widely studied. For their three-dimensional (3D) dynamics, however, only recently have theoretical approaches dealing with fully 3D configurations been reported. Further, recent experiments have observed 3D disclination line reconnections, a phenomenon characteristic of defect line dynamics, but detailed discussions were limited to the case of approximately parallel defects. In this study, we focus on the case of two disclination lines that approach at finite angles and lie in separate planes, a more fundamentally 3D reconnection configuration. Observing and analyzing such reconnection events, we find the square-root law of the distance between disclinations and the decrease of the inter-disclination angle over time. We compare the experimental results with theory and find qualitative agreement on the scaling of distance and angle with time, but quantitative disagreement on distance and angle relative mobilities. To probe this disagreement, we derive the equations of motion for systems with reduced twist constant and also carry out simulations for this case. These, together with the experimental results, suggest that deformations of disclinations may be responsible for the disagreement.</description>

      <title>Effect of annealed disorder on the plasticity of amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of annealed disorder on the mechanical properties and plasticity of a modeled amorphous solid by introducing a small fraction of heavy impurities into the material which resembles real experimental systems. The disorder being mobile, the total degrees of freedom and the potential energy landscape of the pure system are preserved in our model. The mechanical failure and the shear band formation in the amorphous solid in the presence of annealed disorder are studied at the microscopic level by employing the finite shear deformation protocol at nonzero temperature. A significant enhancement in the shear modulus and yield stress is observed as a function of the heaviness of the impurity particles. Via the analysis of the non-affine displacement field and the microscopic strain fluctuations and the nature of their spatial correlations we find that the shear band formation in the plastic regime is gradually suppressed with increasing impurity mass. Eventually, a critical mass of the disordered particles is identified above which the plastic events become completely localized. This is marked by a transition from a power law to an exponential decay in the spatial correlations non-affine displacement field. Likewise, a similar change is observed in the strain correlation function, transitioning from a slower $1/r$ decay to a more rapid $1/r^3$ decay. Finally, the effect shear rate on the plastic events in the presence of annealed disorder is explored.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the dynamic slowdown in supercooled water: The role of dynamic disorder in jump motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a liquid is rapidly cooled below its melting point without inducing crystallization, its dynamics slow down significantly without noticeable structural changes. Elucidating the origin of this slowdown has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we report a theoretical investigation into the mechanism of the dynamic slowdown in supercooled water, a ubiquitous yet extraordinary substance characterized by various anomalous properties arising from local density fluctuations. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the jump dynamics, which are elementary structural change processes, deviate from Poisson statistics with decreasing temperature. This deviation is attributed to slow variables competing with the jump motions, i.e., dynamic disorder. The present analysis of the dynamic disorder showed that the primary slow variable is the displacement of the fourth nearest oxygen atom of a jumping molecule, which occurs in an environment created by the fluctuations of molecules outside the first hydration shell. As the temperature decreases, the jump dynamics become slow and intermittent. These intermittent dynamics are attributed to the prolonged trapping of jumping molecules within extended and stable low-density domains. As the temperature continues to decrease, the number of slow variables increases due to the increased cooperative motions. Consequently, the jump dynamics proceed in a higher-dimensional space consisting of multiple slow variables, becoming slower and more intermittent. It is then conceivable that with further decreasing temperature, the slowing and intermittency of the jump dynamics intensify, eventually culminating in a glass transition.</description>

      <title>Field-dependent magnetic relaxation times of magnetic nanoparticle systems: analytic approximations supported by numerical simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many estimates for the magnetic relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticle systems neglect the effect of the applied field strength. This is despite many applications of magnetic nanoparticles involving relaxation dynamics under the influence of applied fields. Here, an analytic approximation for the field-dependent Brownian relaxation time of single-domain, spherical magnetic nanoparticles in an external applied field is developed mathematically. This expression is validated by comparison with existing empirically-derived expressions and by comparison to particle-level simulations that allow particle rotations. Our approximation works particularly well for larger particles. We then use the developed expression to analytically calculate the total magnetic relaxation time when both Brownian and N\'eel relaxation mechanisms are at play. Again, we show that the results match those found using particle-level simulations, this time with both particle rotations and internal magnetization dynamics allowed. However, for some particle parameters and for large field strengths, our simulations reveal that the Brownian and N\'eel relaxation mechanisms are decoupled and it is not appropriate to combine these to calculate a total relaxation time.</description>
