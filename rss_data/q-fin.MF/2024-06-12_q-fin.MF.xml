      <title>Convex ordering for stochastic control: the swing contracts case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate propagation of convexity and convex ordering on a typical stochastic optimal control problem, namely the pricing of \q{\emph{Take-or-Pay}} swing option, a financial derivative product commonly traded on energy markets. The dynamics of the underlying asset is modelled by an \emph{ARCH} model with convex coefficients. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying \emph{ARCH} coefficients. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein's formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the \emph{ARCH} coefficients can be relaxed with a semi-convexity assumption. To validate the results presented in this paper, we also conduct numerical illustrations.</description>

      <title>From rank-based models with common noise to pathwise entropy solutions of SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mean field limit of a rank-based model with common noise, which arises as an extension to models for the market capitalization of firms in stochastic portfolio theory. We show that, under certain conditions on the drift and diffusion coefficients, the empirical cumulative distribution function converges to the solution of a stochastic PDE. A key step in the proof, which is of independent interest, is to show that any solution to an associated martingale problem is also a pathwise entropy solution to the stochastic PDE, a notion introduced in a recent series of papers [32, 33, 19, 16, 17].</description>

      <title>Change of numeraire for weak martingale transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Change of numeraire is a classical tool in mathematical finance. Campi-Laachir-Martini established its applicability to martingale optimal transport. We note that the results of Campi-Laachir-Martini extend to the case of weak martingale transport. We apply this to shadow couplings, continuous time martingale transport problems in the framework of Huesmann-Trevisan and in particular to establish the correspondence between stretched Brownian motion with its geometric counterpart.
  Note: We emphasize that we learned about the geometric stretched Brownian motion gSBM (defined in PDE terms) in a presentation of Loeper \cite{Lo23} before our work on this topic started. We noticed that a change of numeraire transformation in the spirit of \cite{CaLaMa14} allows for an alternative viewpoint in the weak optimal transport framework. We make our work public following the publication of Backhoff-Loeper-Obloj's work \cite{BaLoOb24} on arxiv.org. The article \cite{BaLoOb24} derives gSBM using PDE techniques as well as through an independent probabilistic approach which is close to the one we give in the present article.</description>
