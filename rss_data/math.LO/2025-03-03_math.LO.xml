      <title>A model of the Axiom of Determinacy in which every set of reals is universally Baire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consistency of the theory $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}} + {}$``every set of reals is universally Baire'' is proved relative to $\mathsf{ZFC} + {}$``there is a cardinal that is a limit of Woodin cardinals and of strong cardinals.'' The proof is based on the derived model construction, which was used by Woodin to show that the theory $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}} + {}$``every set of reals is Suslin'' is consistent relative to $\mathsf{ZFC} + {}$``there is a cardinal $\lambda$ that is a limit of Woodin cardinals and of $\mathord{&lt;}\lambda$-strong cardinals.'' The $\Sigma^2_1$ reflection property of our model is proved using genericity iterations as used by Neeman and Steel.</description>

      <title>Abelian congruences and similarity in varieties with a weak difference term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of three papers motivated by the author's desire to understand and explain "algebraically" one aspect of Dmitriy Zhuk's proof of the CSP Dichotomy Theorem. In this paper we study abelian congruences in varieties having a weak difference term. Each class of the congruence supports an abelian group structure; if the congruence is minimal, each class supports the structure of a vector space over a division ring determined by the congruence. A construction due to J. Hagemann, C. Herrmann and R. Freese in the congruence modular setting extends to varieties with a weak difference term, and provides a "universal domain" for the abelian groups or vector spaces that arise from the classes of the congruence within a single class of the annihilator of the congruence. The construction also supports an extension of Freese's similarity relation (between subdirectly irreducible algebras) from the congruence modular setting to varieties with a weak difference term.</description>

      <title>Terminating Hybrid Tableaus for Ordered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid logic extends modal logic with special propositions called nominals, each of which is true at only one state in a model. This enables us to describe some properties of binary relations, such as irreflexivity and anti-symmetry, which are essential to treat partial orders. We present terminating tableau calculi complete with respect to models whose accessibility relations are strictly partially ordered, unbounded strictly partially ordered, and partially ordered.</description>

      <title>A note on uniform continuity of monotone functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that it is consistent with ZFC that for every non-decreasing function $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]$, each subset of $[0,1]$ of cardinality $\mathfrak c$ contains a set of cardinality $\mathfrak c$ on which $f$ is uniformly continuous. We show that this statement follows from the assumptions that $\mathfrak d^* &lt; \mathfrak c$ and $\mathfrak c$ is regular, where $\mathfrak d^*\leq \mathfrak d$ is the smallest cardinality $\kappa$ such that any two disjoint countable dense sets in the Cantor set can be separated by sets each of which is an intersection of at most $\kappa$-many open sets in the Cantor set. We establish also that $\mathfrak d^*=\min\{\mathfrak u, \mathfrak d\}=\min\{\mathfrak r, \mathfrak d\}$, thus giving an alternative proof of the latter equality established by J. Aubrey in 2004.</description>

      <title>Duality Theory for Bounded Lattices: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are numerous generalizations of the celebrated Priestley duality for bounded distributive lattices to the non-distributive setting. The resulting dualities rely on an earlier foundational work of such authors as Nachbin, Birkhoff-Frink, Bruns-Lakser, Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka, and others. We undertake a detailed comparative study of the existing dualities for arbitrary bounded (non-distributive) lattices, including supplying the dual description of bounded lattice homomorphisms where it was lacking. This is achieved by working with relations instead of functions. As a result, we arrive at a landscape of categories that provide various generalizations of the category of Priestley spaces. We provide explicit descriptions of the functors yielding equivalences of these categories, together with explicit equivalences with the category of bounded lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of evaluations without unanimity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dokow and Holzman determined which predicates over $\{0, 1\}$ satisfy an analog of Arrow's theorem: all unanimous aggregators are dictatorial. Szegedy and Xu, extending earlier work of Dokow and Holzman, extended this to predicates over arbitrary finite alphabets.
  Mossel extended Arrow's theorem in an orthogonal direction, determining all aggregators without the assumption of unanimity. We bring together both threads of research by extending the results of Dokow-Holzman and Szegedy-Xu to the setting of Mossel. As an application, we determine which symmetric predicates over $\{0,1\}$ are such that all aggregators are dictatorial.</description>

      <title>Domains, Information Frames, Rough Sets: An Equivalence of Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalization of Scott's information systems~\cite{sco82} is presented that captures exactly all continuous domains. The global consistency predicate in Scott's definition is relativized. Now, for every atomic statement, there is a consistency predicate that states which finite sets of statements express information that is consistent with the given statement. The category of information frames is shown to be equivalent to the category of domains. Moreover, the relationship with CF-approximation spaces introduced by Wu and Xu~\cite{wx23} is studied. The corresponding category is also shown to be equivalent with the category of information frames. This research achieves a refinement of the equivalence result of Wu and Xu of the category of CF-approximation spaces with the category of domains.</description>

      <title>Conditional algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on the classic paper by Chellas "Basic conditional logic" (1975), we propose a general algebraic framework for studying a binary operation of conditional that models universal features of the "if..., then..." connective as strictly related to the unary modal necessity operator. To this end, we introduce a variety of conditional algebras, and we develop its duality and canonical extensions theory.</description>

      <title>Formal conjugacy and asymptotic differential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy of formal derivations on fields of generalised power series in characteristic 0. Casting the problem of Poincar\'e resonance in terms of asymptotic differential algebra, we give conditions for conjugacy of parabolic flat log-exp transseries, flat grid-based transseries, logarithmic transseries, power series with exponents and coefficients in an ordered field, and formal Puiseux series.</description>
