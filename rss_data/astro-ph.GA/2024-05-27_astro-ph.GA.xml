      <title>Trojan globular clusters: radial migration via trapping in bar resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for globular clusters (GCs) trapped in resonances with the bar of the Milky Way. By integrating their orbits in a potential with a decelerating bar, we select 10 whose orbits are significantly changed by its presence. Most of these are trapped in the corotation resonance (CR), including M22 and 47 Tuc. The decelerating bar is capable of transporting these GCs to their current positions from much lower energies, angular momenta, and radii. Our results indicate that the bar is likely to have reshaped the Milky Way's globular cluster system via its resonances. We also discuss implications for the origins of specific GCs, including the possible nuclear star cluster M22. Finally, we consider the effects of the bar on the tidal tails of a trapped GC, by running simulations of stars stripped from 47 Tuc. Instead of forming narrow tails, the stripped stars make up a diffuse extended halo around the cluster, consistent with observations of 47 Tuc.</description>

      <title>The Supersonic Project: Early Star Formation with the Streaming Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim12$), the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter (the so-called streaming velocity) significantly affects star formation in low-mass objects. Streaming substantially reduces the abundance of low-mass gas objects while simultaneously allowing for the formation of supersonically-induced gas objects (SIGOs) and their associated star clusters outside of dark matter halos. Here, we present a study of the population-level effects of streaming on star formation within both halos and SIGOs in a set of simulations with and without streaming. Notably, we find that streaming actually enhances star formation within individual halos of all masses at redshifts between $z=12$ and $z=20$. This is demonstrated both as an increased star formation rate per object as well as an enhancement of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for objects with streaming. We find that our simulations are consistent with some observations at high redshift, but on a population level, they continue to under-predict star formation relative to the majority of observations. However, simulations of overdense regions (both with and without streaming) agree with observations, suggesting a strategy for extracting information about the overdensity and streaming velocity in a given survey volume in future observations.</description>

      <title>SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): A Glimpse into Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Orion Molecular Cloud complex, one of the nearest (D~400 pc) and most extensively studied massive star-forming regions, is ideal for constraining the physics of stellar feedback, but its ~12 deg diameter on the sky requires a dedicated approach to mapping ionized gas structures within and around the nebula. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a new optical integral field unit (IFU) that will map the ionized gas within the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, covering 4300 deg^2 of the sky with the new LVM Instrument (LVM-I). We showcase optical emission line maps from LVM covering 12 deg^2 inside of the Orion belt region, with 195,000 individual spectra combined to produce images at 0.07 pc (35.3 arcsec) resolution. This is the largest IFU map made (to date) of the Milky Way, and contains well-known nebulae (the Horsehead Nebula, Flame Nebula, IC 434, and IC 432), as well as ionized interfaces with the neighboring dense Orion B molecular cloud. We resolve the ionization structure of each nebula, and map the increase in both the [SII]/Ha and [NII]/Ha line ratios at the outskirts of nebulae and along the ionization front with Orion B. [OIII] line emission is only spatially resolved within the center of the Flame Nebula and IC 434, and our ~0.1 pc scale line ratio diagrams show how variations in these diagnostics are lost as we move from the resolved to the integrated view of each nebula. We detect ionized gas emission associated with the dusty bow wave driven ahead of the star sigma Orionis, where the stellar wind interacts with the ambient interstellar medium. The Horsehead Nebula is seen as a dark occlusion of the bright surrounding photo-disassociation region. This small glimpse into Orion only hints at the rich science that will be enabled by the LVM.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Re-Mapping the close-by galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the local repulsion force caused by the expansion of the Universe. This research extends the definition of zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions for different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations for Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups viralization. With these definitions, we indicate the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. The results show that it is important to include the cosmological constant in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Properties of Nuclear Star Clusters in Low Surface Brightness Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the SMUDGes and SDSS catalogs, and our own reprocessing of the Legacy Surveys imaging, we investigate the properties of nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in galaxies having central surface brightnesses as low as 27 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We identify 273 (123 with known redshift) and 32 NSC-bearing galaxies in the two samples, respectively, where we require candidate NSCs to have a separation of less than 0.10$r_e$ from the galaxy center. We find that galaxies with low central surface brightness ($\mu_{0,g} &gt; 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) are more likely to contain an NSC if 1) they have a higher stellar mass, 2) a higher stellar to total mass ratio, 3) a brighter central surface brightness, 4) a larger axis ratio, or 5) lie in a denser environment. Because of the correlations among these various quantities, it is likely that only one or two are true physical drivers. We also find scaling relations for the NSC mass with stellar mass ($M_{NSC}/$\Msol$ = 10^{6.02\pm0.03}(M_{*,gal}/10^{8} $\Msol$)^{0.77\pm0.04}$) and halo mass ($M_{NSC}/$\Msol$ = 10^{6.11\pm0.05}(M_{h,gal}/10^{10} $\Msol$)^{0.92\pm0.05}$), although it is the scaling with halo mass that is consistent with a direct proportionality. In galaxies with an NSC, $M_{NSC} \approx 10^{-4}M_{h,gal}$. This proportionality echoes the finding of a direct proportionality between the mass (or number) of globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies and the galaxy's total mass. These findings favor a related origin for GCs and NSCs.</description>

      <title>Active Galactic Nuclei and Host Galaxies in COSMOS-Web. II. First Look at the Kpc-scale Dual and Offset AGN Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kpc-scale dual and offset Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are signposts of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) triggered during late-stage galaxy mergers, offering crucial insights into the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies. However, robustly confirmed systems at high redshift (e.g., $z&gt;1$) are scarce and biased towards the most luminous and unobscured systems. In this study, we systematically search for kpc-scale (projected separation $&lt;15$ kpc) dual and offset AGNs around 571 moderate-luminosity, X-ray-selected AGNs including the obscured population, utilizing deep HST ACS/F814W and multiband JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. We identify 59 dual and 30 offset AGN candidates in late stage major mergers based on spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution analyses. This translates to $\sim28$ and $\sim10$ bona-fide dual and offset AGNs using a probabilistic pair counting scheme to minimize chance superpositions. Notably, the fraction of dual and offset AGNs among moderate-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{43}-10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$), obscured AGNs is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous, unobscured quasar pairs. We find tentative evidence for an increasing pair fraction among AGNs with redshift (from a few percent at $z\sim 0.5$ to $\sim22.9_{-17.7}^{+27.5}\%$ at $z\sim4.5$) and a higher occurrence rate of dual over offset AGNs. There is no pileup of dual/offset AGNs below $\sim 2~{\rm kpc}$ separations. These results generally align with predictions from the ASTRID and Horizon-AGN cosmological simulations when matching sample selection criteria, implying a high probability of both BHs being active simultaneously in late-stage major mergers.</description>

      <title>Impact of Turbulent Magnetic Fields on Disk Formation and Fragmentation in First Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have suggested that the first stars in the universe often form as binary or multiple systems. However, previous studies typically overlooked the potential influence of magnetic fields during this process, assuming them to be weak and minimally impactful. Emerging theoretical investigations, however, propose an alternative perspective, suggesting that turbulent dynamo effects within first-star forming clouds can generate strong magnetic fields. In this study, we perform three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations, starting from the gravitational collapse of a turbulent cloud core to the early accretion phase, where disk fragmentation frequently occurs. Our findings reveal that turbulent magnetic fields, if they reach an equipartition level with turbulence energy across all scales during the collapse phase, can significantly affect the properties of the multiple systems. Specifically, both magnetic pressure and torques contribute to disk stabilization, leading to a reduction in the number of fragments, particularly for low-mass stars. Additionally, our observations indicate the launching of protostellar jets driven by magnetic pressure of toroidal fields, although their overall impact on star formation dynamics appears to be minor. Given the case with which seed magnetic fields amplify to the full equipartition level, our results suggest that magnetic fields likely play a significant role in shaping the initial mass function of the first stars, highlighting the importance of magnetic effects on star formation in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Fraction of Dust Mass in the Form of PAHs on 10-50 pc Scales in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium (ISM) in z~0 massive, star-forming galaxies and play key roles in ISM energy balance, chemistry, and shielding. Wide field of view, high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images from JWST provides the ability to map the fraction of dust in the form of PAHs and the properties of these key dust grains at 10-50 pc resolution in galaxies outside the Local Group. We use MIR JWST photometric observations of a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from the "Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS" (PHANGS) survey to investigate the variations of the PAH fraction. By comparison to lower resolution far-IR mapping, we show that a combination of the MIRI filters (R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ = [F770W+F1130W]/F2100W) traces the fraction of dust by mass in the form of PAHs (i.e., the PAH fraction, or q$_{\rm{PAH}}$). Mapping R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ across the 19 PHANGS galaxies, we find that the PAH fraction steeply decreases in HII regions, revealing the destruction of these small grains in regions of ionized gas. Outside HII regions, we find R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ is constant across the PHANGS sample with an average value of 3.43$\pm$0.98, which, for an illuminating radiation field of intensity 2-5 times that of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood, corresponds to q$_{\rm{PAH}}$ values of 3-6%.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of halo and galaxy properties in reducing the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is a fundamental relationship between galaxies and their host dark matter haloes. In this study, we examine the scatter in this relation for primary galaxies in the semi-analytic L-Galaxies model and two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, \eagle{} and \tng{}. We find that in low-mass haloes, more massive galaxies tend to reside in haloes with higher concentration, earlier formation time, greater environmental density, earlier major mergers, and, to have older stellar populations, which is consistent with findings in various studies. Quantitative analysis reveals the varying significance of halo and galaxy properties in determining SHMR scatter across simulations and models. In \eagle{} and \tng{}, halo concentration and formation time primarily influence SHMR scatter for haloes with $M_{\rm h}&lt;10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, but the influence diminishes at high mass. Baryonic processes play a more significant role in \lgal{}. For halos with $M_{\rm h} &lt;10^{11}~\rm M_\odot$ and $10^{12}~\rm M_\odot&lt;M_{\rm h}&lt;10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, the main drivers of scatter are galaxy SFR and age. In the $10^{11.5}~\rm M_\odot&lt;M_{\rm h} &lt;10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$ range, halo concentration and formation time are the primary factors. And for halos with $M_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, supermassive black hole mass becomes more important. Interestingly, it is found that AGN feedback may increase the amplitude of the scatter and decrease the dependence on halo properties at high masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have fulfilled a detailed long-slit spectroscopic analysis for two SB0 galaxies -- NGC 1533 and NGC 1543, -- belonging to the Dorado group. Our spectral data reveal asymmetric decoupled kinematics of the stars and ionised gas in these barred lenticular galaxies that give evidences for external origin of the gas in the rings. We have calculated the star formation rates in the rings by using the ultraviolet fluxes of the rings corrected for the foreground and intrinsic absorption; and we have estimated parameters of the stellar populations in the inner parts of the galaxies confirming that they are old -- except the nucleus of NGC 1543, which demonstrates signatures of re-juvenation less than 5 Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>AGEL: Is the Conflict Real? Investigating Galaxy Evolution Models using Strong Lensing at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations currently limited to $z \lesssim 0.5$. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts between $0.3 &lt; z_{\rm defl} &lt; 0.9$. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope $\gamma$, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm obs}$) for four lenses and obtain $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of $-1.95 \pm 0.09$ and a $\gamma$--$z$ relation that does not evolve with redshift at $z&lt;1$. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at $z&lt;1$ that suggest the $\gamma$--$z$ relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of 1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; 2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and 3) assuming a simple power-law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at $z_{\rm defl} &gt; 0.5$, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Star formation in the high-extinction Planck cold clump PGCC G120.69+2.66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.</description>

      <title>Exploring galactic properties with machine learning Predicting star formation, stellar mass, and metallicity from photometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We explore machine learning techniques to forecast star formation rate, stellar mass, and metallicity across galaxies with redshifts ranging from 0.01 to 0.3.
  Methods. Leveraging CatBoost and deep learning architectures, we utilize multiband optical and infrared photometric data from SDSS and AllWISE, trained on the SDSS MPA-JHU DR8 catalogue.
  Results. Our study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in accurately predicting galaxy properties solely from photometric data. We achieve minimised root mean square errors, specifically employing the CatBoost model. For star formation rate prediction, we attain a value of RMSESFR = 0.336 dex, while for stellar mass prediction, the error is reduced to RMSESM = 0.206 dex. Additionally, our model yields a metallicity prediction of RMSEmetallicity = 0.097 dex.
  Conclusions. These findings underscore the significance of automated methodologies in efficiently estimating critical galaxy properties, amid the exponential growth of multi-wavelength astronomy data. Future research may focus on refining machine learning models and expanding datasets for even more accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>HI Galaxy Signatures in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey -- III. Unveiling the obscured part of the Vela Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a search for HI emission of the gas-rich galaxies in the Vela region ($260^{\circ} \leq \ell \leq 290^{\circ}, -2^{\circ} \leq b \leq 1^{\circ}$) to explore the Vela Supercluster (VSCL) at $V_\mathrm{hel} \sim 18000$ km s$^{-1}$, largely obscured by Galactic dust. Within the mostly RFI-free band ($250 &lt; V_\mathrm{hel} &lt; 25000$ km s$^{-1}$) of MeerKAT, the analysis focuses on $157$ hexagonally distributed pointings extracted from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey located in the Vela region (Vela$-$SMGPS). These were combined into 10 contiguous mosaics, covering a ${\sim}90$ deg$^2$ area. Among the $843$ HI detected sources, 39 were previously discovered in the Parkes HIZOA survey ($V_\mathrm{hel} &lt; 12000$ km s$^{-1}$; rms $\sim 6$ mJy beam$^{-1}$). With the improved rms level of the Vela$-$SMGPS, i.e., $0.29 - 0.56$ mJy beam$^{-1}$, our study unveils nearly 12 times more detections (471 candidates) in that same velocity range. We furthermore could identify $187$ galaxy candidates with an HI mass limit reaching $\log (M_{\rm HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 9.44$ in the VSCL velocity range $V_\mathrm{hel} \sim 19500 \pm 3500$ km s$^{-1}$. We find indications of two wall-like overdensities that confirm the original suspicion that these walls intersect at low latitudes around longitudes of $\ell \sim 272^{\circ} - 278^{\circ}$. We also find a strong signature most likely associated with the Hydra/Antlia extension and evidence of a previously unknown narrow filament at $V_\mathrm{hel} \sim 12000$ km s$^{-1}$. This paper demonstrates the efficiency of systematic HI surveys with the SKA precursor MeerKAT, even in the most obscured part of the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA).</description>

      <title>Faraday tomography with CHIME: the `tadpole' feature G137+7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct consequence of Faraday rotation is that the polarized radio sky does not resemble the total intensity sky at long wavelengths. We analyze G137+7, which is undetectable in total intensity but appears as a depolarization feature. We use the first polarization maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. Our $400-729$ MHz bandwidth and angular resolution, $17'$ to $30'$, allow us to use Faraday synthesis to analyze the polarization structure. In polarized intensity and polarization angle maps, we find a "tail" extending $10^\circ$ from the "head" and designate the combined object the "tadpole". Similar polarization angles, distinct from the background, indicate that the head and tail are physically associated. The head appears as a depolarized ring in single channels, but wideband observations show that it is a Faraday rotation feature. Our investigations of H I and H$\alpha$ find no connections to the tadpole. The tail suggests motion of either the gas or an ionizing star through the ISM; the B2(e) star HD 20336 is a candidate. While the head features a coherent, $\sim -8$ rad m$^2$ Faraday depth, Faraday synthesis also identifies multiple components in both the head and tail. We verify the locations of the components in the spectra using QU fitting. Our results show that $\sim$octave-bandwidth Faraday rotation observations at $\sim 600$ MHz are sensitive to low-density ionized or partially-ionized gas which is undetectable in other tracers.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Star Formation Efficiency in Dense Gas: Initial Results from the CAFFEINE Survey with ArT\'eMiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress, the question of what regulates the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains one of the most debated problems in astrophysics. According to the dominant picture, star formation (SF) is regulated by turbulence and feedback, and the SFE is 1-2% per local free-fall time. In an alternate scenario, the SF rate in galactic disks is linearly proportional to the mass of dense gas above a critical density threshold. We aim to discriminate between these two pictures thanks to high-resolution observations tracing dense gas and young stellar objects (YSOs) for a comprehensive sample of 49 nearby massive SF complexes out to d &lt; 3 kpc in the Galactic disk. We use data from CAFFEINE, a 350/450 $\mu$m survey with APEX/ArT\'eMiS of the densest portions of all southern molecular clouds, in combination with Herschel data to produce column density maps at 8" resolution. Our maps are free of saturation and resolve the structure of dense gas and the typical 0.1 pc width of molecular filaments at 3 kpc, which is impossible with Herschel data alone. Coupled with SFR estimates derived from Spitzer observations of the YSO content of the same clouds, this allows us to study the dependence of the SFE with density in the CAFFEINE clouds. We also combine our findings with existing SFE measurements in nearby clouds to extend our analysis down to lower column densities. Our results suggest that the SFE does not increase with density above the critical threshold and support a scenario in which the SFE in dense gas is approximately constant. However, the SFE measurements traced by Class I YSOs in nearby clouds are more inconclusive, since they are consistent with both the presence of a density threshold and a dependence on density above the threshold. Overall, we suggest that the SFE in dense gas is primarily governed by the physics of filament fragmentation into protostellar cores.</description>

      <title>Background Contamination of the Project Hephaistos Dyson Spheres Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project Hephaistos recently identified seven M-dwarfs as possible Dyson Spheres (DS) candidates. We have cross-matched three of these candidates (A, B \&amp; G) with radio sources detected in various all-sky surveys. The radio sources are offset from the Gaia stellar positions by $\sim 4.9$, $\sim 0.4$ and $\sim 5.0$ arcseconds for candidates A, B, and G respectively. We propose that DOGs (Dust obscured galaxies) lying close to the line-of-sight of these M-dwarf stars significantly contribute to the measured WISE mid-IR flux densities in the WISE W3 and W4 wavebands. These three stars have therefore been misidentified as DS candidates. We also note that with an areal sky density of $9 \times 10^{-6}$ per square arcsecond, Hot DOGs can probably account for the contamination of all 7 DS candidates drawn from an original sample of 5 million stars.</description>

      <title>AstroPT: Scaling Large Observation Models for Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents AstroPT, an autoregressive pretrained transformer developed with astronomical use-cases in mind. The AstroPT models presented here have been pretrained on 8.6 million $512 \times 512$ pixel $grz$-band galaxy postage stamp observations from the DESI Legacy Survey DR8. We train a selection of foundation models of increasing size from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters, and find that AstroPT follows a similar saturating log-log scaling law to textual models. We also find that the models' performances on downstream tasks as measured by linear probing improves with model size up to the model parameter saturation point. We believe that collaborative community development paves the best route towards realising an open source `Large Observation Model' -- a model trained on data taken from the observational sciences at the scale seen in natural language processing. To this end, we release the source code, weights, and dataset for AstroPT under the MIT license, and invite potential collaborators to join us in collectively building and researching these models.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Chromatic Gaussian Process Noise Models for Six Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio-frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency dependent "chromatic" noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by NANOGrav and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar dataset. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from $\log_{10}A_{\text{RN}} = -14.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ to $-14.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$, and the spectral index broadens from $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 2.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ to $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 3.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$. We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray line emission from the Local Bubble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-sea archives that include intermediate-lived radioactive $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ particles suggest the occurrence of several recent supernovae inside the present-day volume of the Local Bubble during the last $\sim 10$ Myr. The isotope $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ is mainly produced in massive stars and ejected in supernova explosions, which should always result in a sizeable yield of $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ from the same objects. $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ decay with lifetimes of 3.82 and 1.05 Myr, and emit $\gamma$-rays at 1332 and 1809 keV, respectively. These $\gamma$-rays have been measured as diffuse glow of the Milky Way, and would also be expected from inside the Local Bubble as foreground emission. Based on two scenarios, one employing a geometrical model and the other state-of-the-art hydrodynamics simulations, we estimate the expected fluxes of the 1332 and 1809 keV $\gamma$-ray lines, as well as the resulting 511 keV line from positron annihilation due to the $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ $\beta^+$-decay. We find fluxes in the range of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ for all three lines with isotropic contributions of 10-50%. We show that these fluxes are within reach for the upcoming COSI-SMEX $\gamma$-ray telescope over its nominal satellite mission duration of 2 yr. Given the Local Bubble models considered, we conclude that in the case of 10-20 Myr-old superbubbles, the distributions of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ are not co-spatial - an assumption usually made in $\gamma$-ray data analyses. In fact, this should be taken into account however when analysing individual nearby targets for their $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ to $^{26}\mathrm{Al}$ flux ratio as this gauges the stellar evolution models and the age of the superbubbles. A flux ratio measured for the Local Bubble could further constrain models of $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$ deposition on Earth and its moon.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode delta Sct stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the largest catalog of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the northern sky to date using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 20 (DR20). The catalog includes 2254 objects, of which 2181 are new to our study. Among these multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, 2142 objects are double-mode $\delta$ Sct, while 109 objects are triple-mode $\delta$ Sct and 3 are quadruple-mode $\delta$ Sct. By analyzing the light curves in the $r$ and $g$ bands of the ZTF, we determine the basic parameters of multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, including the periods and amplitudes. Periods are checked by comparison with the OGLE catalog of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars. On the Petersen diagram, multi-mode $\delta$ Sct stars form six sequences. We find that in Galactic coordinates, the periods of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars at high latitudes are shorter than those of 1O/F double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars in the disk, due to metallicity variations. In the future, our catalog can be used to establish the period--luminosity relation and the period--metallicity relation of double-mode $\delta$ Sct stars, and to study the Galactic structure.</description>

      <title>The host dark matter haloes of the first quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $z &gt; 6$ quasars reside in rare, massive haloes, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology predicts they should be surrounded by an anomalously high number of bright companion galaxies. Here I show that these companion galaxies should also move unusually fast. Using a new suite of cosmological, `zoom-in' hydrodynamic simulations, I present predictions for the velocity distribution of quasar companion galaxies and its variation with quasar host halo mass at $z \, = \, 6$. Satellites accelerate as they approach the quasar host galaxy, producing a line-of-sight velocity profile that broadens with decreasing distance to the quasar host galaxy. This increase in velocity dispersion is particularly pronounced if the host halo mass is $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$. Typical line-of-sight speeds rise to $\approx 500 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ at projected radii $\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$. For about $10\%$ of satellites, they should exceed $800 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$, with $\approx 5\%$ of companions reaching line-of-sight speeds $\sim 1000 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$. For lower host halo masses $\approx 5 \times 10^{11} - 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$, the velocity profile of companion galaxies is significantly flatter. In this case, typical line-of-sight velocities are $\approx 250 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ and do not exceed $\approx 500 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$. A comparison with existing ALMA, JWST and MUSE line-of-sight velocity measurements reveals that observed $z &gt; 6$ quasar companions closely follow the velocity distribution expected for a host halo with mass $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{12} \, \rm M_\odot$, ruling out a light host halo. Finally, through an estimate of UV and \oiii \, luminosity functions, I show that the velocity distribution more reliably discriminates between halo mass than companion number counts, which are strongly affected by cosmic variance.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Drift Map of the Milky Way disk Populations between 8$-$16 kpc with LAMOST and Gaia datasets</title>

Abstract: The application of asymmetric drift (AD) tomography across different populations provides valuable insights into the kinematics, dynamics, and rotation curves of the Galactic disk. By leveraging common stars identified in both the LAMOST and Gaia surveys, alongside Gaia DR3's circular velocity curve, we conducted a qualitative exploration of asymmetric drift distributions within the Galactic disk spanning distances from 8 to 16 kpc. In the R-Z plane, we observed that the asymmetric drift is minimal near the mid-plane of the Galactic disk and gradually increases with vertical distance, resulting in a distinctive ``horn" shape. Additionally, our analysis revealed that populations with higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios exhibit greater asymmetric drift compared to those with lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios. Specifically, we found the asymmetric drift around the solar location to be approximately 6 km s$^{-1}$, with a median value of 16 km s$^{-1}$ across the entire sample. Notably, the median asymmetric drift in the northern region of the Galactic disk (20 km s$^{-1}$) surpasses that in the southern region (13 km s$^{-1}$), with errors remaining within 2 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, our investigation into mono-age stellar populations unveiled that older stellar populations tend to exhibit larger asymmetric drift and velocity dispersion, aligning closely with predictions from previous numerical models. Finally, based on chemical compositions, we observed that the median asymmetric drift of the thick disk significantly exceeds that of the thin disk and found that star formation within the thick disk primarily occurred earlier than 8-10 billion years, whereas the thin disk's predominant star formation period spanned 6-8 billion years ago.</description>

      <title>Sustained super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of $z \gtrsim 6$ quasars provide information on the early evolution of the most massive black holes (MBHs) and galaxies. Current observations, able to trace both gas and stellar properties, reveal a population of MBHs that is significantly more massive than expected from the local MBH-stellar mass relation. The population lies on, but mostly above, the relation observed in the nearby Universe. This suggests that these objects grew very rapidly. To explain their presence when the Universe was less than 1~Gyr old and to assess the physical conditions for their rapid growth, we explored whether episodes of accretion above the Eddington limit can occur across cosmic epochs. By employing state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a $z\sim 7$ quasar, where different accretion regimes are included consistently, together with their associated radiative and kinetic feedback, we show that super-Eddington phases can be sustained for relatively long timescales (tens of millions of years). This allows the MBH to rapidly grow by up to three orders of magnitude, depending on the strength of the kinetic feedback. We also show by means of a semianalytic calculation that the MBH spin remains moderate and does not take on extremely high values during the super-Eddington phases. This results in a lower feedback efficiency, which may allow the rapid growth required to explain over-massive high-redshift MBHs.</description>

      <title>Chemical Cartography with APOGEE: Two-process Parameters and Residual Abundances for 288,789 Stars from Data Release 17</title>

Abstract: Stellar abundance measurements are subject to systematic errors that induce extra scatter and artificial correlations in elemental abundance patterns. We derive empirical calibration offsets to remove systematic trends with surface gravity $\log(g)$ in 17 elemental abundances of 288,789 evolved stars from the SDSS APOGEE survey. We fit these corrected abundances as the sum of a prompt process tracing core-collapse supernovae and a delayed process tracing Type Ia supernovae, thus recasting each star's measurements into the amplitudes $A_{\text{cc}}$ and $A_{\text{Ia}}$ and the element-by-element residuals from this two-parameter fit. As a first application of this catalog, which is $8\times$ larger than that of previous analyses that used a restricted $\log(g)$ range, we examine the median residual abundances of 14 open clusters, nine globular clusters, and four dwarf satellite galaxies. Relative to field Milky Way disk stars, the open clusters younger than 2 Gyr show $\approx 0.1-0.2$ dex enhancements of the neutron-capture element Ce, and the two clusters younger than 0.5 Gyr also show elevated levels of C+N, Na, S, and Cu. Globular clusters show elevated median abundances of C+N, Na, Al, and Ce, and correlated abundance residuals that follow previously known trends. The four dwarf satellites show similar residual abundance patterns despite their different star formation histories, with $\approx 0.2-0.3$ dex depletions in C+N, Na, and Al and $\approx 0.1$ dex depletions in Ni, V, Mn, and Co. We provide our catalog of corrected APOGEE abundances, two-process amplitudes, and residual abundances, which will be valuable for future studies of abundance patterns in different stellar populations and of additional enrichment processes that affect galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>The High-Redshift Gas-Phase Mass-Metallicity Relation in FIRE-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unprecedented infrared spectroscopic capabilities of JWST have provided high-quality interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity measurements and enabled characterization of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for galaxies at $z \gtrsim 5$ for the first time. We analyze the gas-phase MZR and its evolution in a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations at $z=5-12$ and for stellar masses $M_* \sim 10^6-10^{10} \rm{M}_\odot$. These simulations implement a multi-channel stellar feedback model and produce broadly realistic galaxy properties, including when evolved to $z=0$. The simulations predict very weak redshift evolution of the MZR over the redshift range studied, with the normalization of the MZR increasing by less than $0.01$ dex as redshift decreases from $z = 12$ to $z=5$. The median MZR in the simulations is well-approximated as a constant power-law relation across this redshift range given by $\log(Z/Z_\odot) = 0.37\log(M_*/\rm{M}_\odot) - 4.3$. We find good agreement between our best-fit model and recent observations made by JWST at high redshift. The weak evolution of the MZR at $z &gt; 5$ contrasts with the evolution at $z \lesssim 3$, where increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift is observed and predicted by most models. The FIRE-2 simulations predict increasing scatter in the gas-phase MZR with decreasing stellar mass, in qualitative agreement with some observations.</description>

      <title>CAVITY, Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY and project extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have learnt in the last decades that the majority of galaxies belong to high density regions interconnected in a sponge-like fashion. This large-scale structure is characterised by clusters, filaments, walls, where most galaxies concentrate, but also under-dense regions, called voids. The void regions and the galaxies within represent an ideal place for the study of galaxy formation and evolution as they are largely unaffected by the complex physical processes that transform galaxies in high-density environments. These void galaxies can hold the key as well to answer current challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a Legacy project approved by the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopic information of $\sim300$ void galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.050) covering from -17.0 to -21.5 in $\rm r$ band absolute magnitude. It officially started in January 2021 and has been awarded 110 useful dark observing nights at the 3.5 m telescope using the PMAS spectrograph. Complementary follow-up projects including deep optical imaging, integrated, as well as resolved CO data, and integrated HI spectra, have joint the PMAS observations and naturally complete the scientific aim of characterising galaxies in cosmic voids. The extension data has been denominated CAVITY+. The data will be available to the whole community in different data releases, the first of which is planned for July 2024, and it will provide the community with PMAS data cubes for around 100 void galaxies through a user friendly, and well documented, database platform. We present here the survey, sample selection, data reduction, quality control schemes, science goals, and some examples of the scientific power of the CAVITY and CAVITY+ data.</description>

      <title>The ratio of [Eu/$\alpha$] differentiates accreted/in-situ Milky Way stars across metallicities, as indicated by both field stars and globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine stellar orbits with the abundances of the heavy, $r$-process element europium and the light, $\alpha$-element, silicon to separate in-situ and accreted populations in the Milky Way across all metallicities. At high orbital energy, the accretion-dominated halo shows elevated values of [Eu/Si], while at lower energies, where many of the stars were born in-situ, the levels of [Eu/Si] are lower. These systematically different levels of [Eu/Si] in the MW and the accreted halo imply that the scatter in [Eu/$\alpha$] within a single galaxy is smaller than previously thought. At the lowest metallicities, we find that both accreted and in-situ populations trend down in [Eu/Si], consistent with enrichment via neutron star mergers. Through compiling a large dataset of abundances for 46 globular clusters (GCs), we show that differences in [Eu/Si] extend to populations of in-situ/accreted GCs. We interpret this consistency as evidence that in $r$-process elements, GCs trace the star formation history of their hosts, motivating their use as sub-Gyr timers of galactic evolution. Furthermore, fitting the trends in [Eu/Si] using a simple galactic chemical evolution model, we find that differences in [Eu/Si] between accreted and in-situ MW field stars cannot be explained through star formation efficiency alone. Finally, we show that the use of [Eu/Si] as a chemical tag between GCs and their host galaxies extends beyond the Local Group, to the halo of M31 - potentially offering the opportunity to do Galactic Archaeology in an external galaxy.</description>

      <title>Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star formation history as revealed by detailed elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merger was a major event in the history of the Milky Way. Studies on Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxies show that key elemental abundance patterns, which probe different nucleosynthetic channels, reflect the host galaxy's star formation history.
  We gather Mg, Fe, Ba, and Eu abundance measurements for Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus stars from the SAGA database and use [Fe/Mg], [Ba/Mg], [Eu/Mg], and [Eu/Ba], as a function of [Fe/H] to constrain the star formation history of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. We use the known star formation histories and elemental abundance patterns of the Sculptor and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies as comparison.
  The elemental abundance ratios of [Fe/Mg], [Ba/Mg], [Eu/Mg], and [Eu/Ba] all increase with [Fe/H] in Gaia-Sausage- Enceladus. The [Eu/Mg] begins to increase at [Fe/H]= -2.0 and continues steadily, contrasting with the Sculptor dSph galaxy. The [Eu/Ba] increases and remains high across the [Fe/H] range, contrasting with that of the Sculptor dSph galaxy and deviating from the Fornax dSph galaxy at high [Fe/H]. The [Ba/Mg] is higher than those of the Sculptor dSph galaxy at the lowest [Fe/H] and gradually increases, similar to the Fornax dSph galaxy. We constrain three main properties of the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star formation history: 1) star formation started gradually, 2) it extended for over 2 Gyr, and 3) it was quenched around [Fe/H] of -0.5, likely when it fell into the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>A Strong Blend in the Morning: Studying the Circumgalactic Medium Before Cosmic Noon with Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study of the properties of a new class of circumgalactic medium absorbers identified in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest: "Strong, Blended Lyman-$\alpha$" (or SBLA) absorption systems. We study SBLAs at $2.4&lt;z&lt;3.1$ in SDSS-IV/eBOSS spectra by their strong extended Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption complexes covering 138 $\,\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ with an integrated $\log (N_{HI}/$cm$^{-2}) =16.04\substack{+0.05 \\ -0.06}$ and Doppler parameter $b=18.1 \substack{+0.7 \\ -0.4}\,\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$. Clustering with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest provides a large-scale structure bias of $b = 2.34\pm0.06$ and halo mass estimate of $M_h \approx 10^{12}{\rm h^{-1}M_{sol}}$ for our SBLA sample. We measure the ensemble mean column densities of 22 metal features in the SBLA composite spectrum and find that no single-population multiphase model for them is viable. We therefore explore the underlying SBLA population by forward modelling the SBLA absorption distribution. Based on covariance measurements and favoured populations we find that $\approx 25$\% of our SBLAs have stronger metals. Using silicon only we find that our strong metal SBLAs trace gas with a $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) &gt; -2.40$ for $T=10^{3.5}$K and show gas clumping on $&lt;210$ parsec scales. We fit multiphase models to this strong sub-population and find a low ionization phase with $n_H=1$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=0.8$, an intermediate ionization phase with $\log(n_H / $cm$^{-3}) = -3.05$, $T=10^{3.5}$K and $[X/H]=-0.8$, and a poorly constrained higher ionization phase. We find that the low ionization phase favours cold, dense super-solar metallicity gas with a clumping scale of just 0.009 parsecs.</description>
