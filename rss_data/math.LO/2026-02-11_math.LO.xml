      <title>Condensed Sets and the Solovay Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a geometric morphism from the Grothendieck topos representing the Solovay model to the $\kappa$-pyknotic sets of Barwick-Haine and Clausen-Scholze. We then use the properties of this morphism and automatic continuity in the Solovay model to prove Clausen-Scholze's resolution of the Whitehead problem for discrete condensed abelian groups. We also exhibit an analogous internal $Ext$ computation between locally compact abelian groups in the Solovay model.</description>

      <title>Stable Canonical Rules for Intuitionistic Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops stable canonical rules for intuitionistic modal logics, which were first introduced for superintuitionistic logics and transitive nor mal modal logics in [1] and [2] respectively. We first prove that every in tuitionistic modal multi-conclusion consequence relation is axiomatizable by stable canonical rules. This allows us to assume, without loss of generality, that rules considered by us are stable canonical ones. The idea turns out to be useful. In particular, using stable canonical rules, we get an alterna tive proof of the Blok-Esakia theorem for intuitionistic modal logics which was first proved in [3] and generalize it to multi-conclusion consequence re lations. We also prove the Dummett-Lemmon conjecture for intuitionistic modal multi-conclusion consequence relations, which, as far as we know, is a new result.</description>

      <title>Strong Completeness of Provability Logic for Uncountable Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ordinal $\lambda&gt;0$, we use the Erd\H{o}s--Rado partition theorem to prove the failure of strong completeness for modal languages of cardinality $(2^{|\lambda|+\aleph_0})^{+}$ with respect to models on ordinals equipped with the generalized Icard topologies $\mathcal{I}_{\lambda}$ and ${\tau_{c}}_{+\lambda}$. Specifically, we show that for such languages there exists a consistent set of formulas having neither $(\Theta, \mathcal{I}_{\lambda})$-model nor $(\Theta, {\tau_{c}}_{+\lambda})$-model. We also introduce a natural class of topological spaces, called $\lambda$-bouquet spaces, and prove that they yield strong completeness of $\mathsf{GL}$ for languages of cardinality $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Super Black Boxes Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \kappa , \theta &lt; \lambda$ be cardinals, with $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ regular. Concentrating on a simple case, we say that the triple $(\lambda,\kappa,\theta)$ has a Super Black Box when the following holds.
  For some stationary $S \subseteq \{\delta &lt; \lambda : cf(\delta) = \kappa\}$ and $\overline C = \langle C_\delta : \delta \in S \rangle$, where $C_\delta$ is a club of $\delta$ of order type $\kappa$, for every coloring $\overline F = \langle F_\delta : \delta \in S \rangle$ with $F_\delta : {}^{C_\delta}\lambda \to \theta$, there exists $\langle c_\delta : \delta \in S\rangle \in {}^S\!\theta$ such that for every $f : \lambda \to \theta$, for stationarily many $\delta \in S$, we have $F_\delta(f \upharpoonright C_\delta) = c_\delta$.
  In an earlier work, it was proved (along with much more) that for a class of cardinals $\lambda$ this holds for many pairs $(\kappa,\theta)$. E.g.~$\kappa &lt; \aleph_\omega$ is large enough, and $\beth_\omega(\theta) &lt; \lambda$. However, the most interesting cases (at least with regards to Abelian groups) are $\kappa = \aleph_0,\aleph_1$ (which have not been covered yet).
  Here we restrict ourselves to the case where $\overline F$ is a {so-called} \emph{continuous coloring}, which includes the case where $F_\delta$ is computed from some $$ \big\langle F_{\delta,\beta}'(f \upharpoonright (C_\delta \cap \beta)) : \beta \in C_\delta \big\rangle. $$
  This covers the cases we have in mind. We mainly prove results without any other caveats: e.g.
  For every regular $\kappa$ and $\theta$ there exists such a $\lambda$.
  We also deal with having multiple {$\bar C$-s}, and the existence of quite free subsets of ${}^\kappa\mu$.</description>

      <title>Well-quasi-orders on finite trees and transfinite sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-quasi-order (wqo) consisting of the set of finite trees with leaf labels coming from an arbitrary wqo $Q$, ordered by tree homomorphisms which respect the order on the labels. This is a variant of the usual Kruskal tree ordering without infima preservation. We calculate the precise maximal order types of this class of wqos as a function of the maximal order type of the labels $Q$. In the process, we sharpen some recent results of Friedman and Weiermann. Furthermore, we show a correspondence with indecomposable transfinite sequences with finite range, over elements of the wqo $Q$, of length less than $\omega^\omega$. Nash-Williams proved that arbitrary transfinite sequences with finite range are also well-quasi-ordered, but there are no known methods to extract bounds on the maximal order type from the proof. More concrete proofs for sequences of length less than $\alpha$ for some $\alpha &lt; \omega^\omega$ were given by Erd\H{o}s and Rado. Using the correspondence, we obtain precise bounds for the entire collection of transfinite sequences with finite range of length less than $\omega^\omega$.</description>

      <title>Counting spaces of functions on separable compact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the following general problem, closely related to the problem of isomorphic classification of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on a compact space $K$, equipped with the standard supremum norm:Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a class of compact spaces. How many isomorphism types of Banach spaces $C(K)$ of real-valued continuous functions on $K$ are there, for $K\in \mathcal{K}$?
  We prove that for any uncountable regular cardinal number $\kappa$, there exist exactly $2^\kappa$ isomorphism types of spaces $C(K)$ for compact spaces of weight $\kappa$.
  We show that, for the class $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1}$ of separable compact linearly ordered spaces of weight $\omega_1$, the answer to the above question depends on additional set-theoretic axioms. In particular, assuming the continuum hypothesis, there are $2^{2^\omega}$ isomorphism types of $C(L)$, for $L\in \mathcal{L_{\omega_1}}$, and assuming a certain axiom proposed by Baumgartner, there is only one type.</description>

      <title>A Theory for Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new bounded arithmetic theory, denoted $APX_1$, designed to formalize a broad class of probabilistic arguments commonly used in theoretical computer science. Under plausible assumptions, $APX_1$ is strictly weaker than previously proposed frameworks, such as the theory $APC_1$ introduced in the seminal work of Jerabek (2007). From a computational standpoint, $APX_1$ is closely tied to approximate counting and to the central question in derandomization, the prBPP versus prP problem, whereas $APC_1$ is linked to the dual weak pigeonhole principle and to the existence of Boolean functions with exponential circuit complexity.
  A key motivation for introducing $APX_1$ is that its weaker axioms expose finer proof-theoretic structure, making it a natural setting for several lines of research, including unprovability of complexity conjectures and reverse mathematics of randomized lower bounds. In particular, the framework we develop for $APX_1$ enables the formulation of precise questions concerning the provability of prBPP=prP in deterministic feasible mathematics. Since the (un)provability of P versus NP in bounded arithmetic has long served as a central theme in the field, we expect this line of investigation to be of particular interest.
  Our technical contributions include developing a comprehensive foundation for probabilistic reasoning from weaker axioms, formalizing non-trivial results from theoretical computer science in $APX_1$, and establishing a tailored witnessing theorem for its provably total TFNP problems. As a byproduct of our analysis of the minimal proof-theoretic strength required to formalize statements arising in theoretical computer science, we resolve an open problem regarding the provability of $AC^0$ lower bounds in $PV_1$, which was considered in earlier works by Razborov (1995), Krajicek (1995), and Muller and Pich (2020).</description>

      <title>Paths, Ends and The Separation Problem for Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Separation Problem for infinite graphs, which involves determining whether a connected graph splits into at least two infinite connected components after the removal of a given finite set of edges. We prove that this problem is decidable for every highly computable graph with finitely many ends. Using this result, we demonstrate that K\"onig's Infinity Lemma is effective for such graphs. We also apply it to analyze the complexity of the Eulerian Path Problem for infinite graphs, showing that much of its complexity arises from counting ends. Indeed, the Eulerian Path Problem becomes strictly easier when restricted to graphs with a fixed number of ends. Under this restriction, we provide a complete characterization of the problem. Finally, we study the Separation Problem in a uniform setting (i.e., where the graph is also part of the input) and offer a nearly complete characterization of its complexity and its relationship to counting the number of ends.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23787v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the class of Kalm\'ar elementary functions can be inductively generated from the addition, the integer remainder, and the base-two exponentiation, hence improving previous results by Marchenkov and Mazzanti. We also prove that the substitution basis defined by these three operations is minimal. Furthermore, we discuss alternative substitution bases under arity constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform interpolation is a strengthening of interpolation that holds for certain propositional logics. The starting point of this chapter is a theorem of A. Pitts, which shows that uniform interpolation holds for intuitionistic propositional logic. We outline how this theorem may be proved semantically via the definability of bisimulation quantifiers, and how it generalizes to an open mapping theorem between Esakia spaces. We also discuss connections between uniform interpolation and research in categorical logic, algebra, and model theory.</description>

      <title>Mitchell rank for supercompactness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper defines a Mitchell rank for supercompact cardinals. If $\kappa$ is a $\theta$-supercompact cardinal then $o_{\theta-sc}(\kappa) = \sup \{ o_{\theta-sc}(\mu) + 1 \ | \ \mu \in m(\kappa)\}$, where $m(\kappa)$ is the collection of normal fine measures on $P_{\kappa}\theta$. We show how to force to kill the degree of a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ to any specified degree which is less than or equal to the degree of $\kappa$ in the ground model. We will also show how to softly kill the Mitchell rank for supercompactness of any supercompact cardinal so that in the forcing extension it is any desired degree less than or equal to its degree in the ground model, along with some results concerning strongly compact cardinals.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Topological Semantics for Common Inductive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lewis' account of common knowledge in Convention describes the generation of higher-order expectations between agents as hinging upon agents' inductive standards and a shared witness. This paper attempts to draw from insights in learning theory to provide a formal account of common inductive knowledge and how it can be generated by a witness. Our language has a rather rich syntax in order to capture equally rich notions central to Lewis' account of common knowledge; for instance, we speak of an agent 'having some reason to believe' a proposition and one proposition 'indicating' to an agent that another proposition holds. A similar line of work was pursued by Cubitt &amp; Sugden 2003; however, their account was left wanting for a corresponding semantics. Our syntax affords a novel topological semantics which, following Kelly 1996's approach in The Logic of Reliable Inquiry, takes as primitives agents' information bases. In particular, we endow each agent with a 'switching tolerance' meant to represent their personal inductive standards for learning. Curiously, when all agents are truly inductive learners (not choosing to believe only those propositions which are deductively verified), we show that the set of worlds where a proposition $P$ is common inductive knowledge is invariant of agents' switching tolerances. Contrarily, the question of whether a specific witness $W$ generates common inductive knowledge of $P$ is sensitive to changing agents' switching tolerances. After establishing soundness of our proof system with respect to this semantics, we conclude by applying our logic to solve an 'inductive' variant of the coordinated attack problem.</description>
