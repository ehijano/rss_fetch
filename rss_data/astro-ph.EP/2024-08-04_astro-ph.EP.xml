      <title>Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs with PLUTO+PRIZMO I. Lower X-ray-driven mass-loss rates due to enhanced cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Photoevaporation is an important process for protoplanetary disc dispersal but there has so far been a lack of consensus from simulations over the mass-loss rates and the most important part of the high-energy spectrum for driving the wind. Aims: We aim to isolate the origins of these discrepancies through carefully-benchmarked hydrodynamic simulations of X-ray photoevaporation with time-dependent thermochemistry calculated on the fly. Methods: We conduct hydrodynamic simulations with pluto where the thermochemistry is calculated using prizmo. We explore the contribution of certain key microphysical processes and the impact of using different spectra used previously in literature studies. Results: We find that additional cooling results from the excitation of O by neutral H, which leads to dramatically reduced mass-loss across the disc compared to previous X-ray photoevaporation models, with an integrated rate of 10^-9 Msun/yr. Such rates would allow for longer-lived discs than previously expected from population synthesis. An alternative spectrum with less soft X-ray produces mass-loss rates around a factor of 2-3 times lower. The chemistry is significantly out of equilibrium, with the survival of H2 into the wind aided by advection. This leads to its role as the dominant coolant at 10s au - thus stabilising a larger radial temperature gradient across the wind - as well as providing a possible wind tracer.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Sparse Photometry of Jupiter-Family Comet Nuclei in the LSST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory will deliver high-quality, temporally-sparse observations of millions of Solar System objects on an unprecedented scale. Such datasets will likely enable the precise estimation of small body properties on a population-wide basis. In this work, we consider the possible applications of photometric data points from the LSST to the characterisation of Jupiter-family comet (JFC) nuclei. We simulate sparse-in-time lightcurve points with an LSST-like cadence for the orbit of a JFC between 2024-2033. Convex lightcurve inversion is used to assess whether the simulation input parameters can be accurately reproduced for a sample of nucleus rotation periods, pole orientations, activity onsets, shapes and sizes. We find that the rotation period and pole direction can be reliably constrained across all nucleus variants tested, and that the convex shape models, while limited in their ability to describe complex or bilobed nuclei, are effective for correcting sparse photometry for rotational modulation to improve estimates of nucleus phase functions. Based on this analysis, we anticipate that LSST photometry will significantly enhance our present understanding of the spin-state and phase function distributions of JFC nuclei.</description>

      <title>3D simulations of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter HD 189733b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14022v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photochemical hazes have been suggested as candidate for the high-altitude aerosols observed in the transmission spectra of many hot Jupiters. We present 3D simulations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b to study how photochemical hazes are transported by atmospheric circulation. The model includes spherical, constant-size hazes particles that gravitationally settle and are transported by the winds as passive tracers, with particle radii ranging from 1 nm to 300 $\mu$m. We identify two general types of haze distribution based on particle size: In the small-particle regime (&lt;30 nm), gravitational settling is unimportant, and hazes accumulate in two large mid-latitude vortices centered on the night side that extend across the morning terminator. Therefore, small hazes are more concentrated at the morning terminator than at the evening terminator. In the large-particle regime (&gt;30 nm), hazes settle out quickly on the nightside, resulting in more hazes at the evening terminator. For small particles, terminator differences in haze mass mixing ratio and temperature considered individually can result in significant differences in the transit spectra of the terminators. When combining both effects for HD189733b, however, they largely cancel out each other, resulting in very small terminator differences in the spectra. Transit spectra based on the GCM-derived haze distribution fail to reproduce the steep spectral slope at short wavelengths in the current transit observations of HD 189733b. Differing optical properties of hazes, hotter temperatures at low pressures because of heating by hazes, enhanced sub-grid-scale mixing, or star spots might explain the mismatch between the model and observations.</description>

      <title>Variations in the Radius Distribution of Single- and Compact Multiple-transiting Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has established the enhanced occurrence of compact systems of multiple small exoplanets around metal-poor stars. Understanding the origin of this effect in the planet formation process is a topic of ongoing research. Here we consider the radii of planets residing in systems of multiple transiting planets, compared to those residing in single-transiting systems, with a particular focus on late-type host stars. We investigate whether the two radius distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying planetary population. We construct a planetary sample of 290 planets around late K and M dwarfs containing 149 planets from single-transiting planetary systems and 141 planets from multi-transiting compact multiple planetary systems (54 compact multiples). We performed a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Anderson-Darling k-sampling test on the radius distributions of our two samples. We find statistical evidence (p &lt; 0.0026) that planets in compact multiple systems are larger, on average, than their single-transiting counterparts for planets with $R_p &lt;$ 6 R$_\oplus$. We determine that the offset cannot be explained by detection bias. We investigate whether this effect could be explained via more efficient outgassing of a secondary atmosphere in compact multiple systems due to the stress and strain forces of interplanetary tides on planetary interiors. We find that this effect is insufficient to explain our observations without significant enrichment in H$_2$O compared to Earth-like bulk composition.</description>

      <title>KMT-2023-BLG-2669: Ninth Free-floating Planet Candidate with $\theta_{\rm E}$ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a free-floating planet (FFP) candidate identified from the analysis of the microlensing event KMT-2023-BLG-2669. The lensing light curve is characterized by a short duration $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$ and a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.7\,{\rm mag})$. From the analysis, we find the Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} \backsimeq 0.33\,{\rm days}$ and the Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E} \backsimeq 4.41\,{\mu}{\rm as}$. These measurements enable us to infer the lens mass as $M = 8\,M_{\oplus} (\pi_{\rm rel} / 0.1\,{\rm mas})^{-1}$, where $\pi_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. The inference implies that the lens is a sub-Neptune- to Saturn-mass object depending on its unknown distance. This is the ninth isolated planetary-mass microlens with $\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 10\,{\mu}{\rm as}$, which (as shown by \citealt{gould22}) is a useful threshold for a FFP candidate. We conduct extensive searches for possible signals of a host star in the light curve, but find no strong evidence for the host. We investigate the possibility of using late-time high-resolution imaging to probe for possible hosts. In particular, we discuss that for the case of finite-source point-lens FFP candidates, it would be possible to search for very wide separation hosts immediately, although such searches are "high-risk, high-reward".</description>

      <title>Chemical mapping of temperate sub-Neptune atmospheres: Constraining the deep-interior H2O/H2 using the atmospheric CO2/CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the planetary envelope composition of sub-Neptune-type exoplanets is challenging due to the inherent degeneracy in their interior composition scenarios. Particularly, the planetary envelope's H2O/H2 ratio, which can also be expressed as the O/H ratio, provides crucial insights into its original location relative to the ice line during planetary formation. Using self-consistent radiative transfer modeling and a rate-based automatic chemical network generator combined with 1D photochemical kinetic-transport atmospheric modeling, we investigate various atmospheric scenarios of temperate sub-Neptunes, ranging from H2-dominated to H2O-dominated atmospheres with equilibrium temperatures (Teq) of 250-400 K. This study includes examples such as K2-18 b (Teq = 255 K), LP 791-18 c (Teq = 324 K), and TOI-270 d (Teq = 354 K). Our models indicate that the atmospheric CO2/CH4 ratio can be used to infer the deep-interior H2O/H2 ratio. Applying this method to recent JWST observations, our findings suggest K2-18 b likely has an interior that is 50% highly enriched in water, exceeding the water content in a 100xZ scenario and suggesting a planetary formation mechanism involving substantial accretion of ices. In contrast, our model suggests that approximately 25% of TOI-270 d's interior is composed of H2O, which aligns with the conventional metallicity framework with a metallicity higher than 100xZ. Furthermore, our models identify carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) as strong indicators for temperate sub-Neptunes with at least 10% of their interior composed of water. These results provide a method to delineate the internal composition and formation mechanisms of temperate sub-Neptunes (Teq &lt; ~500 K) via atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Rocky planet formation in compact disks around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rocky planets in compact configurations are the most common ones around M dwarfs. Many disks around very low mass stars (between 0.1 and 0.5 M$_\odot$) are rather compact and small (without observable substructures and radius less than 20 au), which favours the idea of an efficient radial drift that could enhance planet formation in compact orbits. We aim to investigate the potential formation paths of the observed close-in rocky exoplanet population around M dwarfs, assuming that planet formation could take place in compact disks with an efficient dust radial drift. We developed N-body simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by pebble accretion exposed to planet-disk interactions, star-planet tidal interactions and general relativistic corrections. For a star of 0.1 M$_\odot$ we considered different gas disk viscosity and initial embryo distributions. We also explore planet formation by pebble accretion around stars of 0.3 and 0.5 M$_\odot$. Lastly, for each stellar mass, we run simulations that include a sample of embryos growing by planetesimal accretion. Our main result is that the sample of simulated planets that grow by pebble accretion in a gas disk with low viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-4}$) can reproduce the close-in low-mass exoplanet population around M dwarfs in terms of multiplicity, masses and semi-major axis. Furthermore, we found that a gas disk with high viscosity ($\alpha=10^{-3}$) can not reproduce the observed planet masses. Also, we show that planetesimal accretion favours the formation of smaller planets than the ones formed by pebble accretion. Rocky planet formation around M dwarfs can take place in compact and small dust disks driven by an efficient radial drift in a gas disk with low viscosity. This result points towards a new approach in the direction of the disk conditions needed for rocky planet formation around very low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Hints of planet formation signatures in a large-cavity disk studied in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program</title>

Abstract: Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program "AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks". The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.</description>

      <title>On the suppression of giant planet formation around low-mass stars in clustered environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Current exoplanet formation studies tend to overlook the birth environment of stars in clustered environments. The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>

      <title>Effects of Variable Mass, Disk-Like Structure, and Radiation Pressure on the Dynamics of Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we intend to investigate the dynamics of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. Here we assumed the primaries as the source of radiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like structure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium points in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like structure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear equilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also breaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the quasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points are stable if the mass ratio $\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\mu_c$. It shows that the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.</description>

      <title>SOLES XII. The Aligned Orbit of TOI-2533 b, a Transiting Brown Dwarf Orbiting an F8-type Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs occupy a middle ground in mass space between gaseous giant planets and ultra-cool dwarf stars, and the characterisation of their orbital orientations may shed light on how these neighbouring objects form. We present an analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of TOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\pm0.0090$) and wide-separation ($a_b/R_\star = 13.34\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type star, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival photometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown dwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf system with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -7\pm14^{\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the brown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also indicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\pm5.3$ M$_{\rm \tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we find that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in a primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.</description>

      <title>Earth tomography with supernova neutrinos at future neutrino detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth neutrino tomography is a realistic possibility with current and future neutrino detectors, complementary to geophysics methods. The two main approaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it propagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth matter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a few tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on supernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter effects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies below $\sim 100$ MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls them. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the contribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the neutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos can have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We shall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation parameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of future neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are presented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors. Assuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core density could be determined within $\lesssim 10\%$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising detector to achieve this goal.</description>
