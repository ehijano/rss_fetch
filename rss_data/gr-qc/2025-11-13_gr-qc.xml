      <title>GUP/BEB correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully expectation--value formulation of the GUP/Bekenstein--bound (BEB) correspondence, building on \cite{Ali:2024tbd,Ali:2022ckm,Ali:2022ulp}. Using Dirac's commutator--Poisson equivalence, the BEB supplies an information backreaction on the GUP--deformed bracket; at saturation the residual uncertainty in a sector cancels, enabling \emph{operational} simultaneity of conjugate expectations and resolving the EPR tension without hidden variables. A single self-consistency then fixes intrinsic confinement scales: the full (linear$+$quadratic) GUP reproduces the hydrogen Bohr radius (electron) and the proton charge radius (hydrogen nucleus). The same correspondence predicts an information--controlled crossover from a short--distance complex (evanescent) regime to an emergent real (Lorentzian) regime, with a symmetry flow from complex $SU(4)$ frames to $SO(1,3)$; under scale transmutation the short--distance $SU(4)$ is repurposed as the Pati--Salam $SU(4)_c$. Incorporating exterior--field entropy at horizons defines an effective Planck constant consistent with generalized--entropy extremality, tying entropy--area physics directly to the GUP at the expectation level.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from Kerr black holes using the Sasaki-Nakamura formalism: waveforms and fluxes at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In linear perturbation theory for Kerr black holes, there are two equivalent formalisms, namely the Teukolsky and the Sasaki-Nakamura (SN) formalism. Typically, one defaults to the Teukolsky formalism, especially when calculating extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, and uses the SN formalism when dealing with extended sources, as it offers superior convergence when employing the Green's function method for calculating the inhomogeneous solution. In this work, we present a new scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation, based on integration by parts, that eliminates the extra radial integration step required in the standard formulation to construct the source term for convolution with the SN variable. Our approach enables efficient computations of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism in all cases, from compact to extended sources. We validate our scheme and code implementation against the literature and find excellent agreement, achieving comparable performance without employing any special optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Excitation factors for horizonless compact objects: long-lived modes, echoes, and greybody factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical and numerical investigation of the quasinormal excitation factors of ultracompact horizonless objects. These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Clines and the Analytic Structure of Black Hole Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit black hole perturbations through Heun differential equations, focusing on Frobenius power-series solutions near regular singularities and their connection formulas. Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under M\"obius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a M\"obius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable.</description>

      <title>Encounter between an extended hyperelastic body and a Schwarzschild black hole with quadrupole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the general relativistic interaction of a small hyperelastic sphere with a Schwarzschild black hole as it follows an initially marginally-bound orbit through a close encounter. While the interaction reveals effects that are encoded by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) multipolar equations through quadrupole order, the calculation is made using an independent general relativistic finite element scheme that we described earlier (Phys.~Rev.~D 108(8):084020, October 2023). The finite element calculation is done in Schwarzschild coordinates, following a large and scalable number of mass elements in interaction with each other through elastic forces derived from a potential energy function and with the spacetime geometry. After the fact, we analyze the dynamics using a local Fermi coordinate system, computing (1) the deviation of the center of mass of the body relative to the initial marginally-bound orbit, (2) changes in orbital and spin angular momenta, and (3) the decrease in orbital energy and accompanying deposition of energy into internal elastic dynamics. The interaction leads to the capture of the small body into a highly eccentric orbit ($e \simeq 0.99998$ in a sample calculation).</description>

      <title>Boundedness for the wave equation on $C^1$ stationary axisymmetric perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the full range of sub-extremal Kerr exterior spacetimes we give a new proof of energy boundedness for high-frequency projections of solutions to the wave equation onto trapped frequencies. A key feature of the new estimate is that it circumvents the use of an integrated local energy decay (ILED) statement. As an illustration of the robustness of the estimate, we use it to establish energy boundedness for solutions to the wave equation on stationary and axisymmetric metrics which are merely $C^1$ close to a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show explicitly that such perturbed metrics may possess stably trapped null geodesics, and thus one does not expect ILED statements to hold.</description>

      <title>Infrared Universality: The $r^{-3}$ Spectral Threshold for Coupled Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the $r^{-3}$ curvature-decay rate as a universal geometric threshold separating compact from non-compact perturbations of Laplace-type operators on asymptotically flat manifolds. For the coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we prove that the linearized operator $\mathcal{L}$ is essentially self-adjoint and that curvature and field strengths decaying faster than $r^{-3}$ act as relatively compact perturbations, while decay exactly at $r^{-3}$ places $0\in\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(\mathcal{L})$ through delocalized zero modes. This threshold mechanism unifies the infrared behavior of spin-1, spin-2, and mixed spin-$(1\oplus2)$ fields, linking the onset of spectral delocalization with the appearance of gravitational and electromagnetic memory. Finite-difference simulations corroborate the analytic scaling and reproduce the characteristic quadrupolar and dipolar sky maps predicted for the coupled memory fields. These results demonstrate that curvature decay at $r^{-3}$ constitutes a fundamental geometric boundary underlying infrared universality in gauge and gravitational theories, providing a spectral counterpart to the asymptotic-symmetry and soft-theorem formulations of memory.</description>

      <title>Thermal field theories coupled to curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal field theory is an essential tool for comprehending various physical phenomena, including astrophysical objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as the early stages of the universe. Nonetheless, the traditional thermal field theory formulated in Minkowski spacetime is not capable of considering the effects originating from the curved spacetime. These effects are crucial for both astrophysical and cosmological observations, making it essential to extend the domain of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes. This article's primary focus is to explore the extension of thermal field theory to curved spacetimes and its implications. We employ Riemann-normal coordinates to describe thermal field theories in curved spacetime, and we also calculate several thermodynamic observables to demonstrate the curvature corrections explicitly.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of a Generalized Vaidya Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there can not be a smooth matching of the Generalized Vaidya metric with an exterior Schwarzschild/Vaidya patch across a finite boundary hypersurface unless the mass function is a function of the null coordinate alone. By explicitly deriving the extrinsic curvature components, we show that for $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ one has a discontinuity in the curvature and induces a surface stress-energy tensor, corresponding to a thin shell of matter. This discontinuity also appears in the geometric invariant $\mathcal{K} = K_{ab}K^{ab}$ and in the Kodama current, indicating a mismatch in quasi-local energy flux across the boundary. The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\partial m / \partial r \neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface. We therefore note that the generalized Vaidya spacetime should be interpreted as an unbounded geometry with intrinsic heat flux rather than a viable bounded source.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inflation in $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological inflation remains a key paradigm for explaining the earliest stages of the Universe, yet the theoretical limitations of General Relativity (GR) motivate the development of alternative formulations capable of addressing both early and late cosmic acceleration. In this work, we investigate cosmological inflation within the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity framework based on symmetric teleparallel geometry, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. We formulate the slow-roll dynamics and derive analytical predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in both linear and nonlinear non-minimal coupling models, assuming a power-law inflaton potential. Our findings show that the linear case, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-\alpha Q + 2\mathcal{L}_{m}+\beta$, becomes compatible with Planck+BK15+BAO constraints for positive $\alpha$ and $\beta$, producing narrow viable contours in parameter space. In contrast, the nonlinear model, $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})=-\alpha Q+(2\mathcal{L}_{m})^{2}+\beta$, achieves observational viability only for negative $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and its predictions predominantly fall inside the $68\%$ confidence region of joint data. These results demonstrate that $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity produces distinct inflationary regimes, providing a highly competitive alternative to GR.</description>

      <title>Angular velocity of rotating black holes -- a new way to construct initial data for binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a geometric understanding of the angular velocity of a Kerr black hole in terms of a quasi-conformal map that describes a 2d Beltrami fluid flow, a new way to construct initial data sets for binary rotating black holes by prescribing the angular velocities of the two black holes at their horizons is discussed. A set of elliptic equations with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizons and at spatial infinity is established for constructing the initial data. To explore the dynamics encoded in these initial data, we consider the conformally flat three-metric case and numerically evolve it using the BSSN code for two co-rotating and counter-rotating black holes with angular velocities prescribed at the horizons. When the angular velocities are non-uniform and deviate from a constant value at the horizons, new gravitational waveforms are generated which display certain oscillatory pattern reminiscent of that of quasi-normal ringing in the inspiral phase before merger takes place.</description>

      <title>Scalar field scattering in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve analytically the low-frequency s-wave dynamics of a massless scalar field propagating on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole background. A rigorous application of the method of matched asymptotic expansions allows us to connect the scalar's evolution in the proximity of the black-hole horizon with that on cosmological scales. The scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay are computed explicitly. We consider both small and large black holes, with black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. In addition, for small black holes we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under $\omega\leftrightarrow 1/r_c$ (where $\omega$ is the scalar's frequency and $r_c$ the cosmological horizon radius).</description>

      <title>Boosting Gravity-Induced Entanglement through Parametric Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing quantum gravity theory remains one of the major challenges in modern physics, as the lack of experimental evidence makes it difficult to explore. In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping. As a result, we find an exponential growth of gravity-induced entanglement between the oscillators, which reflects the dynamical instability of parametric resonant systems.</description>

      <title>Novel scalar degrees of freedom emerging from hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity unifies the metric and Palatini formalisms while preserving a propagating scalar degree of freedom, offering a compelling route to modified gravity consistent with current observations. Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $\phi$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars. These results show that the linear-$f(\hat{R})$ HMPST subclass provides a consistent and unified description of gravity across cosmological, astrophysical, and Solar System scales, offering a fertile framework for connecting modified gravity to observations and effective field-theoretic extensions.</description>

      <title>Ray tracing for the Terrell-Penrose effect in black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent images of black holes in M87 and our galaxy, efficient relativistic ray tracing was developed to simulate the snapshots of variable emissions around the black holes. Half a century ago, the appearance of a moving emission source was addressed by Terrell and Penrose, who independently found that the aberration effect induces a conformal transformation on the observer's celestial sphere. Consequently, a snapshot of a moving sphere should remain circular. In this study, we examine the Terrell-Penrose effect with our ray-tracing simulations for two contrasting cases: i) static emission sources in the view of a moving observer, ii) and moving emission sources in the view of a static observer. In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source.</description>

      <title>Imaging and polarization patterns of various thick disks around Kerr-MOG black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $\alpha$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\alpha$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\chi_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angle\beta_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $\alpha$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative geometry and thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole within the framework of noncommutative geometry. We derive and analyze the black hole's thermodynamic functions, showing that they depend critically on the noncommutativity parameter denoted as {\Theta}, while still satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. Stability analysis reveals that the noncommutative Schwarzschild-AdS black hole undergoes a phase transition at a critical point. Moreover, the thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of a van der Waals fluid, with the noncommutativity introducing a correction term to the black hole's surface temperature. Our results indicate that the noncommutativity parameter {\Theta} is of the order of the Planck scale and functions as a novel thermodynamic variable within the system.</description>

      <title>Dark-Energy Anisotropic Compact Configurations in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity: From Structure to Observational Viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium configurations and stability properties of anisotropic compact stars whose interior is described by a modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) equation of state in the framework of the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) theory. Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ and the degree of anisotropy $\beta$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $\gamma_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $\alpha$ and positive anisotropy $(\beta &gt; 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\,M_\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(\alpha,\beta)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable. In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Apparent Horizons due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an apparent horizon can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of apparent horizons due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior apparent horizon imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. This is the first part of a two-part sequence, and in the sequel, we will focus on explicitly constructing the Cauchy data.</description>

      <title>On vacuum and charged asymptotically (A)dS black holes in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic properties of static spherically symmetric black holes in quadratic gravity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We find that for sufficiently large values of $|\Lambda|$ these black holes are generically asymptotically (A)dS and form a three-parameter family of black holes, with free parameters being the horizon radius, $\Lambda$, and Bach parameter $b$. For smaller values of $|\Lambda|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics. One family is the (A)dS-Schwarzschild solution, the other is a fine-tuned asymtotically (A)dS-Schwarzschild-Bach solution. We also generalise the above solutions to electrically charged black holes, obtaining qualitatively similar asymptotic behaviour. This adds the electric charge as an additional free parameter of these black holes. Both fine-tuned three-parameter families are distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Probing Intrinsic Ellipticity in Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel resonance mechanism that can naturally occur in neutron star binaries: a spin-orbit resonance. This resonance locks the binary into a unique state where the neutron star spin evolves alongside the orbit. The resonance requires a finite neutron star ellipticity $\epsilon$ possibly sourced by strong internal magnetic fields in magnetars, which are motivated by population study of eccentric neutron star-black hole binary GW200105. We find that the locking probability is proportional to $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We derive the phase correction in the gravitational waveform due to this resonance locking effect, and have conducted a search in all neutron star binaries up to the O4a gravitational-wave catalog, with no positive event found so far. Observations by next-generation detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, or even the upcoming upgrade of Advanced LIGO, have the potential to detect such locking signals, enabling precise measurements of both neutron star's ellipticity and moment of inertia. Future searches should be performed to discover this resonance, or, if undetected, to place constraints on the magnetar fraction in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for relativistic quantum thermal machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension problem is one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data. Our findings advocate for further exploration of HDE models using other types of cosmological observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the generation rate of the quantum entanglement in a system composed of multiple massive particles with large spin, where the mass of a single particle can be split into multiple trajectories by a generalized Stern-Gerlach interferometer. Taking the coherent spin states (CSS) as the initial state and considering the gravitational interaction due to Newtonian potential, we compute the generation rate of the entanglement for different configurations of the setup. Explicitly, the optimal polar angles of the spin are found numerically for systems with three and four particles, respectively. We conclude that the amount of the entanglement increases with the number of particles as well as the spin, and the configuration of the prism with a particle at the center generates the best rate of the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon flow on FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new approach to generally covariant quantum mechanics applied in the case of an FLRW cosmological background. For positive spatial curvature we find a discrete series of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation that can reasonably be called gravitationally bound `cosmological atom' states. For all cases of curvature, these modes, as well as more conventional atomic spatial modes bound by an external potential, extend to solutions of the Klein-Gordon equations viewed as stationary modes of Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics where wavefunctions are over spacetime and evolution is with respect to an external `geodesic time' parameter $s$. For general nonstationary states with fixed spatial eigenvector, the theory reduces to a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time $t$ axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. Its behaviour, and hence the evolution of spatial states, changes critically when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>

      <title>Exploring black hole shadows in axisymmetric spacetimes with coordinate-independent methods and neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of black hole shadows provides a powerful tool for testing the predictions of general relativity and exploring deviations from the standard Kerr metric in the strong gravitational field regime. Here, we investigate the shadow properties of axisymmetric gravitational compact objects using a coordinate-independent formalism. We analyze black hole shadows in various spacetime geometries, including the Kerr, Taub-NUT, $\gamma$, and Kaluza-Klein metrics, to identify distinctive features that can be used to constrain black hole parameters. To achieve a more robust characterization, we employ both Legendre and Fourier expansions, demonstrating that the Fourier approach may offer better coordinate independence and facilitate cross-model comparisons. Finally, we develop a machine learning framework based on neural networks trained on synthetic shadow data, enabling precise parameter estimation from observational results. Using data from observational astronomical facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), Keck, and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), we provide constraints on black hole parameters derived from shadow observations. Our findings highlight the potential of coordinate-independent techniques and machine learning for advancing black hole astrophysics and testing fundamental physics beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential, corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect in rotating spacetimes?</description>

      <title>Robust topological invariants of timelike circular orbits for spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-curvature coupling in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) formalism induces non-geodesic motion, shifting the orbital parameters of spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes. We investigate whether these quantitative shifts alter the qualitative, global structure of the orbit manifold. Using a topological approach, we study timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for spinning particles in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. By constructing an auxiliary vector field, we compute the topological winding number $W$ in horizon-bounded regions of asymptotically flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) backgrounds. We find that $W$ is robust against both the magnitude and direction of the particle's spin: between two horizons, $W = -1$, guaranteeing at least one unstable TCO; outside the outermost horizon in asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes, $W = 0$, enforcing that TCOs must appear in stable-unstable pairs or be absent. This spin independence reveals that the fundamental orbital structure is a property of spacetime geometry itself, not of the particle's spin. We validate this with quantitative examples in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS, and Schwarzschild-dS spacetimes, showing explicit spin-induced TCO shifts while confirming the invariant topology. This result provides a topological foundation for interpreting gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals involving spinning secondaries.</description>

Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48\pi}\kappa_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2\kappa_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler-strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr-Newman, $\Lambda&gt;0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler Equation from Effective Action: Implications for the Smarr Formula in AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Euler equation, $\epsilon+p=sT+\mu q+y\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}$, using the effective field theory formulation of perfect fluids. This generalization was achieved by introducing a new variable $y$ into the effective action, which encodes a geometrical scale of the spacetime where the fluid is on. Notably, the generalized Euler equation is independent of the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, when applied to a holographic perfect fluid, this equation naturally recovers the Smarr formula for AdS black holes, thus situating the physical interpretation of the Smarr formula within the framework of well-established physics. Finally, our findings raise important questions regarding the validity of treating the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a thermodynamic variable, as proposed in certain frameworks within the literature.</description>

Abstract: We consider soft graviton scattering for a theory where Einstein's gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, i.e. in a background de Sitter space. Employing a perturbative expansion in a small cosmological constant, we compute leading, subleading and sub-subleading corrections to Weinberg's soft graviton amplitude for the tree-level scatterings in the static patch of de Sitter space. We observe similar universal features of the soft graviton amplitude as found in [JHEP10(2023)055] for the soft photons.</description>

      <title>Collapse-based models for gravity do not violate the entanglement-based witness of non-classicality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that an entanglement-based witness of non-classicality can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. Specifically, if a system can create entanglement between two quantum probes by local means only, then it must be non-classical. Recently, claims have been made that collapse-based models of classical gravity, i.e. Di\'osi-Penrose model, can predict gravitationally induced entanglement between quantum objects, resulting in gravitationally induced entanglement is insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum, contrary to the witness statement. Here we vindicate the witness. We analyze the underlying physics of collapse-based models for gravity and show that these models have nonlocal features, violating the principle of locality.</description>

      <title>The 2D Lorentz-violating fermionic Casimir effect under thermal conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we study a fermionic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) theory with a CPT-even extension and analyze its impact on the Casimir effect under the MIT bag boundary condition model in a low-dimensional setting, where results are obtained without any approximations for a null-temperature system. Moreover, the Matsubara formalism is applied to derive closed expressions for the influence of temperature on the physical observables: Casimir energy, Casimir force, and entropy associated with the system in a LIV context. For each thermal observable, the influence of the LIV correction term is considered in the analysis of both low- and high-temperature regimes. Additionally, we construct a condensed matter analogue using the SSH model, where nonlinear fermionic dispersion and boundary-induced vacuum energy emerge, reproducing the analytical structure of the LIV Casimir effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. The semiclassical stress tensor is evaluated in a Schwarzschild background taking a time-independent limit for the quantum state. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.</description>

      <title>Approximate reconstruction of inflationary potential with ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has recently reported updated measurements of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, revealing a tension with the predictions of many conventional inflationary models. In this work, we adopt a parameterization of the spectral index in the form $n_s = 1 - p/(N + \alpha)$ with $1.338&lt;p&lt;1.746$, to reconstruct an inflationary potential consistent with the latest ACT data. The resulting potential is the Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) potential $V(\phi) = V_0/[1 + (M/\phi)^n]$, where the power index is given by $n = 2(p-1)/(2-p)$. The corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio is approximately $r \approx 16(p-1)/[C (N+\alpha)^p]$ with $C= 2^{2p-1} \left[\sqrt{p-1}/(2-p)\right]^{2p-2} /M^{2p-2}$. Since the reconstruction under the slow-roll approximation is model-independent, the KKLT model can serve as an effective approximation to a broad class of inflationary scenarios that are consistent with the latest ACT measurements of $n_s$, at least on large scales.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of useful criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise initial conditions (ICs) are crucial for accurate computation in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Inflation from a generalized exponential plateau: towards extra suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a standard minimally-coupled scalar-field inflationary scenario, which is based on a new potential, with suitably generalized plateau features, that leads to extra small tensor-to-scalar ratios. In particular, we consider a specific three-parameter potential, which has a flatter plateau and a steeper well compared to the Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame. We study the inflationary realization and we show that it guarantees a prolonged period of slow-roll inflation and a successful exit. Additionally, the steeper minimum leads to significantly suppressed tensor perturbations, and thus to an extra-small tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and we show that we are able to obtain $r$ values less than $10^{-5}$. Moreover, we calculate the reheating temperature showing that in order to be in agreement with observations one of the potential parameters should remain within specific bounds. Finally, performing an inverse conformal transformation to the Jordan frame we show that the considered potential corresponds to higher-order corrections to Starobinsky potential in the Einstein frame, and these corrections are the reason for the improved behavior of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. A modified recombination scenario involving a time-varying electron mass has been proposed as a feasible solution to the Hubble tension without exacerbating the $S_8$ tension. Recent observations have further revealed other potential deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM framework, such as non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Using the Planck Public Release (PR) 3 and ACT power spectra, Planck PR4 and ACT lensing maps, together with BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0068}_{-0.0066}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both exceeding the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. However, when adopting the latest Planck power spectra likelihoods, NPIPE and HiLLiPoP, we obtain lower electron masses with $\Delta m_e / m_e = -0.0063^{+0.0095}_{-0.0099}$ and $-0.0095^{+0.0078}_{-0.0079}$, relieving the $S_8$ tension only. The lensing amplitude remains anomalously high, with $A_{\rm lens} = 1.053^{+0.042}_{-0.040}$ and $1.075^{+0.044}_{-0.043}$. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile the aforementioned discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify the aforementioned modifications.</description>

      <title>Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the model\'s ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.</description>

      <title>Reionization optical depth and CMB-BAO tension in punctuated inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the standard six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, a $2$-$3\sigma$ tension persists between baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although this tension has often been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy or a sum of neutrino masses below the established minimum, recent studies suggest it may instead originate from an underestimation of the reionization optical depth, particularly when inferred from large-scale CMB polarization. Jhaveri et al. propose that a suppression of large-scale primordial curvature power could partially cancel the contribution of $\tau$ to the CMB low-$\ell$ polarization power spectrum, leading to a biased low $\tau$ measurement in standard analyses. In this work, we investigate whether punctuated inflation - which generates a suppression of primordial power on large scales through a transient fast-roll phase - can raise the inferred $\tau$ value and thereby reconcile the consistency between CMB and BAO. For simple models with step-like features in the inflaton potential, we find that the constraint on $\tau$ and the CMB-BAO tension remain nearly identical to those in the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. We provide a physical explanation for this negative result.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-bulk photon propagator in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the photon bulk-to-bulk propagator in AdS in various gauges, including axial, Coulomb, and the standard covariant gauge. We compute the propagator using both momentum and position space techniques. We ensure the propagators obtained obey the right subsidiary conditions arising from gauge invariance. In particular, BRST invariance implies a relation between the longitudinal components of the gauge field propagator and the ghost bulk-to-bulk propagator. Our method relies on decomposing the components of the propagator in terms of independent tensor structures and solving for the form factors. We recover some previously existing results and obtain new expressions for the propagator in other gauges. The propagator in axial and Coulomb gauge is simpler in momentum space, as momentum space makes manisfest the translational invariance in the boundary directions, while the position space expression is the simplest in the covariant Fried-Yennie gauge. In this gauge the propagator has an improved IR behavior, somewhat analogous to the UV improved behavior associated with the Landau gauge in flat space. The results readily extend to Yang-Mills fields.</description>

      <title>Thermal superpotential and thermodynamics of neutral hairy black holes in extended SUGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm, explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal symmetry.</description>
