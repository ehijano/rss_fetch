      <title>Exploring Multimodal AI Reasoning for Meteorological Forecasting from Skew-T Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting from atmospheric soundings is a fundamental task in operational meteorology, often requiring structured visual reasoning over Skew-T log-P diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work could extend it to more complex applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Forcing Behind Rapid Intensification of Hurricane Lidia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines Hurricane Lidia rapid intensification (RI) in the understudied northeastern Pacific, focusing on its interaction with an upper-level trough. Using IFS-ECMWF ensemble forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis, we analyze the large-scale dynamical mechanisms driving Lidias intensification. Results show that the trough played a crucial role in promoting RI by enhancing synoptic-scale ascent, upper-level divergence, and eddy flux convergence. In the higher-intensification ensemble group, stronger Trenberth forcing emerged prior to RI onset, suggesting a causative role in preconditioning the storm environment. This dynamical forcing likely triggered latent heat release, which in turn modified the upper-level potential vorticity structure and contributed to a subsequent reduction in vertical wind shear. In contrast, the lower-intensification group exhibited weaker forcing, higher shear, and a lack of sustained ventilation. These findings highlight the importance of diagnosing early dynamical triggers for RI, particularly in regions where operational access to high-resolution models is limited. This approach provides a cost-effective framework for anticipating RI using ensemble-based diagnostics and could serve as a valuable forecasting tool in data-sparse areas such as the Pacific coast of Mexico. Future studies should combine this large-scale methodology with high-resolution simulations to better capture storm-scale processes and validate multi-scale interactions in RI events.</description>

      <title>Rare event sampling for moving targets: extremes of temperature and daily precipitation in a general circulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events epitomize high cost: to society through their physical impacts, and to computer servers that are used to simulate them to provide information to mitigate those impacts. It costs hundreds of years to sample a few once-per-century events with straightforward model integration, but that cost can be much reduced with rare event sampling, which nudges ensembles of simulations to convert moderate events to severe ones, e.g., by steering a cyclone directly through a region of interest. With proper statistical accounting, rare event algorithms can provide quantitative climate risk assessment at reduced cost. But this can only work if ensemble members diverge fast enough. Sudden, transient events characteristic of Earth's midlatitude storm track regions, such as heavy precipitation and heat extremes, pose a particular challenge because they come and go faster than an ensemble can explore the possibilities. Here we extend standard rare event algorithms to handle this challenging case in an idealized atmospheric general circulation model, achieving 5-10 times sped-up estimation of long return periods, such as 100-150 years from only 20 years of simulation for extremes of daily precipitation and surface temperature. The algorithm, called TEAMS (``trying-early adaptive multilevel splitting''), was developed previously in Finkel and O'Gorman (2024) using a toy chaotic system, and relies on a key parameter -- the advance split time -- which may be estimated based on simple diagnostics of ensemble dispersion rates. The results are promising for accelerated risk assessment across a wide range of physical hazards using more realistic and complex models with acute computational constraints.</description>

      <title>SQG Point Vortex Dynamics with Order Rossby Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-geostrophic flow is an asymptotic theory for flows in rotating systems that are in geostrophic balance to leading order. It is characterized by the conservation of (quasi-geostrophic) potential vorticity and weak vertical flows. Surface quasigeostrophy (SQG) is the special case when the flow is driven by temperature anomalies at a horizontal boundary. The next-order correction to QG, QG+, takes into account ageostrophic effects. We investigate point vortx dynamics in SQG+, building on the work of Weiss. The conservation laws for SQG point vortices that parallel the 2D Euler case no longer exist when ageostrophic effects are included. The trajectories of point vortices are obtained explicitly for the general two-vortex case in SQG and SQG+. For the three-vortex case, exact solutions are found for rigidly rotating and stationary equilibria consisting of regular polygons and collinear configurations. As in the 2D case, only certain collinear vortex configurations are rigid equilibria. Trajectories of passive tracers advected by point vortex systems are studied numerically, in particular their vertical excursions, which are non-zero because of ageostrophic effects. Surface trajectories can manifest local divergence even though the underlying fluid equations are incompressible.</description>

      <title>OneForecast: A Universal Framework for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are important for disaster prevention, agricultural planning, etc. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods offer physically interpretable high-accuracy predictions but are computationally expensive and fail to fully leverage rapidly growing historical data. In recent years, deep learning models have made significant progress in weather forecasting, but challenges remain, such as balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts, excessive smoothing in extreme event predictions, and insufficient dynamic system modeling. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework (OneForecast) based on graph neural networks. By combining a dynamic system perspective with multi-grid theory, we construct a multi-scale graph structure and densify the target region to capture local high-frequency features. We introduce an adaptive messaging mechanism, using dynamic gating units to deeply integrate node and edge features for more accurate extreme event forecasting. For high-resolution regional forecasts, we propose a neural nested grid method to mitigate boundary information loss. Experimental results show that OneForecast performs excellently across global to regional scales and short-term to long-term forecasts, especially in extreme event predictions.

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Wind-Drift Currents at Mid-Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean at mid-latitudes, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>
