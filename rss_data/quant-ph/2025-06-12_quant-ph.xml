      <title>Eigenlogic and Probabilistic Inference; when Bayes meets Born</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows how inference is treated within the context of Eigenlogic projection operators in linear algebra. In Eigenlogic operators represent logical connectives, their eigenvalues the truth-values and the associated eigenvectors the logical models. By extension, a probabilistic interpretation is proposed using vectors outside the eigensystem of the Eigenlogic operators. The probability is calculated by the quantum mean value (Born rule) of the logical projection operators. We look here for possible connections between the Born rule in quantum mechanics and Bayes' theorem from probability theory and show that Eigenlogic offers an innovative approach to address the probabilistic version of logical inference (material implication) in a quantum context.</description>

      <title>Quantum resources in resource management systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are beginning to operate in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Quantum can complement classical resources for specific workloads, but their adoption depends on integration into existing HPC infrastructure. Treating quantum devices as first-class resources allows for unified scheduling, improved usability, and support for hybrid quantum-classical applications. This paper presents the design architecture and reference implementation for quantum resources control using existing workload management systems. We introduce a suite of plugins for Slurm that enable integration of on-prem and cloud quantum computing resources into existing high-performance computing centers. The paper details the interface design, plugin concept and implementation, operational aspects for heterogeneous compute clusters, as well as considerations for other resource management systems.</description>

      <title>Cooling a Qubit using n Others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the task of unitarily cooling a quantum system with access to a larger quantum system, known as the machine or reservoir, how does the structure of the machine impact an agent's ability to cool and the complexity of their cooling protocol? Focusing on the task of cooling a single qubit given access to $n$ separable, thermal qubits with arbitrary energy structure, we answer these questions by giving two new perspectives on this task. Firstly, we show that a set of inequalities related to the energetic structure of the $n$ qubit machine determines the optimal cooling protocol, which parts of the machine contribute to this protocol and gives rise to a Carnot-like bound. Secondly, we show that cooling protocols can be represented as perfect matchings on bipartite graphs enabling the optimization of cost functions e.g. gate complexity or dissipation. Our results generalize the algorithmic cooling problem, establish new fundamental bounds on quantum cooling and offer a framework for designing novel autonomous thermal machines and cooling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics in the vicinity of an unstable fixed point subjected to stochastic control. The stochastic competition between the system's inherent instability (pushing trajectories away) and engineered control dynamics (drawing them back to the same point) forms the core of probabilistic control in chaotic systems. Recent studies reveal that this interplay underlies a family of measurement- and feedback-driven dynamical quantum phase transitions. To capture its universal features, we consider the inverted harmonic oscillator, a canonical model whose operator amplitudes diverge. Our control scheme, a quantum version of classical attractor dynamics, employs non-unitary evolution via measurements and conditional resets. By combining numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck analysis, and direct spectra of the quantum channel, we map out the control transition and uncover quantum-specific signatures of the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate the universality of our results within the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limits from Symmetries in Quantum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum control, quantum speed limits provide fundamental lower bounds on the time that is needed to implement certain unitary transformations. Using Lie algebraic methods, we link these speed limits to symmetries of the control Hamiltonians and provide quantitative bounds that can be calculated without solving the controlled system dynamics. In particular we focus on two scenarios: On one hand, we provide bounds on the time that is needed for a control system to implement a given target unitary $U$ and on the other hand we bound the time that is needed to implement the dynamics of a target Hamiltonian $H$ in the worst case. We apply our abstract bounds on physically relevant systems like coupled qubits, spin chains, globally controlled Rydberg atoms and NMR molecules and compare our results to the existing literature. We hope that our bounds can aid experimentalists to identify bottlenecks and design faster quantum control systems.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis states for robust entangled differential phase sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing sensors with large particle numbers $N$ that can resolve subtle physical effects is a central goal in precision measurement science. Entangled quantum sensors can surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), where the signal variance scales as $1/N$, and approach the Heisenberg limit (HL) with variance scaling as $1/N^2$. However, entangled states are typically more sensitive to noise, especially common-mode noise such as magnetic field fluctuations, control phase noise, or vibrations in atomic interferometers. We propose a two-node entanglement-enhanced quantum sensor network for differential signal estimation that intrinsically rejects common-mode noise while remaining robust against local, uncorrelated noise. This architecture enables sensitivities approaching the Heisenberg limit. We investigate two state preparation strategies: (i) unitary entanglement generation analogous to bosonic two-mode squeezing, yielding Heisenberg scaling; and (ii) dissipative preparation via collective emission into a shared cavity mode, offering a $\sqrt{N}$ improvement over the SQL. Numerical simulations confirm that both protocols remain effective under realistic conditions, supporting scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in the presence of dominant common-mode noise.</description>

      <title>Hybrid discrimination strategy based on photon-number-resolving detectors and mesoscopic twin-beam states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State discrimination is a key challenge in the implementation of quantum communication protocols. Most optical communication protocols rely on either coherent states of light or fragile single-photon states, making it often difficult to achieve robustness and security simultaneously. In this work, we propose a hybrid strategy that operates in the mesoscopic intensity regime, leveraging robust quantum states of light. Our approach combines classical and quantum features: reliable state discrimination based on a classical property of light, and security stemming from nonclassical correlations. Specifically, the receiver uses photon-number-resolving detectors to access the mean photon number of the binary thermal signals encoding the information. The communication channel exploits twin-beam states, inherently sensitive to eavesdropping attacks, to provide a layer of security. This strategy is scalable, allowing for straightforward extension to more complex signal alphabets, and offers a promising route for robust and secure quantum communication in the mesoscopic intensity domain.</description>

      <title>Symmetric quantum states: a review of recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric quantum states are fascinating objects. They correspond to multipartite systems that remain invariant under particle permutations. This symmetry is reflected in their compact mathematical characterisation and also in their unique physical properties: they exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement and notable robustness against noise and perturbations. These features make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum information tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical structure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the theoretical framework, it is essential to develop robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties of symmetric states in experimental settings. In this regard, we explore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell tests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric systems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant applications in which these states outperform other classes of states in specific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum metrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine their contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present the current state of the art in their experimental generation, ranging from systems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review the most recent breakthroughs obtained in the different experimental realizations. Despite the significant progress made in recent years regarding the characterization and application of symmetric quantum states, several intriguing questions remain unsolved. We conclude this review discussing some of these open problems and outlining promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Constructive interference at the edge of quantum ergodic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum observables in the form of few-point correlators are the key to characterizing the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In dynamics with fast entanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to the details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of scrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been successfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using a 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics using the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast to dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain sensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by inserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases of Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in OTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by constructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in configuration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$ with a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a set of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity of known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian learning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Isoholonomic inequalities and speed limits for cyclic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds -- such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin -- rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive new quantum speed limits that remain nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</description>

      <title>Synchronization for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes store information reliably in logical qubits by encoding them in a larger number of less reliable qubits. The surface code, known for its high resilience to physical errors, is a leading candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Logical qubits encoded with the surface code can be in different phases of their syndrome generation cycle, thereby introducing desynchronization in the system. This can occur due to the production of non-Clifford states, dropouts due to fabrication defects, and the use of other QEC codes with the surface code to reduce resource requirements. Logical operations require the syndrome generation cycles of the logical qubits involved to be synchronized. This requires the leading qubit to pause or slow down its cycle, allowing more errors to accumulate before the next cycle, thereby increasing the risk of uncorrectable errors.
  To synchronize the syndrome generation cycles of logical qubits, we define three policies - Passive, Active, and Hybrid. The Passive policy is the baseline, and the simplest, wherein the leading logical qubits idle until they are synchronized with the remaining logical qubits. On the other hand, the Active policy aims to slow the leading logical qubits down gradually, by inserting short idle periods before multiple code cycles. This approach reduces the logical error rate (LER) by up to 2.4x compared to the Passive policy. The Hybrid policy further reduces the LER by up to 3.4x by reducing the synchronization slack and running a few additional rounds of error correction. Furthermore, the reduction in the logical error rate with the proposed synchronization policies enables a speedup in decoding latency of up to 2.2x with a circuit-level noise model.</description>

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation, uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework, advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Time-Symmetric Quantum Algorithm for Direct Eigenstate Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time symmetry in quantum mechanics, where the current quantum state is determined jointly by both the past and the future, offers a more comprehensive description of physical phenomena. This symmetry facilitates both forward and backward time evolution, providing a computational advantage over methods that rely on a fixed time direction. In this work, we present a nonvariational and \textit{time-symmetric quantum algorithm} for addressing the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian, leveraging the coherence between forward and backward time evolution. Our approach enables the simultaneous determination of both the ground state and the highest excited state, as well as the direct identification of arbitrary eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm eliminates the need for prior computation of lower eigenstates, allowing for the direct extraction of any eigenstate and energy bandwidth while avoiding error accumulation. Its non-variational nature ensures convergence to target states without encountering the barren plateau problem. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the non-unitary evolution using both the linear combination of unitaries and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Our algorithm is applied to compute the energy bandwidth and spectrum of various molecular systems, as well as to identify topological states in condensed matter systems, including the Kane-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We anticipate that this algorithm will provide an efficient solution for eigenvalue problems, particularly in distinguishing quantum phases and calculating energy bands.</description>

      <title>Sequential transmission at short times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to transmit and preserve information at short time scales over an n-fold composition of quantum channels $(\Xi^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ modelled as a discrete quantum Markov semigroup, long enough to generate entanglement at some finite $n$. This is achieved by interspersing the action of noise with quantum error correction in succession. We show this by means of a non-trivial lower bound on the one-shot quantum capacity in the sequential setting as a function of $n$, in an attempt to model a linear quantum network and assess its capabilities to distribute entanglement. Intriguingly, the rate of transmission of such a network turns out to be a property of the spectrum of the channels composed in sequence, and the maximum possible error in transmission can be bounded as a function of the noise model only. As an application, we derive an exact error bound for the infinite dimensional pure-loss channel believed to be the dominant source of noise in networks precluding the distribution of entanglement. We exemplify our results by analysing the amplitude damping channel and its bosonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>On a dynamic ontic wave model of quantum collapse and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel model of quantum entities as physical, spatially extended wavefields, forming the basis for a realist framework for quantum measurement and collapse. Unlike interpretations that postulate hidden variables, observer-induced effects, ad hoc stochastic elements, or multiverse branching, this model derives the Born rule as the natural consequence of local physical interactions acting on an extended wavefield. Central to the model is a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle-not as a statistical or epistemic limitation, but as a dynamical relation between kinetic energy input and wavefield contraction. This framework yields testable predictions about how weak, intermediate, and strong quantum interactions modulate spatial localization-predictions consistent with existing experimental findings. The upshot is a simple, unified, and empirically grounded alternative to prevailing interpretations, which provides a foundation for a broader research program in what is here termed wavefield interaction mechanics.</description>

      <title>QSEA: Quantum Self-supervised Learning with Entanglement Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an unsupervised feature representation paradigm, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) uses the intrinsic structure of data to extract meaningful features without relying on manual annotation. Despite the success of SSL, there are still problems, such as limited model capacity or insufficient representation ability. Quantum SSL has become a promising alternative because it can exploit quantum states to enhance expression ability and learning efficiency. This letter proposes a Quantum SSL with entanglement augmentation method (QSEA). Different from existing Quantum SSLs, QSEA introduces an entanglement-based sample generation scheme and a fidelity-driven quantum loss function. Specifically, QSEA constructs augmented samples by entangling an auxiliary qubit with the raw state and applying parameterized unitary transformations. The loss function is defined using quantum fidelity, quantifying similarity between quantum representations and effectively capturing sample relations. Experimental results show that QSEA outperforms existing quantum self-supervised methods on multiple benchmarks and shows stronger stability in decorrelation noise environments. This framework lays the theoretical and practical foundation for quantum learning systems and advances the development of quantum machine learning in SSL.</description>

      <title>Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory for simulating open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Unit Testing for Quantum Subroutines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software testing is a critical component of the classical software development lifecycle, and this principle is expected to hold true for quantum software as it evolves toward large-scale production and adherence to industry standards. Developing and testing quantum software presents unique challenges due to the non-deterministic nature of quantum information, the high dimensionality of the underlying Hilbert space, complex hardware noise, and the inherent non-local properties of quantum systems. In this work, we model quantum subroutines as parametrized quantum channels and explore the feasibility of creating practical unit tests using probabilistic assertions, combined with either quantum tomography or statistical tests. To address the computational complexity associated with unit testing in quantum systems, we propose incorporating context-awareness into the testing process. The trade-offs between accuracy, state space coverage, and efficiency associated with the proposed theoretical framework for quantum unit testing have been demonstrated through its application to a simple three-qubit quantum subroutine that prepares a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, as well as to subroutines within a program implementing Shor's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that embeds the Schr\"{o}dinger equation directly into the machine learning procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit in certain settings and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing brightness of SPDC source in Laguerre-Gaussian modes using type-0 periodically-poled nonlinear crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit entanglement in the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode basis, which enables high-dimensional free-space quantum communication by exploiting the high-dimensional space spanned by the LG modes. For such free-space quantum communication, the brightness of the quantum light source plays an important role due to the atmospheric turbulence and photon loss. A variety of studies have analyzed the SPDC brightness by decomposing biphoton states into LG modes, but they have often relied on a degenerate state, a narrow spectral bandwidth approximation, or a thin crystal approximation. However, these approaches are unsuitable for non-degenerate type-0 SPDC with a periodicallypoled nonlinear crystal, which offers higher brightness due to its superior nonlinear coefficients. In this study, we examine the spectrum of photon pairs in specific LG modes generated by a type-0 ppKTP crystal whileavoiding the constraints imposed by the aforementioned assumptions. In addition, we investigate the optimal focal parameters of the pump, signal, and idler to maximize the brightness for a given LG mode. Our findings show that it is not feasible to simultaneously optimize the brightness for different LG modes with a single pump focal parameter. The results of this study provide a comprehensive framework for developing highbrightness quantum light sources and contribute to the advancement of high-dimensional free-space quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions between two-level emitters mediated by time-dependent, one-dimensional, structured photonic baths, focusing on Floquet topological lattices. Building on the framework of periodically driven photonic lattices, we demonstrate and characterize the emergence of tunable-range emitter's interactions mediated by bound states absent in static photonic lattices. In particular, we show that one can not only obtain different spatial interaction dependencies with respect to the static bath scenarios, but also in qualitatively different regimes due to the time-dependent nature of the bath, for example, when the emitters have different frequencies. This work sheds light on the interplay between non-equilibrium photonics and quantum optics and can serve as the basis for analyzing Floquet photonic lattices in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh threshold nonstabilizer nonlinear quantum error correcting code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel type of quantum error correcting code, called the spinor code, based on spaces defined by total spin. The code is a nonstabilizer code, and is also a nonlinear quantum error correcting code, meaning that quantum information is encoded in a parameterized family of quantum states, rather than a linear superposition of code words. Syndrome measurements are performed by projecting on states with differing total spin, with an associated correction to map states back to the maximum total spin space. We show that the code is asymptotically capable of protecting against any single qubit Pauli error for Gaussian distributed states such as spin coherent state. We directly evaluate the performance under the depolarizing channel, considering various cases, with and without initialization and measurement errors, as well as two qubit errors. We estimate the code-capacity threshold to be in the range of 32-75%, while the phenomenological threshold is in the range 9-75%.</description>

      <title>Time-domain field correlation measurements enable tomography of highly multimode quantum states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in ultrafast optics facilitates the investigation of the dynamics of highly multimode quantum states of light, as demonstrated by the application of electro-optic sampling to quantum states of the electromagnetic field. Yet, the complete tomographic reconstruction of optical quantum states with prior unknown statistics and dynamics is still challenging, since state-of-the-art tomographic methods require the measurement of many orthogonal, distinguishable modes. Here, we propose a tomography scheme based on time-domain quadrature correlation measurements and theoretically demonstrate its ability to reconstruct highly multimode Gaussian states. In contrast to (eight-port) homodyne detection, the two local oscillator pulses are shorter in time and are (independently) time-delayed against the pulsed quantum state. The distinguishable mode structure is obtained in post-processing from the correlation measurement data by orthogonalization. We show that the number of reconstructable modes increases with the number of time delays used and decreases with the temporal extent of the local oscillator. We extend and optimise our proposed correlation measurement to electro-optic sampling by adding a nonlinear crystal prior to the homodyne detection, potentially achieving subcycle resolution in the mid-infrared to THz regime. By analysing the (quantum) correlations present in the measurement data, we show how thermalisation of the quantum state during detection leads to the requirement of correlation measurements. The thermalisation is especially pronounced in the strong squeezing limit, for which we developed a non-perturbative theory. Furthermore, we open an avenue to extending our tomography scheme to non-Gaussian states by theoretically establishing the complete measurement statistics and showing how to obtain spectral information about pulsed Fock states from the joint statistics.</description>

      <title>Overtone Rabi oscillation of optically polarized triplet electron spins and nuclear hyperpolarization in powder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report coherent overtone Rabi oscillations of optically-polarized triplet electron spins and nuclear hyperpolarization in powder samples at room temperature. The strong orientation dependence through the zero-field splitting (ZFS) interaction in the single-quantum transition is overcome by coherently driving the significantly narrower overtone transition. Analytical formulas for the overtone lineshape and nutation functions for axially symmetric ZFS interactions are derived. Overtone Rabi oscillations are observed in pentacene-doped \textit{p}-terphenyl and NV$^-$ centers in microdiamonds. For the former, overtone triplet dynamic nuclear polarization using the integrated solid effect leads to a $^1$H nuclear spin polarization of $0.183\pm0.005$\% at a magnetic field of 0.2 T. The $^1$H NMR polarization is enhanced by 2600-fold with respect to thermal equilibrium and reaches a large portion of the randomly oriented microcrystals.</description>

      <title>Unitary Scrambling and Collapse: A Quantum Diffusion Framework for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, with its promise of exponential speedups, is rapidly emerging as a powerful paradigm for advancing artificial intelligence. We propose QSC-Diffusion, the first fully quantum diffusion-based framework for image generation. Our method integrates classical Gaussian noise with quantum scrambling in the forward process, and employs parameterized quantum circuits with measurement-induced collapse for reverse denoising -- enabling end-to-end sampling without reliance on classical neural architectures or preprocessing modules. To address optimization challenges in deep quantum models, we introduce a hybrid loss that balances fidelity and diversity, coupled with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to mitigate barren plateaus. Remarkably, QSC-Diffusion achieves competitive FID scores across multiple datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters, outperforming even some quantum-classical hybrid baselines in efficiency. These results highlight the potential of quantum-native generative modeling and mark a foundational step toward scalable quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Quantum control of single x-ray photons can be achieved using thin-film nanostructure cavities with embedded layers of resonant nuclei. Here, we design and theoretically investigate tailored cavity structures that implement a non-Hermitian version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger one-dimensional topological model. By tuning the geometry of the structure, different topological phases can be realized. We show that the presence of topological edge states can be identified in the reflectivity spectra of the thin-film cavities. Our findings pave the way for exploiting topological phases in x-ray quantum control.</description>

      <title>Experimental Verification of Entangled States in the Adversarial Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient verification of entangled states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, the effectiveness of standard quantum state verification (QSV) is based on the condition of independent and identical distribution (IID), which impedes its applications in many practical scenarios. Here we demonstrate a defensive QSV protocol, which is effective in all kinds of non-IID scenarios, including the extremely challenging adversarial scenario. To this end, we build a high-speed preparation-and-measurement apparatus controlled by quantum random-number generators. Our experiments clearly show that standard QSV protocols often provide unreliable fidelity certificates in non-IID scenarios. In sharp contrast, the defensive QSV protocol based on a homogeneous strategy can provide reliable and nearly tight fidelity certificates at comparable high efficiency, even under malicious attacks. Moreover, our scheme is robust against the imperfections in a realistic experiment, which is very appealing to practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Mechanical Pendulum Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an optomechanical system as a model of an autonomous mechanical pendulum clock in the quantum regime, whose operation relies only on incoherent (thermal) resources. The escapement of the clock, the mechanism that translates oscillatory motion into ticks, is provided by an emitter in the optical cavity and the operation of the clock relies on the existence of a limit cycle. Since the clock is based on an oscillatory degree of freedom, it can overcome the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and is thus more accurate than clocks that rely only on stochastic transitions. Furthermore, by increasing the amount of emitters in the cavity, the clock approaches the behavior expected for a macroscopic pendulum clock, where fluctuations become irrelevant while the clock dynamics becomes completely irreversible. This allows for investigating the quantum-to-classical transition of pendulum clocks.</description>

      <title>Coherent states of finite-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for constructing coherent states (CS) of finite-level systems with a given angular momentum is proposed. To this end we generalize the known spin equation (SE) to an infinite-dimensional Fock space. The equation describes a special quadratic system in the latter space. Its projections on $d$-dimensional subspaces, represent analogs of SE for $d$-dimensional systems in an external electromagnetic field which describe $d$-dimensional systems with a given angular moment. Using a modification of Malkin-Manko method developed in our earlier work, we construct the corresponding CS for the total quadratic system. Projections of the later CS on finite-dimensional subspaces we call angular moment CS (AMCS) of finite-level systems. The AMCS have a clear physical meaning, they obey the Schr\"odinger for a $d$-dimensional system with a given angular moment $j=\left(d-1\right)/2$ in an external electromagnetic field. Their possible exact solutions are constructed via exact solutions of the SE in $2$-dimensional space. The latter solutions can be found analytically and are completely described in our earlier works. A one subset of AMCS can be related to Perelomov spinning CS (PSCS). This reflects the fact that the set of possible AMCS is wider than the set of PSCS. AMCS states in a constant magnetic field are constructed. Some of them coincide with the Bloch CS.</description>

      <title>Observation of High-Order Quantum Pancharatnam-Berry Phase with Structured Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a quantum system evolves so that it returns to its initial state, it will acquire a geometric phase acting as a memory of the transformation of a physical system, which has been experimentally measured in a variety of physical systems. In optics, the most prominent example is the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase. Recent technological advances in phase and polarization structure have led to the discovery of high-order PB phases with structured light fields. The study on the high-order PB phase is limited in the context of elementary quantum states of light, especially in the case of photon number states. Here, we experimentally investigate the differences of high-order PB phases between single-photon and N00N states. Our results show that the PB phase, like the dynamic phase, can also be doubled under two-photon states, which can greatly improve the phase sensitivity for greater $N$ in N00N states and high-order structured photons. This may show some implications for quantum precision measurement and quantum state engineering based on geometric phase.</description>

      <title>Saturable nonlinearity induced quantum correlations in optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme that induces quantum correlations in optomtomechanical systems. Our benchmark system consists of two optically coupled optical cavities which interact with a common mechanical resonator. The optical cavities host saturable nonlinearity which triggers either gain or losses in each cavity. Without these nonlinearities, there are no quantum correlations, i.e., entanglement and steering, generated in the system. By turning on the nonlinearities, gain and losses are switched on, enabling flexible generation of both quantum entanglement and quantum steering in our proposal. These generated quantum correlations seem to be insensitive to the induced gain, while the induced losses through saturation effect efficiently enhance quantum correlations. Moreover, the robustness of the generated quantum correlations against thermal fluctuations is further improved under nonlinear saturation scenario. This work suggests a way of using nonlinear saturation effects to engineer quantum correlations even at room temperature, which are useful for quantum information processing, quantum computational tasks, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Universal gates for a metastable qubit in strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable atomic qubits are a highly promising platform for the realization of quantum computers, owing to their scalability and the possibility of converting leakage errors to erasure errors mid-circuit. Here, we demonstrate and characterize a universal gate set for the metastable fine-structure qubit encoded between the $^3\text{P}_0$ and $^3\text{P}_2$ states in bosonic strontium-88. We find single-qubit gate fidelities of 0.993(1), and two-qubit gate fidelities of 0.9945(6) after correcting for losses during the gate operation. Furthermore, we present a novel state-resolved detection scheme for the two fine-structure states that enables high-fidelity detection of qubit loss. Finally, we leverage the existence of a stable ground state outside the qubit subspace to perform mid-circuit erasure conversion using fast destructive imaging. Our results establish the strontium fine-structure qubit as a promising candidate for near-term error-corrected quantum computers, offering unique scaling perspectives.</description>

      <title>Certification of quantum networks using the generalised Choi isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for certifying entanglement properties of quantum states and measurements in line networks. The framework is based on the generalised Choi isomorphism, which can be used to map bipartite states and measurements into corresponding quantum operations. We apply the method to networks with trusted end points to demonstrate the power of the approach. We derive bounds for common convex geometric entanglement quantifiers of individual source states, as well as for the network as a whole. We also apply the technique to certification of entanglement dimensionality, proposing the concept of Schmidt number for bipartite measurements in the process. We believe this quantifier can find interest in benchmarking detectors used, e.g. in qutrit teleportation. Applying our formalism further to high-dimensional networks, we derive an activation result for genuinely high-dimensional quantum steering.</description>

      <title>Explicit C*-algebraic Protocol for Exact Universal Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a universal embezzlement protocol in the C*-algebraic model of quantum information, that is equivalent to the commuting operator model. Our protocol enables exact embezzlement of arbitrary bipartite pure states using a single, fixed catalyst state. Unlike prior constructions that achieve only approximate embezzlement or require state-dependent catalysts, our approach is both exact and state-independent. The construction is explicit, based on simple *-automorphisms acting locally on infinite tensor products of CAR algebras with the underlying idea of the Hilbert hotel. In the dense-state case, the protocol naturally recovers the Type III_1 factor via the GNS construction, consistent with recent classification results. We further extend the construction to allow exact embezzlement of all states, at the cost of working with a non-separable C*-algebra. Despite the increase in algebraic size, the operational structure remains simple and localized. This offers a conceptually intuitive model for universal entanglement embezzlement in infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Comparing probability distributions: application to quantum states of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probability distributions play a central role in quantum mechanics, and even more so in quantum optics with its rich diversity of theoretically conceivable and experimentally accessible quantum states of light. Quantifiers that compare two different states or density matrices in terms of `distances' between the respective probability distributions include the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{\rm KL}$, the Bhattacharyya distance $D_{\rm B}$, and the $p$-Wasserstein distance $W_{p}$. We present a novel application of these notions to a variety of photon states, focusing particularly on the $p=1$ Wasserstein distance $W_{1}$ as it is a proper distance measure in the space of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek dynamical scaling hypothesis in the Google analog-digital quantum simulator of the $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the 2D square-lattice $XX$ model [Nature 638, 79 (2025)]. We focus on the quantum Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism near the quantum critical point. Using the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions.</description>

Abstract: By using the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, we propose a well-defined coherence measure of quantum channels based on the generalized $\alpha$-$z$-relative R\'{e}nyi entropy. In addition, we present an alternative coherence measure of quantum channels by quantifying the commutativity between the channels and the completely dephasing channels with the generalized $\alpha$-$z$-relative R\'{e}nyi entropy. Some elegant properties of the measures are illustrated in detail. Explicit formulas of these coherence measures are derived for some detailed typical quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Constructing Quantum Many-Body Scars from Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exotic many-body states that exhibit anomalous non-thermal behavior in an otherwise ergodic system. In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable and intuitive construction of QMBS in a kinetically constrained quantum model exhibiting weak Hilbert space fragmentation. We show that towers of exact QMBS can be constructed by injecting a quasiparticle excitation that partially activates the frozen regions in the lattice. Meanwhile, the inelastic collision between multiple quasiparticles allows for the construction of approximate scars, whose damping is governed by an emergent two-body loss. Our findings establish direct connections between quantum many-body scarring and Hilbert space fragmentation, paving the way for systematically constructing exact and approximate QMBS. The proposed model can be readily implemented in neutral-atom quantum simulators aided by strong Rydberg interactions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Fate of Continuously Monitored Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum trajectory is the natural response of a quantum system subject to external perturbations due to continuous indirect measurement. We completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored quantum systems in finite dimensions and show that generically, spontaneous irreversible localization transitions on the level of individual realizations occur, where the evolution becomes effectively constrained to one of the irreducible components of the total Hilbert space. More generally, localization can be either complete, where the strongest possible confinement is achieved, or incomplete, where localization terminates prematurely. On the trajectory level, symmetries and conserved quantities are no longer respected and localization transitions occur concurrently with violations of ergodicity. As a result, a generalized update rule emerges that effectively projects the system onto one of several possible time evolutions. The update comes equipped with a generalized Born rule that assigns probabilities to these irreversible events. Spontaneous transitions thus occur probabilistically and can deviate considerably from the behavior of the ensemble. In particular, time and ensemble average no longer commute which gives rise to global violations of ergodicity, while on a local level, ergodicity is restored. We explicitly illustrate the asymptotic behavior of continuously monitored systems in a series of examples demonstrating stabilization of many-body scar states and generation of Bell states from local measurement. Finally, we present two algorithms, one based on simultaneous block diagonalization and one based on quantum trajectories to identify all the minimal orthogonal subspaces of the Lindblad equation and all the extremal stationary states which are supported on them.</description>

      <title>Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environment in the quantum regime where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions. Furthermore, we review the recent exploration toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also review the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</description>

Abstract: We present a three-node quantum communication testbed with a triangular topology, each side of the triangle formed by a 1.3-meter-long transmission line. We demonstrate state transfer and entanglement generation between any two nodes, generate genuine multipartite entangled GHZ states, and implement quantum secret sharing (QSS) of classical information. Our experiments show that the QSS protocol can effectively detect eavesdropping, ensuring the secure sharing of secrets. This device forms a testbed for robust and secure quantum networking, enabling testing of more advanced quantum communication protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including cavity-resolved readout into a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for future networking applications. This platform is species-agnostic and scalable, and we expect key metrics to further improve in a next-generation realization anticipated to be compatible with glass-cell-based experiments. Our work unlocks, for the first time, the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian dynamics on a cube: improving quantum compilation through qudit-based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in mapping lattice gauge theories relevant to the Standard Model onto digital quantum computers identify scalable paths with well-defined quantum compilation challenges toward the continuum. As an entry point to these challenges, we address the simulation of SU(2) lattice gauge theory. Using qudit registers to encode the digitized gauge field, we provide quantum resource estimates, in terms of elementary qudit gates, for arbitrarily high local gauge field truncations. We then demonstrate an end-to-end simulation of real-time, qutrit-digitized SU(2) dynamics on a cube. Through optimizing the simulation, we improved circuit decompositions for uniformly-controlled qudit rotations, an algorithmic primitive for general applications of quantum computing. The decompositions also apply to mixed-dimensional qudit systems, which we found advantageous for compiling lattice gauge theory simulations. Furthermore, we parallelize the evolution of opposite faces in anticipation of similar opportunities arising in three-dimensional lattice volumes. This work details an ambitious executable for future qudit hardware and attests to the value of codesign strategies between lattice gauge theory simulation and quantum compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we take a closer look at the algebraic-operator correspondence between the momentum ($k$) space and the position ($x$) space which gives us the form of the momentum operator in position space and vice versa in Quantum Mechanics. Taking the definition of the Fourier Transform as the starting point, we present a two parameter generalisation of the form of the momentum operator in position space followed by a generalisation of the momentum eigenfunctions and a few other results. It is also seen that the results obtained here have a well defined limit to the standard results of Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Detection with Sub-eV Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution transition-edge sensors (TESs) as a quantum sensing platform for detecting dark matter (DM). Operating near the thermodynamic noise limit with sub-eV energy resolution, TESs offer a powerful approach for probing light DM in the sub-GeV mass range. Optical TESs, realized on superconducting films with critical temperatures below 150 mK, achieve energy thresholds below 100 meV and enable precise calorimetric detection of individual energy depositions. We model TES response by incorporating fundamental noise sources and applying optimal filtering techniques, and evaluate their sensitivity across a range of DM interaction channels, accounting for in-medium effects in the target material. We show that even ng-month-scale exposures can reach previously unexplored DM-electron scattering cross sections below $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV masses, and can probe the MeV-scale mass range for DM-nucleon couplings. Combining high energy resolution, photon-number sensitivity, and scalability, optical TESs provide a compelling quantum sensing platform for rare-event searches at the intersection of particle physics and quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-entropy and dihedral measures are a class of tractable measures for multi-partite entanglement, which are labeled by the R\'enyi index (or replica number) $n$ as in the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that these quantities are new useful probes of quantum critical points by examining concrete examples. In particular, we compute the multi-entropy and dihedral measures in the $1+1$ dimensional massless free scalar field theory on a lattice and in the transverse-field Ising model. For $n=2$, we find that the numerical results in both lattice theories quantitatively agree with those from conformal field theoretic calculations. For $n=3$ and $n=4$, we provide new predictions of these measures for the massless scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Like a coin spinning in the air: the effect of (non-)metaphorical explanations on comprehension and attitudes towards quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of the science underlying quantum technology may pose a barrier to its democratization. This study investigated whether metaphors improve comprehension of, and shape attitudes toward, quantum technology. In an online experiment (n = 1,167 participants representative of the Dutch population), participants read a news article that included a metaphorical, non-metaphorical, or no explanation of a quantum phenomenon. Both explanation types reduced perceived comprehension of the news article compared to the control group, but increased actual comprehension of the quantum phenomenon. No direct effects were found on affect-based or cognition-based attitudes. Mediation analyses revealed a very small negative indirect effect of explanations on attitudes, through lower perceived comprehension, and a very small positive indirect effect of explanations on attitudes via increased actual comprehension - though the latter was counteracted by a negative direct effect. As metaphors offered no additional benefit over non-metaphorical explanations, the findings suggest they do not provide a communicative advantage for enhancing understanding or shaping attitudes in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of Hawking radiation induced by the quantum atmosphere beyond the event horizon, by considering two detectors in Schwarzschild spacetime with the parameterized Hartle-Hawking temperature. \textcolor{black}{We explicitly study the dynamics of quantum entanglement and found that its characteristics are closely correlated with Hawking quantum radiation beyond the event horizon. Namely, its minimal value corresponds to the peak of Hawking radiation.} By virtue of the mutual information, we demonstrate the complementary relationship of the information distribution in the black hole. In addition, we detailedly discuss the influence of distance from the center of black hole to particle, radius of event horizon and Hartle-Hawking constant on the entropy uncertainty in the current scenario, and the results interestingly show that there exists an opposite correlation between the entanglement and the entropy uncertainty. It is believed that our observation could provide a new perspective for understanding the black hole information paradox and black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Reaching the Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [arXiv:2403.02279v3; Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarizationtensor. According to these authors, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". To bring the predictions of quantum field theory in agreement with those following from the Kubo model, the modified expression was used which relates the conductivity and the polarization tensor. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Job Scheduling in Quantum Clouds Using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present-day quantum systems face critical bottlenecks, including limited qubit counts, brief coherence intervals, and high susceptibility to errors-all of which obstruct the execution of large and complex circuits. The advancement of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally, inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing, retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics, including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs. Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Electric Quadrupole Moment-Induced Parity Doubling in Molecules for Symmetry-Violation Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM) and nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have high discovery potential for violations of time ($T$) and parity ($P$) reversal symmetries beyond the Standard Model. Molecules containing heavy nuclei are typically used to enhance the sensitivity to MQMs and NSMs due to their strong internal electric fields and potential octupole deformation. To extract these effects in the laboratory frame, a bias electric field is required to polarize the molecule by mixing states of opposite parity (parity doublets). Typical heavy nuclei that are sensitive to symmetry-violation also possess large nuclear electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) when its nuclear spin is $I\geq1$. We show that EQMs can significantly modify the energy splitting between parity doublet states and thus change the required polarizing electric field. As a result, the EQM-induced energy splitting must be taken into account in designing such experiments. We provide qualitative estimates of parity doubling from EQMs and supporting \textit{ab initio} calculations, along with implications for candidate molecules in symmetry-violation searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study two-point correlation functions of modular Hamiltonians. We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a quantum battery system under both external driving and dissipation. The system consists of a coupled two-level charger and battery immersed in nonequilibrium fermionic reservoirs. By considering the changes in the energy spectrum induced by external driving and charger-battery coupling in a non-perturbative manner, we go beyond the secular approximation to derive the Redfield master equation. In the nonequilibrium scenario, both charging efficiency and power of the quantum battery can be optimized through a compensation mechanism. When the charger and battery are off-resonance, a significant chemical potential difference between the reservoirs, which characterizes the degree of nonequilibrium, plays a crucial role. Specifically, the charger's frequency should be higher (lower) than that of the battery when the average chemical potential is negative (positive) to achieve enhanced charging efficiency and power under strong nonequilibrium conditions. Remarkably, the efficiency in the nonequilibrium case can surpass that in the equilibrium setup. Moreover, we find no positive correlation between entanglement and efficiency, challenging the prevailing assumption that entanglement necessarily enhances the performance of quantum devices. Our results provide insights into the design and optimization of quantum batteries in nonequilibrium open systems.</description>

      <title>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</title>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</description>

      <title>How much entanglement is needed for quantum error correction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that logical states of quantum error-correcting codes have to be highly entangled such that codes capable of correcting more errors require more entanglement to encode a qubit. Here, we show that the validity of this belief depends on the specific code and the choice of entanglement measure. To this end, we characterize a tradeoff between the code distance $d$ quantifying the number of correctable errors, and the geometric entanglement measure of logical states quantifying their maximal overlap with product states or more general ``topologically trivial" states. The maximum overlap is shown to be exponentially small in $d$ for three families of codes: (1) low-density parity check codes with commuting check operators, (2) stabilizer codes, and (3) codes with a constant encoding rate. Equivalently, the geometric entanglement of any logical state of these codes grows at least linearly with $d$. On the opposite side, we also show that this distance-entanglement tradeoff does not hold in general. For any constant $d$ and $k$ (number of logical qubits), we show there exists a family of codes such that the geometric entanglement of some logical states approaches zero in the limit of large code length.</description>

      <title>Calculating response functions of coupled oscillators using quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating frequency response functions of systems of coupled, classical harmonic oscillators using a quantum computer. The functional form of these response functions can be mapped to a corresponding eigenproblem of a Hermitian matrix $H$, thus suggesting the use of quantum phase estimation. Our proposed quantum algorithm operates in the standard $s$-sparse, oracle-based query access model. For a network of $N$ oscillators with maximum norm $\lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}$, and when the eigenvalue tolerance $\varepsilon$ is much smaller than the minimum eigenvalue gap, we use $\mathcal{O}(\log(N s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/\varepsilon)$ algorithmic qubits and obtain a rigorous worst-case query complexity upper bound $\mathcal{O}(s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/(\delta^2 \varepsilon) )$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\delta$ denotes the desired precision on the coefficients appearing in the response functions. Crucially, our proposal does not suffer from the infamous state preparation bottleneck and can as such potentially achieve large quantum speedups compared to relevant classical methods. As a proof-of-principle of exponential quantum speedup, we show that a simple adaptation of our algorithm solves the random glued-trees problem in polynomial time. We discuss practical limitations as well as potential improvements for quantifying finite size, end-to-end complexities for application to relevant instances.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gouy Rotation of Electron Vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic rotation of electron vortex beams, governed by their phase structure, has been experimentally observed in magnetic fields by breaking the beam's cylindrical symmetry. However, conventional Landau states, which predict three fixed angular frequencies, cannot fully account for the existing experimental observations. To address this limitation, we introduce and derive the generalized Gouy rotation angle, which links the Gouy phase of an extended Landau state -- featuring a periodically oscillating beam width -- to the experimentally observed angular variation. In particular, this framework predicts a broader spectrum of angular frequencies and captures the reversal of rotation direction observed in electron vortex beams with negative topological charge. Calculations based on experimental parameters show good agreement with previously published data and are further validated here by numerical simulations using the Chebyshev method. Our results are, in principle, applicable to any system involving electron vortex beams in uniform magnetic fields, and provide a foundation for exploring vortex electrons in Glaser and other nonuniform magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation of Electronic Structure with Projector Augmented-Wave Method and Plane Wave Basis Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of materials is a promising application area of quantum computers. To practically realize this promise, we must reduce quantum resources while maintaining accuracy. In electronic structure calculations on classical computers, resource reduction has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. However, the PAW method generalized for many-body states introduces non-orthogonality effects which impede its direct application to quantum computing. In this work, we develop a unitary variant of the PAW (UPAW) that preserves the orthogonality constraints. We provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition of the UPAW Hamiltonian to enable ground state estimation using qubitized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we further improve algorithmic efficiency by extending classical down-sampling techniques into the quantum setting. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.</description>

Abstract: Efficient state preparation is essential for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. Whilst several techniques for low-cost state preparation exist, this work facilitates further classes of states, whose amplitudes are well approximated by piecewise polynomials. We show how such states can be efficiently prepared using a piecewise Quantum Singular Value Transformation along with a new piecewise linear diagonal block encoding. We illustrate this with the explicit examples of $x^\alpha|x\rangle$ and $\log x|x\rangle$. Further, our technique reduces the cost of window boosted Quantum Phase Estimation by efficiently preparing the B-spline window state. We demonstrate this window state requires 50 times fewer Toffolis to prepare than the state-of-the-art Kaiser window state, and we show that the B-spline window replicates the Kaiser window's exponential reduction in tail probability for QPE.</description>

      <title>Weaver: A Retargetable Compiler Framework for FPQA Quantum Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the prominent quantum computing architectures are based on superconducting technology, new quantum hardware technologies are emerging, such as Trapped Ions, Neutral Atoms (or FPQAs), Silicon Spin Qubits, etc. This diverse set of technologies presents fundamental trade-offs in terms of scalability, performance, manufacturing, and operating expenses. To manage these diverse quantum technologies, there is a growing need for a retargetable compiler that can efficiently adapt existing code to these emerging hardware platforms. Such a retargetable compiler must be extensible to support new and rapidly evolving technologies, performant with fast compilation times and high-fidelity execution, and verifiable through rigorous equivalence checking to ensure the functional equivalence of the retargeted code.
  To this end, we present $Weaver$, the first extensible, performant, and verifiable retargetable quantum compiler framework with a focus on FPQAs due to their unique, promising features. $Weaver$ introduces WQASM, the first formal extension of the standard OpenQASM quantum assembly with FPQA-specific instructions to support their distinct capabilities. Next, $Weaver$ implements the WOptimizer, an extensible set of FPQA-specific optimization passes to improve execution quality. Last, the WChecker automatically checks for equivalence between the original and the retargeted code. Our evaluation shows that $Weaver$ improves compilation times by $10^3\times$, execution times by $4.4\times$, and execution fidelity by $10\%$, on average, compared to superconducting and state-of-the-art (non-retargetable) FPQA compilers.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithm for calculating eigenvalues of differential operators and its application to estimating the decay rate of the perturbation distribution tail in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for scientific computing and their applications have been studied actively. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for estimating the first eigenvalue of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and its application to cosmic inflation theory. A common approach for this eigenvalue problem involves applying the finite-difference discretization to $\mathcal{L}$ and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, but this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, namely the exponential complexity with respect to $d$. Our first contribution is the development of a new quantum algorithm for this task, leveraging recent quantum singular value transformation-based methods. Given a trial function that overlaps well with the eigenfunction, our method runs with query complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ with $d$ and estimation accuracy $\epsilon$, which is polynomial in $d$ and shows an improvement over existing quantum algorithms. Then, we consider the application of our method to a problem in a theoretical framework for cosmic inflation known as stochastic inflation, specifically calculating the eigenvalue of the adjoint Fokker--Planck operator, which is related to the decay rate of the tail of the probability distribution for the primordial density perturbation. We numerically see that in some cases, simple trial functions overlap well with the first eigenfunction, indicating our method is promising for this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical approach to design highly efficient adiabatic schedules for analog quantum computing, focusing on the maximum-independent-set problem and neutral atom platforms. On the basis of a representative dataset of small graphs, we present numerical evidence that the optimum schedules depend principally on the hardness of the problem rather than on its size. These schedules perform better than the benchmark protocols and admit a straightforward implementation in the hardware. This allows us to extrapolate the results to larger graphs and to successfully solve moderately hard problems using QuEra's 256-qubit Aquila computer. We believe that extending our approach to hybrid algorithms could be the key to solving the hardest instances with the current technology, making yet another step toward real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) promises simultaneous data queries at multiple memory locations, with data retrieved in coherent superpositions, essential for achieving quantum speedup in many quantum algorithms. We introduce a transmon-controlled phonon router and propose a QRAM implementation by connecting these routers in a tree-like architecture. The router controls the motion of itinerant surface acoustic wave phonons based on the state of the control transmon, implementing the core functionality of conditional routing for QRAM. Our QRAM design is compact, supports fast routing operations, and avoids frequency crowding. Additionally, we propose a hybrid dual-rail encoding method to detect dominant loss errors without additional hardware, a versatile approach applicable to other QRAM platforms. Our estimates indicate that the proposed QRAM platform can achieve high heralding rates using current device parameters, with heralding fidelity primarily limited by transmon dephasing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum noise in real-world devices poses a significant challenge in achieving practical quantum advantage, since accurately compiled and executed circuits are typically deep and highly susceptible to decoherence. To facilitate the implementation of complex quantum algorithms on noisy hardware, we propose an approximate method for compiling target quantum circuits into brick-wall layouts. This new circuit design consists of two-qubit CNOT gates that can be directly implemented on real quantum computers, in conjunction with optimized one-qubit gates, to approximate the essential dynamics of the original circuit while significantly reducing its depth. Our approach is evaluated through numerical simulations of time-evolution circuits for the critical Ising model, quantum Fourier transformation, and Haar-random quantum circuits, as well as experiments on IBM quantum platforms. By accounting for compilation error and circuit noise, we demonstrate that time evolution and quantum Fourier transformation circuits achieve high compression rates, while random quantum circuits are less compressible. The degree of compression is related to the rate of entanglement accumulation in the target circuit. In particular, experiments on IBM platforms achieve a compression rate of $12.5$ for $N=12$, significantly extending the application of current quantum devices. Furthermore, large-scale numerical simulations for system sizes up to $N=30$ reveal that the optimal depth $d_{\rm max}$ to achieve maximal overall fidelity is independent of system size $N$, suggesting the scalability of our method for large quantum devices in terms of quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Mitigating shot noise in local overlapping quantum tomography with semidefinite programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced density matrices (RDMs) are fundamental in quantum information processing, allowing the computation of local observables, such as energy and correlation functions, without the exponential complexity of fully characterizing quantum states. In the context of near-term quantum computing, RDMs provide sufficient information to effectively design variational quantum algorithms. However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it involves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases--a resource-intensive process susceptible to producing non-physical RDMs due to shot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to mitigate shot noise by re-enforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs. While verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is quantum Merlin-Arthur complete, we relax this condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level using a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs from simulated data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter bounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without compatibility constraints. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our method by integrating it into an algorithmic cooling procedure to prepare low-energy states of local Hamiltonians. Simulations on frustrated Hamiltonians reveal notable improvements in accuracy and resource efficiency, highlighting the potential of our approach for practical applications in near-term quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Excited-State Calculations for Molecules Based on Contextual Subspace Method and Symmetry Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing methods for excited-state calculations remain underexplored in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, despite their critical role in photochemistry and material science. Herein, we propose a resource-efficient framework that integrates the contextual subspace (CS) method with the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to enable systematic excited-state calculations for molecules while reducing qubit requirements. On the basis of the numerical results, we find that it is unproblematic to utilize this combination in calculating the excited state to reduce qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implementation of a spin-conserving hardware-efficient ansatz, namely the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ block ansatz, allows exploitation of spin symmetry within the projected subspace, thereby achieving further reductions in computational resource demands. Compared to the commonly used $R_{y}R_{z}$ ansatz, using the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ ansatz can reduce the number of optimization iterations by up to 3 times at a similar circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Comparison of encoding schemes for quantum computing of $S &gt; 1/2$ spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare four different encoding schemes for the quantum computing of spin chains with a spin quantum number $S&gt;1/2$: a compact mapping, a direct (or one-hot) mapping, a Dicke mapping, and a qudit mapping. The three different qubit encoding schemes are assessed by conducting Hamiltonian simulation for $1/2 \le S \le 5/2$ using a trapped-ion quantum computer. The qudit mapping is tested by running simulations with a simple noise model. The Dicke mapping, in which the spin states are encoded as superpositions of multi-qubit states, is found to be the most efficient because of the small number of terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. We also investigate the $S$-dependence of the time step length $\Delta\tau$ in the Suzuki-Trotter approximation and find that, in order to obtain the same accuracy for all $S$, $\Delta\tau$ should be inversely proportional to $S$.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free measurement of wavefunction collapse with interferometers in quantum superpositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach for measuring wavefunction collapse is proposed which, unlike interferometric measurements, is not affected by decoherence. A mirror of a Michelson interferometer is transferred into a quantum superposition, where the decay of the mirror superposition is measured by the fact that it affects the probability of detecting photons in the interferometer. The experiment can be realised with currently available technology for photon generation and detection and is suitable for testing collapse models, which is shown by calculating the expected outcomes for the gravity-based models of Di\'osi and Penrose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore integrable Landau-Zener-type Hamiltonians through the framework of Lie algebraic structures. By reformulating the classic two-level Landau-Zener model as a Lax equation, we show that higher-spin generalizations lead to exactly solvable scattering matrices, which can be computed efficiently for any higher-spin representation. We further extend this approach to generalized bow-tie Landau-Zener Hamiltonians, employing non-Abelian gauge fields that satisfy a zero-curvature condition to derive their scattering matrices algebraically. This method enables the systematic construction of new exactly solvable multi-level models; as a result, we present previously unknown six-dimensional and eight-dimensional Landau-Zener models.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of squeezed states via enhanced bosonic encoding in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully digital approach for simulating single-mode squeezed states on a superconducting quantum processor using an enhanced bosonic encoding strategy. By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r&gt;1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum AIXI: Universal Intelligence via Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical analogues of AIXI. To address this question, we extend the framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally affects QAIXI models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of giant atoms goes beyond the local interaction paradigm in the conventional quantum optics, and predicts novel phenomena, such as oscillating bound states in the continuum (BICs) and decoherence-free interaction (DFI) that do not exist in small atoms, for some particular parameter settings of coupling positions and strengths. However, in the realistic experiments to implement giant-atom systems, there is always some level of disorder both in coupling positions and strengths. In this work, we investigate the effects of disorder on the phenomena related to giant atoms. We find that the giant-atom related phenomena are robust to both disorders of coupling positions and strengths in the Markovian regime, but more sensitive to the disorder of coupling positions in the non-Markovian regime. Our work shows that, to observe the non-Markovian phenomenon such as (oscillating) BICs in giant-atom systems, more precision is needed to control the disorder of coupling positions than that of the coupling strengths in the experiments.</description>

Abstract: We show how the fundamental entropic inequality proved recently in [arXiv:2408.15306] can be applied to obtain a useful relation for the Holevo quantity of discrete and continuous ensembles of quantum states.
  This relation gives a tight upper bound on the Holevo quantity of a given ensemble $\mu$ expressed in terms of the Holevo quantities of two auxiliary ensembles $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$ produced by $\mu$. Among others, this implies quite accurate upper bounds on the Holevo quantity of a discrete ensemble of quantum states expressed via the probabilities and the metric characteristics of an ensemble.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops and analyses a novel quantum combinatorial game: quantum checkers (codenamed Cheqqers). The concepts of superposition, entanglement, measurements and interference from quantum mechanics are integrated into the game of checkers by adding new types of legal moves. The addition of these new rules is done gradually by introducing several levels of `quantumness'. Quantum checkers provides a framework for interpolating between a known and solved classical game and a more complex quantum game, and serves as 1) a benchmark for AI players learning to play quantum games and 2) an interesting game for human players that allows them to build intuition for quantum phenomena. We provide the initial analysis on the complexity of this game using random agents and a Monte Carlo tree search agent.</description>

Abstract: Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) wave packets, known for their vortex structure and nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), are of great interest in various scientific fields. Here we study the nonrelativistic dynamics of a spatially-localized electron LG wave packet interacting with an inhomogeneous external electric field that violates the axial symmetry of the initial wave function. We focus on the analysis of the electron density and demonstrate how it is affected by the external field. Within the first order of perturbation theory, we calculate the electron wave function and reveal that the electric field may significantly alter the wave packet's structure and distort its qualitative form. We demonstrate that due to the interaction with the external field, the degenerate zeros of the initial wave function located on the $z$ axis split into multiple nondegenerate nodes in the transverse plane representing separate single-charge vortices. This mechanism resembles the analogous effects known in topological optics. These findings provide new insights into controlling and manipulating twisted matter beams and into their possible instabilities.</description>

      <title>Majorana Signatures in the Tripartite Uncertainty Relations with Quantum Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantumness imposes a fundamental limit on measurement accuracy. The paradigmatic cases are Heisenberg's uncertainty relation in the original formulation, Robertson's formulation, and improved uncertainty relations. However, the more universal measures are given in terms of quantum entropies. Uncertainties of measurements done on one quantum system correlated with another quantum system constitute a more intriguing question. Quantum correlations can influence the lower bound of uncertainties, and the reason for this is the quantum memory. In this article, we study uncertainties of measurements performed on one quantum dot correlated with the second one through the superconductor, hosting the Majorana boundary modes. We prove that the Majorana quasiparticles allow the uncertainties to reach the minimal possible lower bound. By rigorous theoretical considerations, we obtain the result of experimental relevance expressed in terms of only two parameters: the overlap between Majorana modes and their coupling strength with the quantum dots. We show that the overlap between Majorana modes reduces quantum uncertainties, which is a general result of fundamental importance. We also propose the protocol to measure spins in both quantum dots, consecutively, and demonstrate that the result of the second measurement would depend on the presence of Majorana quasiparticles. This could serve as an indirect tool for their empirical observation, which is of importance for the ongoing discussions concerning unambiguous detection of the Majorana quasiparticles in nanoscopic hybrid structures.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on Quantum Fisher Information in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted considerable interest over the last few decades due to their unique spectral and dynamical properties not encountered in Hermitian counterparts. An intensely debated question is whether non-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are operated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current analysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for Hermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved. Here, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI) defined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This covariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a consistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the covariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of corresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual to each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two. Importantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the covariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in pseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.</description>

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>

Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>

      <title>QuXAI: Explainers for Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Models</title>

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>
