      <title>Micromorphic FE$^2$ Simulation of Plastic Deformations of Foam Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing and predicting the effective mechanical properties of highly porous cellular media still represents a significant challenge for the research community, due to their complex structural interdependencies and known size effects. Micromorphic theories are often applied in this context to model the inelastic deformation behavior of foam-like structures, in particular to incorporate such size effect into the investigation of structure-property correlations. This raises the problems of formulating appropriate constitutive relations for the numerous non-classical stress measures and determining the corresponding material parameters, which are usually difficult to assess experimentally. The present contribution therefore alternatively employs a concurrent micromorphic multi-scale approach within the Direct FE$^2$ framework to simulate the complex irreversible behavior of foam-like porous solids. The predictions of Cosserat (micropolar) and a fully-micromorphic theory are compared with conventional FE$^2$ results and direct numerical simulations (DNS) for complex loading scenarios with elastic, elastic-plastic, and creep deformations.</description>

      <title>Flow of Electrically Charged Fluids Through Elastic Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flow of an electrically charged fluid through an elastic and porous medium. A three continuum model consisting of an elastic solid, a viscous fluid, and a mobile charge continuum is used. The relevant laws of physics are applied systematically to the constituents or the combined continuum, leading to their continuity equations for conservation of mass or charge, linear and angular momentum equations as well as constitutive relations. The analysis assumes quasistatic electric fields and is for nonmagnetizable materials. The resulting theory is nonlinear, valid for large deformations and strong fields and can be specialized or generalized in various ways.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of sessile aqueous droplets laden with surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With most of the focus to date having been on the coalescence of freely suspended droplets, much less is known about the coalescence of sessile droplets, especially in the case of droplets laden with surfactant. Here, we employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate this phenomenon on substrates with different wettability. In particular, we unravel the mass transport mechanism of surfactant during coalescence, thus explaining the key mechanisms present in the process. Close similarities are found between the coalescence of sessile droplets with equilibrium contact angles above 90{\deg} and that of freely suspended droplets, being practically the same when the contact angle of the sessile droplets is above 140{\deg}. Here, the initial contact point is an area that creates an initial contact film of surfactant that proceeds to break into engulfed aggregates. A major change in the physics appears below the 90{\deg} contact angle, when the initial contact point becomes small and line-like, strongly affecting many aspects of the process and allowing water to take part in the coalescence from the beginning. We find growth exponents consistent with a 2/3 power law on strongly wettable substrates but no evidence of linear growth. Overall bridge growth speed increases with wettability for all surfactant concentrations, but the speeding up effect becomes weaker as surfactant concentration grows, along with a general slowdown of the coalescence compared to pure water. Concurrently, the duration of the initial thermally limited regime increases strongly by almost an order of magnitude for strongly wettable substrates.</description>

      <title>Interaction between U-shaped amyloid beta fibril and semiconducting silicon nitride monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by some recent works showing the ability of semiconducting monolayers to disintegrate the structures of biological fibrils, we have applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in both classical and quantum regimes to investigate whether semiconducting Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has the same ability on interaction with U-shaped amyloid beta (A$\beta$) fibril. A number of conventional MD indicators have then been calculated including root mean square deviation, gyration radius, per-residue root mean square fluctuation, number of hydrogen bonds, solvent-accessible surface area, and secondary structure of the fibril as functions of time. Results showed that the monolayer is capable of affecting fibril's conformation. We also found that disintegration begins from the last chain (chain E) due to the rather strong interaction between the monolayer and the fibril residues numbered from 17 to 28 on the very chain, also engaging the next chain (chain D) as the time goes by. The $\beta$-sheet-rich content of chain E accordingly turns into other secondary-structure types including "turn", "coil", and "isolated bridge", decreasing the $\beta$-sheet content of the entire fibril as well. Results support the view that Si$_3$N$_4$ monolayer has a potential for destabilizing the structure of U-shaped amyloid beta fibrils.</description>

      <title>The role of fluid friction in streamer formation and biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacillus subtilis biofilms were grown in laminar channel flow at wall shear stress spanning one order of magnitude ($\tau_w = 0.068$ Pa to $\tau_w = 0.67$ Pa). We monitor, non-invasively, the evolution of the three-dimensional distribution of biofilm over seven days using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The obtained biofilms consist of many microcolonies where the characteristic colony has a base structure in the form of a leaning pillar and a streamer in the form of a thin filament that originates near the tip of the pillar. While the shape, size and distribution of these microcolonies depend on the imposed shear stress, the same structural features appear consistently for all shear stress values. The formation of streamers seems to occur after the development of a base structure, suggesting that the latter induces a curved secondary flow that triggers the formation of the streamers. Moreover, we observe that the biofilm volume grows approximately linearly over seven days for all the shear stress values, with a growth rate that is inversely proportional to the wall shear stress. We develop a simple model of friction-limited growth, which agrees with the experimental observations. The model provides physical insight into growth mechanisms and can be used to develop accurate continuum models of bacterial biofilm growth.</description>

      <title>A bi-directional low-Reynolds-number swimmer with passive elastic arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that it is possible to design simple artificial swimmers at low Reynoldsnumber that possess only one degree of freedom and, nevertheless, can overcome Purcell's celebratedscallop theorem. One of the few examples is given by Montino and DeSimone, Eur. Phys. J. E, vol.38, 2015, who consider the three-sphere Swimmer of Najafi and Golestanian, replacing one active armwith a passive elastic spring. We further generalize this idea by increasing the number of springs andshow that it is possible to invert the swimming direction using the frequency of the single actuatedarm.</description>

      <title>Measuring Colloidomer Hydrodynamics with Holographic Video Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-line holographic video microscopy records a wealth of information about the microscopic structure and dynamics of colloidal materials. Powerful analytical techniques are available to retrieve that information when the colloidal particles are well-separated. Large assemblies of close-packed particles create holograms that are substantially more challenging to interpret. We demonstrate that Rayleigh-Sommerfeld back-propagation is useful for analyzing holograms of colloidomer chains, close-packed linear assemblies of micrometer-scale emulsion droplets. Colloidomers are fully flexible chains and undergo three-dimensional configurational changes under the combined influence of random thermal forces and hydrodynamic forces. We demonstrate the ability of holographic reconstruction to track these changes as colloidomers sediment through water in a horizontal slit pore. Comparing holographically measured configurational trajectories with predictions of hydrodynamic models both validates the analytical technique for this valuable class of self-organizing materials and also provides insights into the influence of geometric confinement on colloidomer hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Field Model of Cells on a Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase field models have emerged as an important computational tool for understanding biological tissue while resolving single-cell properties. While they have successfully reproduced many experimentally observed behaviors of living tissue, the theoretical underpinnings have not been fully explored. We show that a two-dimensional version of the model, which is commonly employed to study tissue monolayers, can be derived from a three-dimensional version in the presence of a substrate. We also show how viscous forces, which arise from friction between different cells, can be included in the model. Finally, we numerically simulate a tissue monolayer, and find that intercellular friction tends to solidify the tissue.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of inflating balloons and interacting hysterons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many materials exhibit a complex, hysteretic response to external driving, there has been a surge of interest in how the complex dynamics of internal materials states can be understood and designed to process and store information. We consider a system of connected rubber balloons that can be described by a Preisach model of non-interacting hysterons under pressure control, but for which the hysterons become coupled under volume control. We study this system by exploring the possible transition graphs, as well as by introducing a configuration space approach which tracks the volumes of each balloon. Changes in the transition graphs turn out to be related to changes in the topology of the configuration space of the balloons, providing a particularly geometric view of how transition graphs can be designed, as well as additional information on the existence of hidden metastable states. This class of systems is more general than just balloons.</description>

      <title>Irreversible dynamics of a continuum driven by active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuational behavior of overdamped elastic filaments (e.g., strings or rods) driven by active matter which induces irreversibility. The statistics of discrete normal modes are translated into the continuum of the position representation which allows discernment of the spatial structure of dissipation and fluctuational work done by the active forces. The mapping of force statistics onto filament statistics leads to a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation which predicts the components of the stochastic area tensor and its spatial proxy, the irreversibility field. We illustrate the general theory with explicit results for a tensioned string between two fixed endpoints. Plots of the stochastic area tensor components in the discrete plane of mode pairs reveal how the active forces induce spatial correlations of displacement along the filament. The irreversibility field provides additional quantitative insight into the relative spatial distributions of fluctuational work and dissipative response.</description>

      <title>A simple and accurate method to determine fluid-crystal phase boundaries from direct coexistence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One method for computationally determining phase boundaries is to explicitly simulate a direct coexistence between the two phases of interest. Although this approach works very well for fluid-fluid coexistences, it is often considered to be less useful for fluid-crystal transitions, as additional care must be taken to prevent the simulation boundaries from imposing unwanted strains on the crystal phase. Here, we present a simple adaptation to the direct coexistence method that nonetheless allows us to obtain highly accurate predictions of fluid-crystal coexistence conditions. We test our approach on hard spheres, the screened Coulomb potential, and a 2D patchy-particle model. In all cases, we find excellent agreement between the direct coexistence approach and (much more cumbersome) free-energy calculation methods. Moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to resolve the (tiny) free-energy difference between the face-centered cubic and hexagonally close-packed crystal of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit. The simplicity of this method also ensures that it can be trivially implemented in essentially any simulation method or package. Hence, this approach provides an excellent alternative to free-energy based methods for the precise determination of phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Liquid Crossover in Water Model: Local Structure vs. Kinetics of Hydrogen Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In equilibrium and supercooled liquids, polymorphism is manifested by thermodynamic regions defined in the phase diagram, which are predominantly of different short- and medium-range order (local structure). It is found that on the phase diagram of the water model, the thermodynamic region corresponding to the equilibrium liquid phase is divided by a line of the smooth liquid-liquid crossover. In the case of the water model, this crossover is revealed by various local order parameters and corresponds to pressures of the order of $3\,150 \pm 350$ atm at ambient temperature. In the vicinity of the crossover, the dynamics of water molecules change significantly, which is reflected, in particular, in the fact that the self-diffusion coefficient reaches its maximum values. In addition, changes in the structure also manifest themselves in changes in the kinetics of hydrogen bonding, which is captured by values of such the quantities as the average lifetime of hydrogen bonding, the average lifetimes of different local coordination numbers, and the frequencies of changes in different local coordination numbers. An interpretation of the hydrogen bond kinetics in terms of the free energy landscape concept in the space of possible coordination numbers is proposed.</description>

      <title>Splay-bend elastic inequalities shape tactoids, toroids, umbilics, and conic section walls in paraelectric, twist-bend, and ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic constants of splay K_11, twist K_22, and bend K_33 of nematic liquid crystals are often assumed to be equal to each other in order to simplify the theoretical description of complex director fields. Here we present examples of how the disparity of K_11 and K_33 produces effects that cannot be described in a one-constant approximation. In a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal, nematic droplets coexisting with the isotropic phase change their shape from a simply-connected tactoid to a topologically distinct toroid as a result of temperature or concentration variation. The transformation is caused by the increase of the splay-to-bend ratio K_11/K_33. A phase transition from a conventional nematic to a twist-bend nematic implies that the ratio K_11/K_33 changes from very large to very small. As a result, the defects caused by an externally applied electric field change the deformation mode of optic axis from bend to splay. In the paraelectric-ferroelectric nematic transition, one finds an inverse situation: K_11/K_33 changes from small to large, which shapes the domain walls in the spontaneous electric polarization field as conic sections. The polarization field tends to be solenoidal, or divergence-free, a behavior complementary to irrotational curl-free director textures of a smectic A.</description>

      <title>Tangential diffusion and motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth is a known driver of cellular dynamics in a range of dense aggregates from bacterial colonies to developing tissues to tumors. Hence, universal physical principles underlying these dynamics are of great interdisciplinary interest. Here, we study the emergent dynamics arising from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing three-dimensional spheroids. Our results show that, without cell motility, deterministic motion caused by overall volume expansion dominates the dynamics of individual cells in the radial direction, while growth and division lead to cellular-scale diffusive motion in the tangential direction, whose magnitude is largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, we show that cell lineages are subject to confinement in their local environment, quenching weak cell motility. At higher motility, we find a transient regime of tangential superdiffusivity, which is accompanied by global mixing of cells. A quantitative analysis reveals a diverging mixing time scale at the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The observations may serve as a baseline for the identification of phenomena caused by additional biological mechanisms in experiments on tissue spheroids, which have become a popular model system in biophysics and other fields. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrophoresis is the motion of particles relative to a surrounding fluid driven by a uniform electric field. In conventional electrophoresis, the electrophoretic velocity grows linearly with the applied field. Nonlinear effects with a quadratic speed vs field dependence are gaining research interest since an alternating current field could drive them. Here we report on the giant nonlinearity of electrophoresis in a nematic liquid crystal in which the speed grows with the fourth and sixth powers of the electric field. The mechanism is attributed to the shear thinning of the nematic environment induced by the moving colloid. The observed giant nonlinear effect dramatically enhances the efficiency of electrophoretic transport.</description>

      <title>Reduced model and nonlinear analysis of localized instabilities of residually stressed cylinders under axial stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a dimensional reduction to obtain a one-dimensional model to analyze localized necking or bulging in a residually stressed circular cylindrical solid. The nonlinear theory of elasticity is first specialized to obtain the equations governing the homogeneous deformation. Then, to analyze the non-homogeneous part, we include higher order correction terms of the axisymmetric displacement components leading to a three- dimensional form of the total potential energy functional. Details of the reduction to the one-dimensional form are given. We focus on a residually stressed Gent material and use numerical methods to solve the governing equations. Two loading conditions are considered. In the first, the residual stress is maintained constant, while the axial stretch is used as the loading parameter. In the second, we keep the pre-stretch constant and monotonically increase the residual stress until bifurcation occurs. We specify initial conditions, find the critical values for localized bifurcation and compute the change in radius during localized necking or bulging growth. Finally, we optimize material properties and use the one-dimensional model to simulate necking or bulging until the Maxwell values of stretch are reached.</description>

      <title>Flipping Out: Role of Arginine in Hydrophobic Polymer Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arginine has been a mainstay in biological formulation development for decades. To date, the way arginine modulates protein stability has been widely studied and debated. Here, we employed a hydrophobic polymer to decouple hydrophobic effects from other interactions relevant to protein folding. While existing hypotheses for the effects of arginine can generally be categorized as either direct or indirect, our results indicate that direct and indirect mechanisms of arginine co-exist and oppose each other. At low concentrations, arginine was observed to stabilize hydrophobic polymer collapse via a sidechain-dominated direct mechanism, while at high concentrations, arginine stabilized polymer collapse via a backbone-dominated indirect mechanism. These findings highlight the modular nature of the widely used additive arginine, with relevance in the design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Cloaking Transition of Droplets on Lubricated Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium properties and the wetting behavior of a simple liquid on a polymer brush, with and without presence of lubricant by multibody Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations. The lubricant is modelled as a polymeric liquid consisting of short chains that are chemically identical to the brush polymers. We investigate the behavior of the brush in terms of the grafting density and the amount of lubricant present. Regarding the wetting behavior, we study a sessile droplet on top of the brush. The droplet consists of non-bonded particles that form a dense phase. Our model and choice of parameters result in the formation of a wetting ridge and in the cloaking of the droplet by the lubricant, i.e. the lubricant chains creep up onto the droplet and eventually cover its surface completely. Cloaking is a phenomenon that is observed experimentally and is of integral importance to the dynamics of sliding droplets. We quantify the cloaking in terms of its thickness, which increases with the amount of lubricant present. The analysis reveals a well-defined transition point where the cloaking sets in. We propose a thermodynamic theory to explain this behavior. In addition we investigate the dependence of the contact angles on the size of the droplet and the possible effect of line tension. We quantify the variation of the contact angle with the curvature of the contact line on a lubricant free brush and find a negative value for the line tension. Finally we investigate the effect of cloaking/lubrication on the contact angles and the wetting ridge. We find that lubrication and cloaking reduce the contact angles by a couple of degrees. The effect on the wetting ridge is a reduction in the extension of the brush chains near the three phase contact line, an effect that was also observed in experiments of droplets on crosslinked gels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Recovering the activity parameters of an active fluid confined in a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of an active fluid, for example, a bacterial bath or a collection of microtubules and molecular motors, can be accessed through the dynamics of passive particle probes. Here, in the perspective of analyzing experimental situations of confinement in droplets, we consider the kinematics of a negatively buoyant probe particle in an active fluid, both confined within a spherical domain. The active bath generates a fluctuating flow that pushes the particle with a velocity that is modeled as a colored stochastic noise, characterized by two parameters, the intensity and memory time of the active flow. When the particle departs a little from the bottom of the spherical domain, the configuration is well approximated by a particle in a two-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to the colored noise, in which case an analytical solution exists, which is the base for quantitative analysis. We numerically simulate the dynamics of the particle and use the planar, two-dimensional mean square displacement to recover the activity parameters of the bath. This approach yields satisfactory results as long as the particle remains relatively confined, that is, as long as the intensity of the colored noise remains low.</description>

      <title>Cytoplasmic Viscosity is a Potential Biomarker for Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular microrheology has shown that cancer cells with high metastatic potential are softer compared to non-tumorigenic normal cells. These findings rely on measuring the apparent Young modulus of whole cells using primarily atomic force microscopy. This study aims to explore whether alternative mechanical parameters have discriminating features with regard to metastatic potential. Magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS) is employed in the examination of mammary epithelial cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, representing low and high meta-static potential, alongside normal-like MCF-10A cells. MRS utilizes active micron-sized magnetic wires in a rotating magnetic field to measure the viscosity and elastic modulus of the cy-toplasm. All three cell lines display viscoelastic behavior, with cytoplasmic viscosities ranging from 10-70 Pa s and elastic moduli from 30-80 Pa. It is found that the tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells are softer than the MCF-10A cells, with a twofold decrease in elastic modulus. To differentiate cells with low and high malignancy however, viscosity emerges as the more discriminating parameter, as MCF-7 exhibits a 5 times higher viscosity as compared to MDA-MB-231. These findings highlight the sensitivity of cytoplasmic viscosity to metastatic potential, suggesting its potential utility as a mechanical marker for malignant cancer cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a detailed experimental analysis using high-speed imagery to explore the impact dynamics of water droplets on liquid-infused surfaces (LIS). The LIS surfaces were created from textured substrates with varied post-spacings and were functionalized using octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS). Two types of liquid-infused surfaces were investigated: those coated with silicone oil (van der Waals) and those coated with Hexadecane (non-van der Waals). Droplet impacts were systematically investigated on these surfaces across a broad range of Weber numbers. Additionally, we assessed the stability of the LIS surface by calculating cloaking and spreading coefficients. The experimental outcomes revealed distinct droplet dynamics, including spreading, rebound, and unique phenomena related to oil interaction with surface textures. This study provides insights into the intricate dynamics of droplet interactions with LIS, offering valuable contributions to understanding surface-wetting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Replica Field Theory for a Generalized Franz--Parisi Potential of Inhomogeneous Glassy Systems: New Closure and the Associated Self-Consistent Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On approaching the dynamical transition temperature, supercooled liquids show heterogeneity over space and time. Static replica theory investigates the dynamical crossover in terms of the free energy landscape (FEL). Two kinds of static approaches have provided a self-consistent equation for determining this crossover, similar to the mode coupling theory for glassy dynamics. One uses the Morita-Hiroike formalism of the liquid state theory, whereas the other relies on the density functional theory (DFT). Each of the two approaches has advantages in terms of perturbative field theory. Here, we develop a replica field theory that has the benefits from both formulations. We introduce the generalized Franz-Parisi potential to formulate a correlation functional. Considering fluctuations around an inhomogeneous density determined by the Ramakrishnan--Yussouf DFT, we find a new closure as the stability condition of the correlation functional. The closure leads to the self-consistent equation involving the triplet direct correlation function. The present field theory further helps us study the FEL beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many bacteria share the fascinating ability to sense Earth's magnetic field -- a process known as magnetotaxis. These bacteria synthesize magnetic nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, within their own cell body and arrange them to form a linear magnetic chain. The chain, which behaves like a compass needle, aligns the microorganisms with the geomagnetic field. Here, we measure the magnetic hysteresis of an individual bacterium of the species Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense via ultrasensitive torque magnetometry. These measurements, in combination with transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, reveal the magnetic configurations of the magnetosomes, their progression as a function of applied field, as well as the total remanent magnetic moment and effective magnetic anisotropy of a chain within a single bacterium. Knowledge of magnetic properties is crucial both for understanding the mechanisms behind magnetotaxis and for the design of systems exploiting magnetotactic bacteria in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Electrolubrication in flowing liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the ``electrolubrication'' occurring in liquid mixtures confined between two charged surfaces. For a mixture of two liquids, the effective viscosity decreases markedly in the presence of a field. The origin of this reduction is field-induced phase separation, leading to the formation of two low-viscosity lubrication layers at the surfaces. These layers facilitate larger strain at a given stress. The effect is strong if the viscosities of the two liquids are sufficiently different, the volume fraction of the less viscous liquid is small, the gap between the surfaces is small, and the applied potential is large. The phase separation relies on the existence of dissociated ions in the solution. The effective viscosity is reduced by a factor $\alpha$; its maximum value is the ratio between the viscosities of the two liquids. In most liquids, $\alpha \sim1 $ -- $10$, and in mixtures of water and glycerol $\alpha \sim 80$ -- $100$ under relatively small potentials.</description>

      <title>Electrolubrication in liquid mixtures between two parallel plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe theoretically ``electrolubrication'' in liquid mixtures, the phenomenon where an electric field applied transverse to the confining surfaces leads to concentration gradients that alter the flow profile significantly. When the more polar liquid is the less viscous one, the stress in the liquid falls on two electric-field-induced thin lubrication layers. The thickness of the lubrication layer depends on the Debye length and the mixture correlation length. For the simple case of two parallel and infinite plates, we calculate explicitly the liquid velocity profile and integrated flux. The maximum liquid velocity and flux can be increased by a factor $\alpha$, of order $10$--$100$ or even more. For a binary mixture of water and a cosolvent, with viscosities $\eta_w$ and $\eta_{\rm cs}$, respectively, $\alpha$ increases monotonically with inter-plate potential $V$ and average ion content, and is large if the ratio $\eta_{\rm cs}/\eta_w$ is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bridging transitions between a pair of non-planar surfaces. We show that the transition can be described using a generalized Kelvin equation by mapping the system to a slit of finite length. The proposed equation is applied to analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the growth of the bridging film, which occurs when the confining walls are gradually flattened. This phenomenon is characterized by a power-law divergence with geometry-dependent critical exponents that we determine for a wide class of walls' geometries. In particular, for a linear-wedge model, a covariance law revealing a relation between a geometric and Young's contact angle is presented. These predictions are shown to be fully in line with the numerical results obtained from a microscopic (classical) density functional theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a prototypical mode of single-cell migration, retrograde cytoskeletal flow is mechanically coupled to the environment, propels the cell, and is sustained by an anterograde cytosolic flow of disassembled cytoskeletal components. Supracellular collectives also develop fountain-flows to migrate, but the opposing cellular streams interact with the environment producing conflicting forces. To understand the biophysical constraints of fountain-flow supracellular migration, we develop an active gel model of a cell cluster driven by a polarized peripheral contractile cable. While the model develops fountain-flows and directed migration, efficiency and cluster velocity are extremely small compared to observations. We find that patterned friction or cluster-polarized single-cell directed migration, both suggested by contact inhibition of locomotion, rescue robust and efficient supracellular migration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we transformed a set of 1,000 scientific papers in the area of biological materials into detailed ontological knowledge graphs, revealing their inherently scale-free nature. Using graph traversal path detection between dissimilar concepts based on combinatorial ranking of node similarity and betweenness centrality, we reveal deep insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, and propose never-before-seen material designs and their behaviors. One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. The algorithm further created an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite that incorporates joint synthesis of graph sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's Composition VII painting, where the resulting composite reflects a balance of chaos and order, with features like adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across physical, biological, and artistic spheres, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence and material flux that resonates with postmodern philosophy, and positions these interconnections within a heterarchical framework. Our findings reveal the dynamic, context-dependent interplay of entities beyond traditional hierarchical paradigms, emphasizing the significant role of individual components and their fluctuative relationships within the system. Our predictions achieve a far higher degree of novelty, technical detail and explorative capacity than conventional generative AI methods. The approach establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections that facilitate discovery.</description>

      <title>Strain stiffening universality in composite hydrogels and soft tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft biological tissues exhibit a remarkable resilience to large mechanical loads, a property which is associated with the strain stiffening capability of the biopolymer networks that structurally support the tissues. Yet, recent studies have shown that composite systems such as tissues and blood clots exhibit mechanical properties that contradict those of the polymer matrix - demonstrating stiffening in compression, but softening in shear and tension. The microscopic basis of this apparent paradox remains poorly understood. We show that composite hydrogels and tissues do indeed exhibit non-linear elastic stiffening in shear - which is governed by the stretching of the polymer chains in the matrix - and that it is driven by the same mechanism that drives compression stiffening. However, we show that the non-linear elastic stiffening in composite hydrogels and tissues is masked by mechanical dissipation arising from filler-polymer interactions known as the Mullins effect, and we introduce a method to characterize the non-linear elasticity of the composites in isolation from this overall strain softening response through large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments. We present a comprehensive characterization of the non-linear elastic strain stiffening of composite hydrogels and soft tissues, and show that the strain stiffening in shear and compression are both governed by universal strain amplification factors that depend on essential properties of the composite system, such as the filler concentration and the filler-polymer interaction strength. These results elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the non-linear mechanics of tissues, which provides design principles for engineering tissue-mimetic soft materials, and have broad implications for cell-matrix mechanotransduction in living tissues under strain.</description>

Abstract: While bacterial swarms can exhibit active turbulence in vacant spaces, they naturally inhabit crowded environments. We numerically show that driving disorderly active fluids through porous media enhances Darcy's law. While purely active flows average to zero flux, hybrid active/driven flows display greater drift than pure-driven fluids. This enhancement is non-monotonic with activity, leading to an optimal activity to maximize flow rate. We incorporate the active contribution into an active Darcy's law, which may serve to help understand anomalous transport of swarming in porous media.</description>

      <title>Virial Equation of State for a Granular System</title>

Abstract: The equation of state for an ideal gas is simple, which is $P=nk_{\rm B}T$. In the case of imperfect gases where mutual interactions among the constituents are important, pressure $P$ can be expressed as the series expansion of density $n$ with appropriate coefficients, known as virial coefficients $B_m$. In this paper, we have obtained the first four virial coefficients for a model interaction potential $\Phi(r)$ using multidimensional Monte-Carlo integration and importance sampling methods. Next, we perform molecular dynamics simulations with the same $\Phi(r)$ for a many-particle system to obtain $P$ as a function of $T$ and $n$. We compare our numerical data with the virial equation of state.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Repulsion Between Chromosomes in Mammalian Oocyte Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To prepare gametes with the appropriate number of chromosomes, mammalian oocytes undergo two sequential cell divisions. During each division, a large, long-lived, microtubule-based organelle called the meiotic spindle assembles around condensed chromosomes. Although meiotic spindles have been intensively studied for several decades, as force-generating mechanical objects, they remain very poorly understood. In materials physics, coarse-grained theories have been essential in understanding the large-scale behavior of systems composed of many interacting particles. It is unclear, however, if this approach can succeed in capturing the properties of active, biochemically complex, living materials like the spindle. Here, we show that a class of models based on nematic liquid crystal theory can describe important aspects of the organelle-scale structure and dynamics of spindles in living mouse oocytes. Using our models to interpret quantitative polarization microscopy data, we measure for the first time material properties relating to stress propagation in living oocytes, including the nematic diffusivities corresponding to splay and bend deformations. Unlike the reconstituted amphibian spindles that were previously studied in vitro, nematic elastic stress is exponentially screened in the microtubule network of living mammalian oocytes, with a screening length of order one micron. This observation can be explained by the relatively high volume fraction of embedded chromosomes in mammalian meiotic spindles, which cause long voids in the microtubule network and so disrupt orientational stress propagation.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts of freely relaxing systems using equilibrium physical observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems, when initially placed far from equilibrium, exhibit surprising behavior in their attempt to equilibrate. Striking examples are the Mpemba effect and the cooling-heating asymmetry. These anomalous behaviors can be exploited to shorten the time needed to cool down (or heat up) a system. Though, a strategy to design these effects in mesoscopic systems is missing. We bring forward a description that allows us to formulate such strategies, and, along the way, makes natural these paradoxical behaviors. In particular, we study the evolution of macroscopic physical observables of systems freely relaxing under the influence of one or two instantaneous thermal quenches. The two crucial ingredients in our approach are timescale separation and a nonmonotonic temperature evolution of an important state function. We argue that both are generic features near a first-order transition. Our theory is exemplified with the one-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field using analytic results and numerical experiments.</description>
