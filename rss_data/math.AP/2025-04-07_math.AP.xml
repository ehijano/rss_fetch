      <title>Mixing Estimates for Passive Scalar Transport by $BV$ Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative mixing estimate for the Cauchy problem for transport along divergence-free vector fields with bounded variation. By developing a framework that quantifies Ambrosio's regularisation scheme, we derive the first explicit bounds on the mixing rate for general $BV$ vector fields. Our analysis reveals that tetration (repeated exponentiation) emerges in the mixing rate from the local nature of Ambrosio's regularisation.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-estimates for the wave equation with critical magnetic potential on conical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of conical singular spaces $\Sigma=(0,\infty)_r\times Y$ equipped with the metric $g=\mathrm{d}r^2+r^2h$, where the cross section $Y$ is a compact $(n-1)$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold $(Y,h)$ without boundary. In this context, we aim to show that the sine wave propagator $\sin\left(t\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}}\right)/\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}}$ is bounded in $L^{p}(\Sigma)$, where $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{A}}$ is a magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a scaling-critical magnetic potential on metric cone $\Sigma$. Our main result is the generalization of the result in \cite{L}. The novel ingredient is the construction of Hadamard parametrix for $\cos\left(t\sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\bf A}}\right)$ on $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimal Transport with Optimal Preferential Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic optimal transport type problem on a domain that consists of two parts: a compact set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ (bulk) and a non-intersecting and sufficiently regular curve $\Gamma \subset \Omega$. On each of them, a Benamou-Brenier type dynamic optimal transport problem is considered, yet with an additional mechanism that allows the exchange (at a cost) of mass between bulk and curve. In the respective actions, we also allow for non-linear mobilities. We first ensure the existence of minimizers by relying on the direct method of calculus of variations and we study the asymptotic properties of the minimizers under changes in the parameters regulating the dynamics in $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$.
  Then, we study the case when the curve $\Gamma$ is also allowed to change, being the main interest in this paper. To this end, the Tangent-Point energy is added to the action functional in order to preserve the regularity properties of the curve and prevent self-intersections. Also in this case, by relying on suitable compactness estimates both for the time-dependent measures and the curve $\Gamma$, the existence of optimizers is shown.
  We extend these analytical findings by numerical simulations based on a primal-dual approach that illustrate the behaviour of geodesics, for fixed and varying curves.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for discrete bi-Schr\"{o}dinger operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the discrete Laplace operator $\Delta$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies the following sharp time decay estimate: $$\left\|e^{it\Delta}\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0,$$ which is slower than the usual $|t|^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay in the continuous case on $\mathbb{R}$. However in this paper, we have showed that the discrete bi-Laplacian $\Delta^2$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ actually exhibits the same sharp decay estimate $|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ as its continuous counterpart.
  In view of these free decay estimates, this paper further investigates the discrete bi-Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $H=\Delta^2+V$ on the lattice space $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, where $V(n)$ is a real valued potential of $\mathbb{Z}$. Under suitable decay conditions on $V$ and assuming that both 0 and 16 are regular spectral points of $H$, we establish the following sharp $\ell^1-\ell^{\infty}$ dispersive estimates: $$\left\|e^{-itH}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{4}},\quad t\neq0,$$ where $P_{ac}(H)$ denotes the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H$. Additionally, the following decay estimates for beam equation are also derived: $$\|{\rm cos}(t\sqrt H)P_{ac}(H)\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}+\left\|\frac{{\rm sin}(t\sqrt H)}{t\sqrt H}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^1\rightarrow\ell^{\infty}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}},\quad t\neq0.$$</description>

      <title>A new energy method for shortening and straightening complete curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel energy method that reinterprets ``curve shortening'' as ``tangent aligning''. This conceptual shift enables the variational study of infinite-length curves evolving by the curve shortening flow, as well as higher order flows such as the elastic flow, which involves not only the curve shortening but also the curve straightening effect. For the curve shortening flow, we prove convergence to a straight line under mild assumptions on the ends of the initial curve. For the elastic flow, we establish a foundational global well-posedness theory, and investigate the precise long-time behavior of solutions. In fact, our method applies to a more general class of geometric evolution equations including the surface diffusion flow, Chen's flow, and the free elastic flow.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness results of a nonlinear stochastic diffusion-convection equation with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the uniqueness of solutions of a nonlinear, pseudomonotone, stochastic diffusion evolution problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions with reflection, where the noise term is additive and given by a stochastic It\^{o} integral with respect to a Hilbert space valued cylindrical Wiener process. In fact, since there is no It\^{o} formula available for a solution in general, a general uniqueness result seems not to be available. Nevertheless, assuming more regularity for the solutions or the reflection, we may show some comparison principles.</description>

      <title>Exponential equilibration of an electro-energy-reaction-diffusion system arising from a two-level semiconductor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically correct framework for electro-energy-reaction-diffusion systems, which feature a monotone entropy functional while conserving the total charge and the total energy. For these systems, we construct a relative entropy functional, which acts as a Lyapunov functional, and we give an explicit expression for the related entropy production functional. The main result of this note is the derivation of a so-called entropy-entropy production inequality in a special situation, namely for a specific two-level semiconductor model of Shockley-Read-Hall type. Supposing that global weak solutions exist, we are able to prove that the relative entropy decays exponentially along trajectories of the underlying system. As a consequence, these global solutions converge to the equilibrium at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of travelling waves for general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-zero condition at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works [4, 5], existence and uniqueness of travelling waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations have been shown for speeds close to the speed of sound. Furthermore, it has been proved that a chain of dark solitons of well-ordered speeds near the sound speed, taken initially apart from each other, is orbitally stable. In this article, we complete this study by proving the asymptotic stability of these travelling waves, namely that a solution initially close to a travelling wave eventually converges towards a travelling wave of close speed. This relies on the methods used by F. B\'ethuel, P. Gravejat and D. Smets in [6] and first introduced by Y. Martel and F. Merle in [22].</description>

      <title>On the existence of Nehari ground states for the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on Discrete Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study standing waves for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a discrete graph. We characterize for a self-adjoint realizations of Schr\"odinger operators conditions related with the geometry of the graph that guarantee discreteness of the spectrum and study ground states on the generalized Nehari manifold in order to prove the existence of standing wave solutions in the self-focusing and defocusing case. In this context, we show properties of the solutions, such as integrability. Finally, we discuss decay properties of solutions and the bifurcation of solutions from the trivial solution.</description>

      <title>A convex integration scheme for the continuity equation past the Sobolev embedding threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a convex integration scheme for the continuity equation in the context of the Di Perna-Lions theory that allows to build incompressible vector fields in $C_{t}W^{1,p}_x$ and nonunique solutions in $C_{t} L^{q}_x$ for any $p,q$ with $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} &gt; 1 + \frac{1}{d}- \delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. This improves the previous bound, corresponding to $\delta=0$, or equivalently $q' &gt; p^*$, obtained with convex integration so far, and critical for those schemes in view of the Sobolev embedding that guarantees that solutions are distributional in the opposite range.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic relaxation of a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the solvability of a sixth-order Cahn--Hilliard equation with an inertial term, which serves as a relaxation of a higher-order variant of the classical Cahn--Hilliard equation. The equation includes a source term that disrupts the conservation of the mean value of the order parameter. The incorporation of additional spatial derivatives allows the model to account for curvature effects, leading to a more precise representation of isothermal phase separation dynamics. We establish the existence of a weak solution for the associated initial and boundary value problem under the assumption that the double-well-type nonlinearity is globally defined. Additionally, we derive uniform stability estimates, which enable us to demonstrate that any family of solutions satisfying these estimates converges in a suitable topology to the unique solution of the limiting problem as the relaxation parameter approaches zero. Furthermore, we provide an error estimate for specific norms of the difference between solutions in terms of the relaxation parameter.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every $\mathcal{C}^1(\bar\omega)$-regular subsolution of the Monge-Amp\`ere system posed on a $2$-dimensional domain $\omega$ and with target codimension $2$, can be uniformly approximated by its exact solutions with regularity $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}(\bar\omega)$ for any $\alpha&lt;1$. This result asserts flexibility of Poznyak's theorem for isometric immersions of $2$d Riemannian manifolds into $\mathbb{R}^4$, in the parallel setting of the Monge-Amp\`ere system.</description>

      <title>On the parabolic $\Phi_3^4$ model for the harmonic oscillator: diagrams and local existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the local wellposedness of the (renormalized) parabolic $\Phi^4_3$ model associated with the harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is, the equation formally written as \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t X + HX= -X^3+\infty\cdot X + \xi, \quad t&gt;0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^3, \end{equation*} where $H:=-\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3} +|x|^2$ and $\xi$ denotes a space-time white noise. This model is closely related to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which is used in the description of Bose-Einstein condensation.
  Our overall formulation of the problem, based on the so-called paracontrolled calculus, follows the strategy outlined by Mourrat and Weber for the $\Phi^4_3$ model on the three-dimensional torus. Significant effort is then required to adapt, within the framework imposed by the harmonic oscillator, the key tools that contribute to the success of this method-particularly the construction of stochastic diagrams at the core of the dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and compute solutions of a many-body model of the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. We model mechanical relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. Minimizers of the resulting functional are then input into a tight-binding model of twisted bilayer graphene, from which a single-particle continuum moir\'e-scale (Bistritzer-MacDonald-like) model is systematically derived. We then project this model together with a Coulomb electron-electron interaction term into the single-particle model's flat moir\'e bands. We numerically compute Hartree-Fock ground states of this model, comparing the relative energies of competing many-body ground states.</description>

      <title>Approximation and stability results for the parabolic FitzHugh-Nagumo system with combined rapidly oscillating sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of high-frequency currents in neurostimulation has received increased attention in recent years due to its varied effects on tissues and cells. Nonlinear differential equations are commonly used as models for Neurons, and averaging methods are suitable for addressing questions like stability when considering single-frequency sources. A recent strategy called temporal interference stimulation uses electrodes to deliver sinusoidal signals of slightly different frequencies. Thus, classical averaging cannot be directly applied. This paper considers the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo system under the effects of a source composed of two sinusoidal terms in time and decaying in space. We develop a new averaging strategy to show that the solution of the system can be approximated by an explicit highly-oscillatory term plus the solution of a simpler, non-autonomous system. One of the main novelties is an extension of the contracting rectangles method to the case of parabolic equations with space and time-depending coefficients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the long-time dynamics of point-vortex type systems near thermal equilibrium and to the possible emergence of collisional relaxation. More precisely, we consider a tagged particle coupled to a large number of background particles that are initially at equilibrium, and we analyze its resulting slow dynamics. On the one hand, in the spirit of the Lenard-Balescu relaxation for plasmas, we establish in a generic setting the outset of the slow thermalization of the tagged particle. On the other hand, we show that a completely different phenomenology is also possible in some degenerate regime: the slow dynamics of the tagged particle then remains conservative and the thermalization no longer holds in a strict sense. We provide the first detailed description of this degenerate regime and of its mixing properties. Note that it is particularly delicate to handle due to statistical closure problems, which manifest themselves as a lack of self-adjointness of the effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The discrete dislocation dynamics of multiple dislocation loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation that physically arises from the classical Peierls-Nabarro model for dislocations in crystalline structures. Our initial configuration corresponds to multiple slip loop dislocations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$. After suitably rescaling the equation with a small phase parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the rescaled solution solves a fractional Allen-Cahn equation. We show that, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, the limiting solution exhibits multiple interfaces evolving independently and according to their mean curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for a class of linear evolution equations of arbitrary order with coefficients depending both on time and space variables. Under suitable decay assumptions on the coefficients of the lower order terms for $|x|$ large, we prove a well-posedness result in Gevrey-type spaces.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the stochastic double-porosity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the homogenization of elliptic equations in high-contrast media in the so-called 'double-porosity' resonant regime, for which we solve two open problems of the literature. First, we prove qualitative stochastic homogenization under very weak conditions, which cover the case of inclusions that are not uniformly bounded or separated. Second, under stronger assumptions, we provide sharp error estimates for the two-scale expansion. The main difficulty is related to the loss of integrability of the control in the resonant zones.</description>

      <title>The regularity problem with a weaker condition on only the transversal direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that if the matrix $A$ is independent in the transversal $t$-direction, then the regularity boundary value problem is solvable with data in a Sobolev space. In the present paper we improve on the $t$-independence condition by introducing a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition that only depends on $\partial_t A$, the derivative of $A$ in transversal direction. This condition is different from other conditions in the literature and has already been proven to imply solvability of the Dirichlet boundary value problem.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Complex Hessian measures with respect to a background Hermitian form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop potential theory for $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a Hermitian metric on a Hermitian manifold. First, we show that the complex Hessian operator is well-defined for bounded functions in this class. This allows to define the $m$-capacity and then showing the quasi-continuity of $m$-subharmonic functions. Thanks to this we derive other results parallel to those in pluripotential theory such as the equivalence between polar sets and negligible sets. The theory is then used to study the complex Hessian equation on compact Hermitian manifold with boundary, with the right hand side of the equation admitting a bounded subsolution. This is an extension of a recent result of Collins and Picard dealing with classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for a finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff dimension of planar elliptic measures via quasiconformal mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain new bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of planar elliptic measure via the application of quasiconformal mappings, with these bounds depending solely on the ellipticity constant of the matrix. In fact, in our case studies, we find a quasiconformal mapping that relates the elliptic measure in a domain to the harmonic measure in its image domain, allowing us to deduce bounds for the dimension of the elliptic measure from the known results on the harmonic side. This extends previous works of Makarov, Jones and Wolff.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fucik spectra for the one-dimensional anisotropic p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)', \ \ a, b &gt; 0. \] We characterize completely the set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions in terms of the corresponding ones for the classical one-dimensional $p$-Laplace operator and establish that only the eigenfunctions associated to the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ have definite sign and, furthermore, its eigenspace is formed precisely by two non-collinear half-lines in $C^1[0,L]$ if and only if $a \neq b$. Our approach also allows to characterize the Fu\v c\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ from a disjoint enumerate union of hyperboles related to the classical counterpart and mainly the corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$ and $a \neq b$ which correspond to nonlinear anisotropic operators.</description>

      <title>Second Quantization and Evolution Operators in infinite dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space $X$, we study compactness properties and the hypercontractivity of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution operators $P_{s,t}$ in the spaces $L^p(X,\gamma_t)$, $\{\gamma_t\}_{t\in\R}$ being a suitable evolution system of measures for $P_{s,t}$. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of $P_{s,t}$. Our results are produced thanks to a representation formula for $P_{s,t}$ through the second quantization operator. Among the examples, we consider the transition evolution operator associated to a non-autonomous stochastic parabolic PDE.</description>

Abstract: We describe the transformation of a polynomial planar dynamical system into a second order differential equation by means of a polynomial change of variables. We then, by means of the Krylov-Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky averaging method, identify sufficient conditions involving said change of variables so that a limit cycle exists.</description>
