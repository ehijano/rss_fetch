      <title>mRadNet: A Compact Radar Object Detector with MetaFormer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16223v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and FLOPs.</description>

      <title>Power Spectral Density Estimation via Universal Truncated Order Statistics Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loud transient signals in underwater acoustic data increase the bias and variance of background noise power spectral density (PSD) estimates based on sample mean. Recently, two PSD estimators mitigated the loud transient impact on PSD estimates by applying order statistics filtering (OSF). The first, the Schwock and Abadi Welch Percentile, scales a single rank order statistic (OS) of consecutive periodograms. The second, the truncated linear order statistics filter, is a weighted sum of OS up to a chosen rank. In order to minimize variance, both OSFs must carefully choose the highest rank that still eliminates the loud transients. However, in real-time applications in dynamic environments, loud transients occur at unpredictable rates, requiring dynamic adjustment of the OSF ranks to keep low bias and variance. To circumvent the challenges of real-time rank selection, this paper proposes a convex sum of OSFs across ranks with blending weights that are sequentially adjusted to favor the lowest variance OSFs over a recent time window. The performance of the blended sum provably approaches the performance of the best fixed rank OSF. Simulations and real data confirm the blended OSFs effectively filter loud transients out of spectrograms without explicitly choosing a threshold rank.</description>

      <title>Hybrid FIM and STAR-BD-RIS-Aided Wireless Communications with Short Packet Length: A Meta-TD3 Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIM) have been widely adopted in multi-user wireless communication systems to enhance channel quality through simultaneous transmission and reflection of signals and three-dimensional reconfiguration of antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel system architecture that integrates the benefits of both technologies by deploying an FIM antenna at the base station (BS) and a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal RIS (STAR-BD-RIS) along the transmission path to ensure sufficient received power for single-antenna users. The objective is to maximize the achievable sum rate considering the short block length by jointly optimizing the FIM surface configuration, the transmit beamforming vector, and STAR-BD-RIS phase shift matrix subject to practical constraints including minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), power limitations, FIM constraint, and the STAR-BD-RIS phase-shift matrix. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we develop a learning-based approach that incorporates meta-learning into the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, referred to as Meta-TD3. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid system outperforms conventional configurations employing either FIM or RIS alone, while the Meta-TD3 algorithm achieves superior performance compared to classic learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Advancing Accessible Hand-Arm Vibration Safety Monitoring: ISO-Compliance with Wearable Sensors and Transfer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field workers are frequently exposed to hazardous vibrations, increasing the risk of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and other long-term health problems. ISO 5349-1 provides guidelines for measuring vibration exposure. However, this standard was established in controlled conditions using high-quality accelerometers directly attached to power tool handles. This study investigates an alternative, wearable sensor-based data collection process and develops an error-minimization transfer function that derives values comparable to ISO benchmarks for safety monitoring. Experiments are performed with subjects hammer drilling into concrete while vibrations are measured using three accelerometers at different sampling frequencies. The transfer function maps vibration data across sensor positions by accounting for damping effects. The findings indicate a significant reduction in acceleration between the palm and upper arm, highlight the impact of sampling frequency on data accuracy, and enable accurate comparison of true hand-arm vibration levels with existing standard limits to allow accessible, real-time, and cost-effective HAVS prevention.</description>

      <title>Bearing-only Tracking using Towed Sensor-Array with Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive bearing-only tracking (BOT) estimates the target states by utilising noisy bearing measurements captured by a sensor array. The sensor array is often towed behind the ship, using a long flexible cable to reduce interference from the own-ship's inherent noises. This forms a towed cable sensor-array system (TCSAS). During BOT, the tow-ship has to perform a manoeuvre to make the tracking system observable. Such a manoeuvre destabilises the TCSAS, thus making its exact location unknown \emph{w.r.t.} tow-ship. However, it is very crucial to know the exact location of the towed sensor-array to perform efficient and reliable target state estimation. The existing BOT approaches perform TMA during own-ship manoeuvre either by pausing the measurement updation step of the estimation algorithm or assuming a fixed aft position for the towed sensor-array. These assumptions lead to unreliable state estimation. To address this, we propose a dynamic model for TCSAS, using a lumped mass approach, which will provide the location of the sensor array during the own-ship manoeuvre. This location will be fed to the state estimation algorithm. The dynamic of TCSAS in 3D space is obtained by solving the equations obtained from the moment balance condition and quasi-static equilibrium condition at the lumped mass points. Moreover, the bearing data captured by the towed sensor-array is corrupted with non-Gaussian noise. It is handled using the maximum correntropy criterion based Kalman filter with a kernel bandwidth selection technique, proposed in this paper. The proposed sensor-array dynamic model is verified for a real-world BOT engagement scenario.</description>

      <title>Fusing Spectral Correlation Density Imaging with Deep Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis in Rotating Machinery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is critical for ensuring operational reliability, therefore early fault detection is essential to avoid catastrophic failures and expensive emergency repairs. Traditional methods like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) often fail to capture the complex, non-stationary nature of vibration signals. This study leverages the cyclostationary properties of vibration data through Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) images to enhance fault detection and apply deep learning for classification. Using a publicly available dataset with bearing faults seeded in two distinct housings (A and B) under varying load conditions (0 Nm, 2 Nm, 4 Nm), we processed vibration signals into 2D SCD images to reveal fault-specific periodicities, such as broadband spectra (2000--8000 Hz) for larger faults. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, Custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetB0, were developed to classify seven bearing conditions. The custom CNN achieved the highest accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.95\% on Housing A and B, respectively, followed by ResNet152V2 at 96.49\% and 95.35\%, and EfficientNetB0 at 94.16\% and 91.65\%, respectively. The models' high accuracies across different housings demonstrate a robust solution suitable for cost-effective condition monitoring deployable near sensing platforms, contributing to applied machine learning for edge intelligence and showcasing effective signal processing strategies for handling complex, potentially large-scale vibration data.</description>

      <title>Robust Sparse Subspace Tracking from Corrupted Data Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace tracking is a fundamental problem in signal processing, where the goal is to estimate and track the underlying subspace that spans a sequence of data streams over time. In high-dimensional settings, data samples are often corrupted by non-Gaussian noises and may exhibit sparsity. This paper explores the alpha divergence for sparse subspace estimation and tracking, offering robustness to data corruption. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art robust subspace tracking methods while achieving a low computational complexity and memory storage. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness in robust subspace tracking and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.</description>

      <title>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Communication and Channel Sounding: Requirements, Challenges, and Key Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel models are crucial for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation, and deployment of wireless communication systems. Traditional channel sounding systems are insufficient for handling the dynamic changes of channels in the next-generation space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSIN), which often results in outdated channel models that fail to provide reliable prior information for communication systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an integrated channel sounding and communication (ICSC) method as a practical solution. Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a full delay-Doppler representation of the channel, achieving optimal diversity in time-frequency doubly dispersive channels and effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges. Thus, we investigate the fundamental principles of AFDM, showing how it enables simultaneous communication and channel sounding, and explore key performance metrics for both functionalities. We also clarify the distinction and relationship between channel sounding, estimation, tracking and scatterer sensing. Additionally, several potential application scenarios for AFDM-ICSC are explored. Finally, we highlight the key challenges in implementing AFDM-ICSC, outline future research directions, and provide valuable insights for the continued development of this technology.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation with ELAA Modular Arrays Under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) enable high spatial resolution and multiplexing, especially for user equipments (UEs) in the radiative near-field. To reduce hardware cost, modular ELAA architectures with distributed baseband units (BBUs) are gaining traction. This paper addresses near-field line-of-sight (LOS) channel estimation under low noise amplifier (LNA)-induced hardware impairments in such modular systems. We propose computationally efficient estimators that exploit the array geometry and constant-modulus structure of near-field LOS channels, including a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) masking technique that improves estimation accuracy and significantly reduces fronthaul signaling. Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the conventional least squares (LS) method.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Two-Stage IRS-Aided Sumrate Maximization with Inexact Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose iZoSGA, a data-driven learning algorithm for joint passive long-term intelligent reflective surface (IRS)-aided beamforming and active short-term precoding in wireless networks. iZoSGA is based on a zeroth-order stochastic quasigradient ascent methodology designed for tackling two-stage nonconvex stochastic programs with continuous uncertainty and objective functions with "black-box" terms, and where second-stage optimization is inexact. As such, iZoSGA utilizes inexact precoding oracles, enabling practical implementation when short-term (e.g., WMMSE-based) beamforming is solved approximately. The proposed method is agnostic to channel models or statistics, and applies to arbitrary IRS/network configurations. We prove non-asymptotic convergence of iZoSGA to a neighborhood of a stationary solution of the original exact problem under minimal assumptions. Our numerics confirm the efficacy iZoSGA in several "inexact regimes", enabling passive yet fully effective IRS operation in diverse and realistic IRS-aided scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Performance of Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently gained significant attention as a novel reconfigurable-antenna technology due to its exceptional capability of mitigating signal-propagation path loss. In this letter, we investigate the secrecy performance of a pinching-antenna system in the presence of an eavesdropper. In particular, we derive an approximate expression of the system's secrecy outage probability (SOP) with respect to the random locations of the legitimate user and eavesdropper and analyze its asymptotic behavior. Moreover, we derive a constant performance lower bound on the SOP of the considered system, i.e., $\frac{2\pi-1}{24}$, which is significantly lower than that of conventional fixed-position antenna systems, i.e., $0.5$. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the correctness of our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Graph Fractional Hilbert Transform: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph Hilbert transform (GHT) is a key tool in constructing analytic signals and extracting envelope and phase information in graph signal processing. However, its utility is limited by confinement to the graph Fourier domain, a fixed phase shift, information loss for real-valued spectral components, and the absence of tunable parameters. The graph fractional Fourier transform introduces domain flexibility through a fractional order parameter $\alpha$ but does not resolve the issues of phase rigidity and information loss. Inspired by the dual-parameter fractional Hilbert transform (FRHT) in classical signal processing, we propose the graph FRHT (GFRHT). The GFRHT incorporates a dual-parameter framework: the fractional order $\alpha$ enables analysis across arbitrary fractional domains, interpolating between vertex and spectral spaces, while the angle parameter $\beta$ provides adjustable phase shifts and a non-zero real-valued response ($\cos\beta$) for real eigenvalues, thereby eliminating information loss. We formally define the GFRHT, establish its core properties, and design a method for graph analytic signal construction, enabling precise envelope extraction and demodulation. Experiments on edge detection, anomaly identification, and speech classification demonstrate that GFRHT outperforms GHT, offering greater flexibility and superior performance in graph signal processing.</description>

      <title>Bi-modal Prediction and Transformation Coding for Compressing Complex Human Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For dynamic human motion sequences, the original KeyNode-Driven codec often struggles to retain compression efficiency when confronted with rapid movements or strong non-rigid deformations. This paper proposes a novel Bi-modal coding framework that enhances the flexibility of motion representation by integrating semantic segmentation and region-specific transformation modeling. The rigid transformation model (rotation &amp; translation) is extended with a hybrid scheme that selectively applies affine transformations-rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing-only to deformation-rich regions (e.g., the torso, where loose clothing induces high variability), while retaining rigid models elsewhere. The affine model is decomposed into minimal parameter sets for efficient coding and combined through a component selection strategy guided by a Lagrangian Rate-Distortion optimization. The results show that the Bi-modal method achieves more accurate mesh deformation, especially in sequences involving complex non-rigid motion, without compromising compression efficiency in simpler regions, with an average bit-rate saving of 33.81% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite communication system that employs massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for multicast transmission. By modeling the spatial distribution of ground users using a Poisson point process (PPP) and assuming a fixed-beam precoding is adopted, we find a closed-form expression for the asymptotical rate scaling law as a function of the number of antennas and the scaling factors of user density and multicast users. From the derived analytical expression, we reveal that the rate degradation caused by multicast transmission can be precisely compensated by increasing the user density accordingly.</description>

      <title>Functional WMMSE Algorithm for Continuous Aperture Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a functional extension of the weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm for downlink beamforming in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems where both the base station (BS) and the users employ continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs). The method lifts the matrices and vectors in the classical discrete WMMSE recursion to continuous functions by replacing matrix products and inner products with integrals over the apertures. In practice, we apply a Galerkin projection to map functions to coefficient matrices, solve the resulting discrete WMMSE problem via closed-form updates, and then lift these updates back to the functional domain. All integrals are implemented using Gauss-Legendre quadrature, which preserves the closed-form structure through weighted matrix products.

      <title>Resilient Signal Reflection under CSI Perturbations: A Robust Approach for Secure RIS Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology in wireless communication, enabling dynamic control over signal propagation. This paper tackles the challenge of mitigating Channel State Information (CSI) perturbations in RIS-aided systems, particularly for secure communication scenarios. Leveraging a first-order approximation technique, we develop a robust approach that strengthens the resilience of RIS configurations against CSI imperfections. The study considers both untrusted user interception and stealth radar applications, focusing on optimizing signal reflection and transmission in the presence of eavesdroppers. Simulation results demonstrate notable gains in security and efficiency while maintaining low computational complexity. By extending the stability range, the proposed method updates RIS elements using only a few matrix-vector multiplications, eliminating the need for repeated inverse or pseudo-inverse computations under small channel perturbations. Additionally, the framework provides a baseline for quantifying algorithmic sensitivity to CSI variations. Overall, the findings underscore the potential of RIS to enable secure and reliable communication in next-generation networks such as 6G.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Specific Gravity of Potato Tubers Using Dielectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potatoes are an economically important crop, and their quality is closely related to the starch content, which is typically inferred from specific gravity (SG). Although microwave sensing technologies have been increasingly developed for underground potato detection and quality assessment in recent years, no accurate model has yet been established to link the dielectric properties of potatoes with their key agronomic traits. To address this gap, we developed a model for estimating potato tubers' SG based on their dielectric constant. To construct and validate the model, we conducted SG measurements and dielectric spectroscopy measurements in the frequency range of 0.3 GHz to 3.0 GHz on 250 potatoes of five different types (red, russet, yellow, purple, and chipping potatoes, with 50 samples per type). Out of the 250 data sets, 200 data sets were used for model development, and 50 data sets were used for model validation. A linear regression model was used to summarize the relationship between SG and dielectric constant, where the regression coefficients are expressed as fourth-order polynomial functions of frequency. Experimental results on the 50 validation data sets show that the model achieves high estimation accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAE) less than \(4.8\times10^{-3}\) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) less than 0.45\%. The study of the dielectric properties of potatoes, along with the derived SG estimation model, provides a foundation for the future development of microwave sensing technologies for agronomic trait assessment in the potato production and processing industries. All measured data will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>On Mutual Information Neural Estimation for Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a promising candidate measure for the assessment and optimization of localization systems, as it captures nonlinear dependencies between random variables. However, the high cost of computing MI, especially for high-dimensional problems, prohibits its application for many real-world localization systems. We evaluate an algorithm from a new class of neural MI estimators called Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) to approximate the MI between the set of feasible user element (UE) locations and the corresponding set of measurements from said UE locations used for positioning. We apply this estimator to a simulated multilateration (MLAT) system, where the true MI for benchmarking can be approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. The estimator is experimentally evaluated w.r.t. its convergence and consistency and we investigate the usefulness of MI for assessing simple MLAT systems.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Capacity-Achieving Distributions for Discrete-Time Poisson Channel with Low-Precision ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) under dark current effects with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This study introduces an efficient optimization algorithm that integrates the Newton-Raphson and Blahut-Arimoto (BA) methods to determine the capacity-achieving input distribution and the corresponding amplitudes of input mass points for the DTPC, subject to both peak and average power constraints. Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are established to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the obtained capacity-achieving distribution. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm attains $72\%$ and $83\%$ of the theoretical capacity at 5 dB for 1-bit and 2-bit quantized DTPC, respectively. Furthermore, for a finite-precision quantized DTPC (i.e., ${\log _2}K$ bits), the capacity can be achieved by a non-uniform discrete input distribution with support for $K$ mass points, under the given power constraints.</description>

      <title>Single-Snapshot Localization Using Sparse Extremely Large Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates single-snapshot direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and target localization with coherent sparse extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) in automotive radar applications. Far-field and near-field signal models are formulated for distributed bistatic configurations. To enable noncoherent processing, a single-snapshot MUSIC (SS-MUSIC) algorithm is proposed to fuse local spectra from individual subarrays and extended to near-field localization via geometric intersection. For coherent processing, a single-snapshot ESPRIT (SS-ESPRIT) method with ambiguity dealiasing is developed to fully exploit the aperture of sparse ELAAs for high-resolution angle estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that SS-ESPRIT provides superior angular resolution for closely spaced far-field targets, while SS-MUSIC offers robustness in near-field localization and flexibility in hybrid scenarios.</description>

      <title>Predicting Chest Radiograph Findings from Electrocardiograms Using Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Chest X-rays are essential for diagnosing pulmonary conditions, but limited access in resource-constrained settings can delay timely diagnosis. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), in contrast, are widely available, non-invasive, and often acquired earlier in clinical workflows. This study aims to assess whether ECG features and patient demographics can predict chest radiograph findings using an interpretable machine learning approach.
  Methods: Using the MIMIC-IV database, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were trained to predict diverse chest radiograph findings from ECG-derived features and demographic variables. Recursive feature elimination was performed independently for each target to identify the most predictive features. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were applied to interpret feature contributions.
  Results: Models successfully predicted multiple chest radiograph findings with varying accuracy. Feature selection tailored predictors to each target, and including demographic variables consistently improved performance. SHAP analysis revealed clinically meaningful contributions from ECG features to radiographic predictions.
  Conclusion: ECG-derived features combined with patient demographics can serve as a proxy for certain chest radiograph findings, enabling early triage or pre-screening in settings where radiographic imaging is limited. Interpretable machine learning demonstrates potential to support radiology workflows and improve patient care.</description>

      <title>SSNet: Flexible and robust channel extrapolation for fluid antenna systems enabled by an self-supervised learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) signify a pivotal advancement in 6G communication by enhancing spectral efficiency and robustness. However, obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) in FAS poses challenges due to its complex physical structure. Traditional methods, such as pilot-based interpolation and compressive sensing, are not only computationally intensive but also lack adaptability. Current extrapolation techniques relying on rigid parametric models do not accommodate the dynamic environment of FAS, while data-driven deep learning approaches demand extensive training and are vulnerable to noise and hardware imperfections. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning network (SSNet) designed for efficient and adaptive channel extrapolation in FAS. We formulate the problem of channel extrapolation in FAS as an image reconstruction task. Here, a limited number of unmasked pixels (representing the known CSI of the selected ports) are used to extrapolate the masked pixels (the CSI of unselected ports). SSNet capitalizes on the intrinsic structure of FAS channels, learning generalized representations from raw CSI data, thus reducing dependency on large labelled datasets. For enhanced feature extraction and noise resilience, we propose a mix-of-expert (MoE) module. In this setup, multiple feedforward neural networks (FFNs) operate in parallel. The outputs of the MoE module are combined using a weighted sum, determined by a gating function that computes the weights of each FFN using a softmax function. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of the proposed model. Results indicate that SSNet significantly outperforms benchmark models, such as AGMAE and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks by using a much smaller labelled dataset.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Joint Pilot Allocation and Sequence Design for MIMO-OFDM Systems With Channel Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint optimization of pilot subcarrier allocation and non-orthogonal sequence for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under compressed sensing (CS)-based channel estimation exploiting delay and angle sparsity. Since the performance of CS-based approaches depends on a coherence metric of the sensing matrix in the measurement process, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize this coherence. Due to the discrete nature of subcarrier allocation, a straightforward formulation of the joint optimization results in a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is computationally intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of allocation candidates. To overcome the intractability of discrete variables, we introduce a block sparse penalty for pilots across all subcarriers, which ensures that the power of some unnecessary pilots approaches zero. This framework enables joint optimization using only continuous variables. In addition, we propose an efficient computation method for the coherence metric by exploiting the structure of the sensing matrix, which allows its gradient to be derived in closed form, making the joint optimization problem solvable in an efficient way via a gradient descent approach. Numerical results confirm that the proposed pilot sequence exhibits superior coherence properties and enhances the CS-based channel estimation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of making generative models suitable for resource-constrained environments like mobile wireless communication systems. We propose a generative model that integrates Autoregressive (AR) parameterization into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for modeling Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS) processes. By exploiting model-based insights allowing for structural constraints, the approach significantly reduces parameters while maintaining high modeling accuracy. Channel estimation experiments show that the model can outperform standard GMMs and variants using Toeplitz or circulant covariances, particularly with small sample sizes. For larger datasets, it matches the performance of conventional methods while improving computational efficiency and reducing the memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Bridge Micro-Deformation Monitoring Scheme with Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) scheme to perform bridge micro-deformation monitoring (BMDM) in complex environments. We first provide an excitation-bridge coupling model to represent the micro-deformation process of the bridge. Next, we design a novel frame structure for BMDM applications, and construct the OFDM echo channel model for basic scene of BMDM, including micro-deformation, dynamic objects, and static environment. Then, we develop a phasor statistical analysis method based on average cancellation algorithm to suppress the interference of dynamic objects, as well as a circle fitting method based on least squares algorithm to remove the interference of static environment near the monitoring area. Furthermore, we extract the micro-deformation feature vector from the OFDM echo signals after inverse discrete fourier transform (IDFT), and derive vertical micro-deformation value with the time-frequency phase resources. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BMDM scheme and its robustness against both dynamic interferences and static interferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1705.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new frequency switching receiver structure is proposed for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-carrier communication systems. Each subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the information decoding unit, according to the optimal subcarrier allocation. To implement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two optimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and solved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using continuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the performance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based model is better than existing models in a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1705.10514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RF energy harvesting (RFEH) is a promising technology for energy requirements of wireless communication nodes. However, providing sufficient amount of energy to ensure self-sufficient devices based on RFEH may be challenging. In this paper, the use of diversity combining in RFEH systems is proposed to increase the amount of harvested energy. The power consumption of diversity combining process is also taken into account to analyze the net benefit of diversity combining. Performances of RFEH systems are investigated for selection combining (SC), equal gain combining (EGC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC) techniques. Simulations are conducted to compare the numerical results of SC, EGC, and MRC, and the results show that although the diversity combining techniques can improve the energy harvesting performance, the power consumption parameters have a critical importance while determining the suitable technique.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Interoperable Platform for Transforming Building Information with Brick Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital twin and building information era, many building automation companies searched for scalable methods to extract and analyze different building data, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, actuators, layout sections, zones, etc. The necessity for engineers to continuously manage the entire process for each new building creates scalability challenges. Furthermore, because construction information is sensitive, transferring data on vendor platforms via the cloud creates problems. This paper introduces a platform designed to address some of the common challenges in building automation. This is a smart platform designed for the transformation of building information into Brick ontology (Brick 2020) and graph formats. This technology makes it easy to retrieve historical data and converts the building point list into a Brick schema model for use in digital twin applications. The overarching goal of the proposed platform development is semi-automate the process while offering adaptability to various building configurations. This platform uses Brick schema and graph data structure techniques to minimize complexity, offering a semi-automated approach through its use of a tree-based graph structure. Moreover, the integration of Brick ontology creates a common language for interoperability and improves building information management. The seamless and offline integration of historical data within the developed platform minimizes data security risks when handling building information.</description>

      <title>Sound field estimation with moving microphones using kernel ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound field estimation with moving microphones can increase flexibility, decrease measurement time, and reduce equipment constraints compared to using stationary microphones. In this paper a sound field estimation method based on kernel ridge regression (KRR) is proposed for moving microphones. The proposed KRR method is constructed using a discrete time continuous space sound field model based on the discrete Fourier transform and the Herglotz wave function. The proposed method allows for the inclusion of prior knowledge as a regularization penalty, similar to kernel-based methods with stationary microphones, which is novel for moving microphones. Using a directional weighting for the proposed method, the sound field estimates are improved, which is demonstrated on both simulated and real data. Due to the high computational cost of sound field estimation with moving microphones, an approximate KRR method is proposed, using random Fourier features (RFF) to approximate the kernel. The RFF method is shown to decrease computational cost while obtaining less accurate estimates compared to KRR, providing a trade-off between cost and performance.</description>

      <title>Learned Digital Codes for Over-the-Air Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables distributed model training across wireless devices without centralising raw data, but deployment is constrained by the wireless uplink. A promising direction is over-the-air (OTA) aggregation, which merges communication with computation. Existing digital OTA methods can achieve either strong convergence or robustness to noise, but struggle to achieve both simultaneously, limiting performance in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where many IoT devices operate. This work proposes a learnt digital OTA framework that extends reliable operation into low-SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art. The proposed method combines an unrolled decoder with a jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook. Results show an extension of reliable operation by more than 7 dB, with improved global model convergence across all SNR levels, highlighting the potential of learning-based design for FEEL.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion Models: Novel Analysis and New Sampler Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Tolerance of Phase Noise in Single-Carrier M-Ary QAM Terahertz Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz wireless communications offer abundant untapped spectrum and are regarded as a promising playground for next-generation high-throughput links. Yet oscillator phase noise becomes the dominant impairment at such high frequencies, severely limiting the reliability of high-order QAM transmission. Here, phase noise is reconstructed from measured spectra and embedded into a single-carrier link model to evaluate its impact. Distinct distortion mechanisms are identified, with slow common phase error and instantaneous phase jitter, where the latter remains as the residual impairment after carrier phase recovery. We further adopt 3{\sigma} error criterion that maps residual distortions onto the constellation, offering a clear and practical indicator of system robustness. The results indicate that modest improvements in oscillator stability translate into significant BER gains without proportional power increase. These findings provide intuitive tolerance of phase noise in M-QAM systems and emphasizes the importance of integrating low-noise photonic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography for Tensor Networks in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>SignalLLM: A General-Purpose LLM Agent Framework for Automated Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven, often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge, in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce U-shaped encoder-decoder graph neural networks (U-GNNs) for stochastic graph signal generation using denoising diffusion processes. The architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening, with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount -- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic forecasting of stock prices.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Operator Learning for Hemodynamic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766 vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.</description>

      <title>FUN-SSL: Full-band Layer Followed by U-Net with Narrow-band Layers for Multiple Moving Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17490v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-path processing along the temporal and spectral dimensions has shown to be effective in various speech processing applications. While the sound source localization (SSL) models utilizing dual-path processing such as the FN-SSL and IPDnet demonstrated impressive performances in localizing multiple moving sources, they require significant amount of computation. In this paper, we propose an architecture for SSL which introduces a U-Net to perform narrow-band processing in multiple resolutions to reduce computational complexity. The proposed model replaces the full-narrow network block in the IPDnet consisting of one full-band LSTM layer along the spectral dimension followed by one narrow-band LSTM layer along the temporal dimension with the FUN block composed of one Full-band layer followed by a U-net with Narrow-band layers in multiple scales. On top of the skip connections within each U-Net, we also introduce the skip connections between FUN blocks to enrich information. Experimental results showed that the proposed FUN-SSL outperformed previously proposed approaches with computational complexity much lower than that of the IPDnet.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Nonsmooth Weakly Convex Function over Prox-regular Set for Robust Low-rank Matrix Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a prox-regular-type low-rank constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization model for Robust Low-Rank Matrix Recovery (RLRMR), i.e., estimate problem of low-rank matrix from an observed signal corrupted by outliers. For RLRMR, the $\ell_{1}$-norm has been utilized as a convex loss to detect outliers as well as to keep tractability of optimization models. Nevertheless, the $\ell_{1}$-norm is not necessarily an ideal robust loss because the $\ell_{1}$-norm tends to overpenalize entries corrupted by outliers of large magnitude. In contrast, the proposed model can employ a weakly convex function as a more robust loss, against outliers, than the $\ell_{1}$-norm. For the proposed model, we present (i) a projected variable smoothing-type algorithm applicable for the minimization of a nonsmooth weakly convex function over a prox-regular set, and (ii) a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of stationary point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with the existing models that employ the $\ell_{1}$-norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible, uncertainty-aware framework for modeling complex signals, but scale cubically with data, assume static targets, and are brittle to outliers, limiting their applicability in large-scale problems with dynamic and noisy environments. Recent work introduced decentralized random Fourier feature Gaussian processes (DRFGP), an online and distributed algorithm that casts GPs in an information-filter form, enabling exact sequential inference and fully distributed computation without reliance on a fusion center. In this paper, we extend DRFGP along two key directions: first, by introducing a robust-filtering update that downweights the impact of atypical observations; and second, by incorporating a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adapts to time-varying functions. The resulting algorithm retains the recursive information-filter structure while enhancing stability and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale Earth system application, underscoring its potential for in-situ modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for humanoid locomotion is appealing for its compact perception-action mapping, yet practical policies often suffer from training instability, inefficient feature fusion, and high actuation cost. We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</description>

      <title>RadarSFD: Single-Frame Diffusion with Pretrained Priors for Radar Point Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar provides perception robust to fog, smoke, dust, and low light, making it attractive for size, weight, and power constrained robotic platforms. Current radar imaging methods, however, rely on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation to improve resolution, which is impractical for small aerial, inspection, or wearable systems. We present RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame without motion or SAR. Our approach transfers geometric priors from a pretrained monocular depth estimator into the diffusion backbone, anchors them to radar inputs via channel-wise latent concatenation, and regularizes outputs with a dual-space objective combining latent and pixel-space losses. On the RadarHD benchmark, RadarSFD achieves 35 cm Chamfer Distance and 28 cm Modified Hausdorff Distance, improving over the single-frame RadarHD baseline (56 cm, 45 cm) and remaining competitive with multi-frame methods using 5-41 frames. Qualitative results show recovery of fine walls and narrow gaps, and experiments across new environments confirm strong generalization. Ablation studies highlight the importance of pretrained initialization, radar BEV conditioning, and the dual-space loss. Together, these results establish the first practical single-frame, no-SAR mmWave radar pipeline for dense point cloud perception in compact robotic systems.</description>

      <title>FSOS-AMC: Few-Shot Open-Set Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification Over Multipath Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in advancing future wireless communication networks. Although deep learning (DL)-based AMC frameworks have demonstrated remarkable classification capabilities, they typically require large-scale training datasets and assume consistent class distributions between training and testing data-prerequisites that prove challenging in few-shot and open-set scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel few-shot open-set AMC (FSOS-AMC) framework that integrates a multisequence multiscale attention network (MS-MSANet), meta-prototype training, and a modular open-set classifier. The MS-MSANet extracts features from multisequence input signals, while meta-prototype training optimizes both the feature extractor and the modular open-set classifier, which can effectively categorize testing data into known modulation types or identify potential unknown modulations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our FSOS-AMC framework achieves superior performance in few-shot open-set scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the framework exhibits higher classification accuracy for both known and unknown modulations, as validated by improved accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) metrics. Moreover, the proposed framework demonstrates remarkable robustness under challenging low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of communication and sensing functions within mmWave systems has gained attention due to the potential for enhanced passive sensing and improved communication reliability. State-of-the-art techniques separate these two functions in frequency, use of hardware, or time, i.e., sending known preambles for channel sensing or unknown symbols for communications. In this paper, we introduce Panoptic, a novel system architecture for integrated communication and sensing sharing the same hardware, frequency, and time resources. Panoptic jointly detects unknown symbols and channel components from data-modulated signals. The core idea is a new beam manipulation technique, which we call compressive sidelobe forming, that maintains a directional mainlobe toward the intended communication nodes while acquiring unique spatial information through pseudorandom sidelobe perturbations. We implemented Panoptic on 60 GHz mmWave radios and conducted extensive over-the-air experiments. Our results show that Panoptic achieves reflector angular localization error of less than 2\deg while at the same time supporting mmWave data communication with a negligible BER penalty when compared with conventional communication-only mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>GNN Design for Learning HMIMO Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) has emerged as a potential technique for enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining low hardware costs and power consumption. Conventional alternating optimization algorithms have been widely employed to design HMIMO beamforming, but their high computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a learning-based alternative with low inference time. However, in HMIMO systems, the fixed phase pattern, which captures the distribution of reference-wave phases across the holographic surface disrupts the permutation equivariance (PE) property, which is essential for GNN design. To address this issue, we reformulate the beamforming problem into a PE-compliant equivalent form and propose a novel network architecture consisting of a gradient-based GNN (GGNN) followed by two projection modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher SE with significantly reduced inference time than alternating optimization methods and exhibits superior generalizability compared to other learning-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Practical Demonstrations of FR3-Band Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Acoustic Filter Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents an approach to control the operating frequency and fractional bandwidth (FBW) of miniature acoustic filters in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). More specifically, we used first-order antisymmetric (A1) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs) to achieve efficient operation at 20.5 GHz. Our technique leverages the thickness-dependent resonant frequency of A1 XBARs, combined with the in-plane anisotropic properties of 128$^\circ$ Y-cut TFLN, to customize filter characteristics. The implemented three-element ladder filter prototype achieves an insertion loss (IL) of only 1.79 dB and a controlled 3-dB FBW of 8.58% at 20.5 GHz, with an out-of-band (OoB) rejection greater than 14.9 dB across the entire FR3 band, while featuring a compact footprint of 0.90 $\times$ 0.74 mm2. Moreover, an eight-element filter prototype shows an IL of 3.80 dB, an FBW of 6.12% at 22.0 GHz, and a high OoB rejection of 22.97 dB, demonstrating the potential for expanding to higher-order filters. As frequency allocation requirements become more stringent in future FR3 bands, our technique showcases promising capability in enabling compact and monolithic filter banks toward next-generation acoustic filters for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of RSMA to Adversarial BD-RIS-Induced Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems to interference attacks against channel acquisition induced by beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs). Two primary attack strategies, random and aligned interference, are proposed for fully connected and group-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures. Valid random reflection coefficients are generated exploiting the Takagi factorization, while potent aligned interference attacks are achieved through optimization strategies based on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) reformulation followed by projections onto the unitary manifold. Our numerical findings reveal that, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, RSMA behaves similarly to space-division multiple access (SDMA) and thus is highly susceptible to the attack, with BD-RIS inducing severe performance loss and significantly outperforming diagonal RIS. However, under imperfect CSI, RSMA consistently demonstrates significantly greater robustness than SDMA, particularly as the system's transmit power increases.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of integer programming models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.</description>

      <title>Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.</description>

      <title>On the Deployment of Multiple Radio Stripes for Large-Scale Near-Field RF Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii) antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile, the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular coverage.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sparse Antenna Arrays for Localization and Sensing using Vector Spherical Wave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In increasing number of electronic devices implement wideband radio technologies for localization and sensing purposes, like ultra-wideband (UWB). Such radio technologies benefit from a large number of antennas, but space for antennas is often limited, especially in devices for mobile and IoT applications. A common challenge is therefore to optimize the placement and orientations of a small number of antenna elements inside a device, leading to the best localization performance. We propose a method for systematically approaching the optimization of such sparse arrays by means of Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) and vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs). The VSWFs form the basis of a wideband signal model considering frequency, direction and polarization-dependent characteristics of the antenna array under test (AUT), together with mutual coupling and distortions from surrounding obstacles. We derive the CRLBs for localization parameters like delay and angle-of-arrival for this model under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, and formulate optimization problems for determining optimal antenna positions and orientations via minimization of the CRLBs. The proposed optimization procedure is demonstrated by means of an exemplary arrangement of three Crossed Exponentially Tapered Slot (XETS) antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affective computing has garnered the attention and interest of researchers in recent years, as there is a need for AI systems to better understand and react to human emotions. However, analyzing human emotions, such as mood or stress, is quite complex. While various stress studies use facial expressions and wearables, most existing datasets rely on processing data from a single modality. This paper presents EmpathicSchool, a novel dataset that captures facial expressions and the associated physiological signals, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature, under different stress levels. The data was collected from 30 participants during different sessions for about ninety minutes each (for a total of 40 hours). The data includes seven different signal types, including both computer vision and physiological features that can be used to detect stress. In addition, various experiments were conducted to validate the signal quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01153v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we present the classical exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for solving the MLE problem, which suffers from numerical instability when applied to correlated channels. We propose a computationally efficient inexact CD algorithm by approximating the objective function, which approximately solves the one-dimensional subproblem and improves both computational efficiency and numerical stability. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Finally, we study the MLE model in the joint device activity and data detection context. Simulation results demonstrate the computational performance of the presented algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .</description>

      <title>A Simple Review of EEG Foundation Models: Datasets, Advancements and Future Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play a crucial role in understanding brain activity and diagnosing neurological diseases. Because supervised EEG encoders are unable to learn robust EEG patterns and rely too heavily on expensive signal annotation, research has turned to general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, known as EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), to achieve robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the readiness of early EEG-FMs for practical applications and the standards for long-term research progress remain unclear. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is necessary to understand their current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To this end, this study reviews 14 early EEG-FMs and provides a critical comprehensive analysis of their methodologies, empirical findings, and unaddressed research gaps. This review focuses on the latest developments in EEG-based models (EEG-FMs), which have shown great potential for processing and analyzing EEG data. We discuss various EEG-FMs, including their architectures, pretraining strategies, pretraining and downstream datasets, and other details. This review also highlights challenges and future directions in the field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners interested in EEG analysis and related EEG-FM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a supervised training algorithm for learning stochastic resource allocation policies with generative diffusion models (GDMs). We formulate the allocation problem as the maximization of an ergodic utility function subject to ergodic Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Given samples from a stochastic expert policy that yields a near-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem, we train a GDM policy to imitate the expert and generate new samples from the optimal distribution. We achieve near-optimal performance through the sequential execution of the generated samples. To enable generalization to a family of network configurations, we parameterize the backward diffusion process with a graph neural network (GNN) architecture. We present numerical results in a case study of power control.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22286</link>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.</description>

      <title>Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from eight major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Power-Dominance in Estimation Theory: A Third Pathological Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for estimation theory by introducing a second-order diagnostic for estimator design. While classical analysis focuses on the bias-variance trade-off, we present a more foundational constraint. This result is model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and is valid for both parametric and non-parametric problems, Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We propose to classify the estimators into three primary power regimes. We theoretically establish that any estimator operating in the `power-dominant regime' incurs an unavoidable mean-squared error penalty, making it structurally prone to sub-optimal performance. We propose a `safe-zone law' and make this diagnostic intuitive through two safe-zone maps. One map is a geometric visualization analogous to a receiver operating characteristic curve for estimators, and the other map shows that the safe-zone corresponds to a bounded optimization problem, while the forbidden `power-dominant zone' represents an unbounded optimization landscape. This framework reframes estimator design as a path optimization problem, providing new theoretical underpinnings for regularization and inspiring novel design philosophies.</description>
