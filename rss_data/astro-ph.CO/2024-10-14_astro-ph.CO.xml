      <title>First Ly$\alpha$ 1D Bispectrum Measurement in eBOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first robust measurement of the one-dimensional Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest bispectrum using the complete extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) quasar sample, corresponding to the sixteenth data release (DR16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The measurement employs an FFT estimator over 12 redshift bins, ranging from $z=2.2$ to $z=4.4$, and extends to scales of $0.02 ~ (\mathrm{km/s})^{-1}$. The sample consists of 122,066 quasar spectra, although only the first six redshift bins contain sufficient data to extract a physical bispectrum. To validate and correct the bispectrum measurement, we use synthetic datasets generated from lognormal and 2LPT mocks. Additionally, we detect clear evidence of correlations between Si$_\mathrm{III}$ absorption lines and the Ly$\alpha$ forest within the bispectrum signal, which we describe with an extension of the model used for the analogue of 1d power spectrum signal. In this context, the pipeline developed for this study addresses the impact of instrumental and methodological systematics and is ready for application to larger spectroscopic datasets, such as those from the first year of DESI observations. Finally, A simple perturbation theory model provides a reasonable explanation of the eBOSS bispectrum, suggesting that higher-order one-dimensional statistics in the Ly$\alpha$ forest can complement cosmological model inference based on the power spectrum in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme magnification of stars near the caustics of clusters allow to detect individual luminous stars at high redshift. We show how deep exposures of caustic crossing galaxies at $z\lesssim1$ with IR telescopes such as JWST, can detect non-explosive distance calibrators, such as Cepheids, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch or stars in the tip of the red giant branch. A large number of such detections, combined with careful modelling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to using them as alternative standard candles to SNe in a redshift range that would extend the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude for these distance calibrators. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures provide also a robust method of mapping small dark matter substructures since they cluster around the critical curves of small scale dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Search for non-virialized axions with 3.3-4.2 $\mu$eV mass at selected resolving powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment is sensitive to narrow axion flows, given axions compose a fraction of the dark matter with a non-negligible local density. Detecting these low-velocity dispersion flows requires a high spectral resolution and careful attention to the expected signal modulation due to Earth's motion. We report an exclusion on the local axion dark matter density in narrow flows of $\rho_a \gtrsim 0.03\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ and $\rho_a \gtrsim 0.004\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ for Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitski and Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov axion-photon couplings, respectively, over the mass range $3.3-4.2\,\mu\text{eV}$. Measurements were made at selected resolving powers to allow for a range of possible velocity dispersions.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey : Constraints on the structure growth from cluster number counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond testing the current cosmological paradigm, cluster number counts can also be utilized to investigate the discrepancies currently affecting current cosmological measurements. In particular, cosmological studies based on cosmic shear and other large-scale structure probes routinely find a value of the amplitude of the fluctuations in the universe S8 smaller than the one inferred from the primary cosmic microwave background. In this work, we investigate this tension by measuring structure evolution across cosmic time as probed by the number counts of the massive halos with the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey cluster catalog in the Western Galactic Hemisphere complemented with the overlapping Dark Energy Survey Year-3, KiloDegree Survey, and Hyper Suprime-Cam data for weak lensing mass calibration, by implementing two different parameterizations and a model-agnostic method. In the first model, we measure the cosmic linear growth index as {\gamma} = 1.19 \pm 0.21, in tension with the standard value of {\gamma} = 0.55, but in good statistical agreement with other large-scale structures probes. The second model is a phenomenological scenario in which we rescale the linear matter power spectrum at low redshift to investigate a potential reduction of structure formation, providing similar results. Finally, in a third strategy, we consider a standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, but we separate the cluster catalog into five redshift bins, measuring the cosmological parameters in each and inferring the evolution of the structure formation, finding hints of a reduction. Interestingly, the S8 value inferred from eRASS1 cluster number counts, when we add a degree of freedom to the matter power spectrum, recovers the value inferred by cosmic shear studies.</description>

      <title>Connecting Inflation to the NANOGrav 15-year Data Set via Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) missions have reported convincing evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background within their latest datasets. This background could originate from an astrophysical source, though there are multiple possibilities for its origin to be cosmological. Focusing on the NANOGrav signal, which was in good agreement with other PTAs, we evaluate the possibility of an inflationary source for the background. However, we'll consider a time-dependent minimal theory of massive gravity instead of standard general relativity for our analysis. We find that an inflationary interpretation will require a strongly blue spectrum, characterized by $n_T = 1.8 \, \pm \, 0.54$, while Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits will require a low reheating scale of $T_\text{rh} \simeq 4000 \ \text{GeV}$. Though these constraints make it difficult for inflation to be the source of the NANOGrav signal, we find that the massive gravity model allows for a greater reheating temperature than standard general relativity, making an inflationary interpretation slightly less cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations.</description>

      <title>Testing interacting dark energy with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys through differentiable neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a novel framework for accelerated cosmological inference, based on neural emulators and gradient-based sampling methods, to forecast constraints on dark energy models from Stage IV cosmic shear surveys. We focus on dark scattering (DS), an interacting dark energy model with pure momentum exchange in the dark sector, and train COSMOPOWER emulators to accurately and efficiently model the DS non-linear matter power spectrum produced by the halo model reaction framework, including the effects of baryon feedback and massive neutrinos. We embed the emulators within a fully-differentiable pipeline for gradient-based cosmological inference for which the batch likelihood call is up to $O(10^5)$ times faster than with traditional approaches, producing parameter constraints from simulated Stage IV cosmic shear data running on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). We also perform model comparison on the output chains from the inference process, employing the learnt harmonic mean estimator implemented in the software HARMONIC. We investigate degeneracies between dark energy and systematics parameters and assess the impact of scale cuts on the final constraints. Assuming a DS model for the mock data vector, we find that a Stage IV survey cosmic shear analysis can constrain the DS amplitude parameter $A_{\mathrm{ds}}$ with an uncertainty roughly an order of magnitude smaller than current constraints from Stage III surveys, even after marginalising over baryonic feedback, intrinsic alignments and redshift distribution uncertainties. These results show great promise for constraining DS with Stage IV data; furthermore, our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to a wide range of dark energy and modified gravity models.</description>

      <title>Field-level cosmological model selection: field-level simulation-based inference for Stage IV cosmic shear can distinguish dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework that for the first time allows Bayesian model comparison to be performed for field-level inference of cosmological models. We achieve this by taking a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach using neural likelihood estimation, which we couple with the learned harmonic mean estimator in order to compute the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. We apply our framework to mock Stage IV cosmic shear observations to assess its effectiveness at distinguishing between various models of dark energy. If the recent DESI results that provided exciting hints of dynamical dark energy were indeed the true underlying model, our analysis shows Stage IV cosmic shear surveys could definitively detect dynamical dark energy. We also perform traditional power spectrum likelihood-based inference for comparison, which we find is not able to distinguish between dark energy models, highlighting the enhanced constraining power for model comparison of our field-level SBI approach.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 and DESI: Structure growth measurements from the cross-correlation of DESI Legacy Imaging galaxies and CMB lensing from ACT DR6 and \textit{Planck} PR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the growth of cosmic density fluctuations on large scales and across the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8$ through the cross-correlation of the ACT DR6 CMB lensing map and galaxies from the DESI Legacy Survey, using three galaxy samples spanning the redshifts of $0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.45$, $0.45 \lesssim z \lesssim0.6$, $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.8$. We adopt a scale cut where non-linear effects are negligible, so that the cosmological constraints are derived from the linear regime. We determine the amplitude of matter fluctuations over all three redshift bins using ACT data alone to be $S_8\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.772\pm0.040$ in a joint analysis combining the three redshift bins and ACT lensing alone. Using a combination of ACT and \textit{Planck} data we obtain $S_8=0.765\pm0.032$. The lowest redshift bin used is the least constraining and exhibits a $\sim2\sigma$ tension with the other redshift bins; thus we also report constraints excluding the first redshift bin, giving $S_8=0.785\pm0.033$ for the combination of ACT and \textit{Planck}. This result is in excellent agreement at the $0.3\sigma$ level with measurements from galaxy lensing, but is $1.8\sigma$ lower than predictions based on \textit{Planck} primary CMB data. Understanding whether this hint of discrepancy in the growth of structure at low redshifts arises from a fluctuation, from systematics in data, or from new physics, is a high priority for forthcoming CMB lensing and galaxy cross-correlation analyses.</description>

      <title>From UV-bright Galaxies to Early Disks: the Importance of Turbulent Star Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to $\sim 1\%$ per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^5$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.1$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the quasar main sequence: illuminating the complexity of active galactic nuclei and their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Eigenvector 1 schema, or the main sequence of quasars, was introduced as an analogous scheme to the HR diagram that would allow us to understand the more complex, extended sources - active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that harbor accreting supermassive black holes. The study has spanned more than three decades and has advanced our knowledge of the diversity of Type-1 AGNs from both observational and theoretical aspects. The quasar main sequence, in its simplest form, is the plane between the FWHM of the broad H$\beta$ emission line and the strength of the optical FeII emission to the H$\beta$. While the former allows the estimation of the black hole mass, the latter enables direct measurement of the metal content and traces the accretion rate of the AGN. Together, they allow us to track the evolution of AGN in terms of the activity of the central nuclei, its effect on the line-emitting regions surrounding the AGN, and their diversity making them suitable distance indicators to study the expansion of our Universe. This mini-review aims to provide (i) a brief history leading up to the present day in the study of the quasar main sequence, (ii) introduce us to the many possibilities to study AGNs with the main sequence as a guiding tool, and (iii) highlight some recent, exciting lines of researches at the frontier of this ever-growing field.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of the Milky Way's oldest stellar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains a mystery when our Milky Way first formed a stellar disk component that survived and maintained its disk structure from subsequent galaxy mergers. We present a study of the age-dependent structure and star formation rate of the Milky Way's disk using high-alpha stars with significant orbital angular momentum that have precise age determinations. Our results show that the radial scale length is nearly independent of age, while the vertical scale height experienced dramatic evolution. A disk-like geometry presents even for populations older than 13 Gyr, with the scale height-to-length ratio dropping below 0.5 for populations younger than 12.5 Gyr. We dub the oldest population that has maintained a disk geometry - apparently formed over 13 Gyr ago - PanGu. With an estimated present-day stellar mass of $2 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$, PanGu is presumed to be a major stellar component of our Galaxy in the earliest epoch. The total present-day stellar mass of the whole high-alpha disk is $2 \times 10^{10}$ $M_\odot$, mostly formed during a distinct star formation rate peak of 11 $M_\odot$ per year around 11 Gyrs ago. A comparison with Milky Way analogs in the TNG50 simulations implies that our Galaxy has experienced an exceptionally quiescent dynamical history, even before the Gaia-Enceladus merger.</description>

      <title>Partially Ionized Gas at Equilibrium Powered by Ultraviolet Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of a partially ionized zone behind the usual H II zone in photo-ionized gas. While Lyman continuum photons are depleted before reaching this zone, Balmer continuum photons can ionize the $n=2$ hydrogen atoms as those are pumped by scattering-trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. Ly$\alpha$ photons need to be replenished in a steady state, but fast radiative cooling at high gas temperature makes replenishment through electron collisional excitation of $n=2$ inefficient. Independently of the temperature, Raman scattering of incident continuum photons on the Lyman-series damping wings injects Ly$\alpha$ photons in the line core and pumps the $n=2$ state, which helps realize a partially ionized equilibrium at $5000$--$7000\,$K. Since the ratio between the incident radiation flux and gas density is limited by the dynamic effects of radiation pressure, significant ionization fraction is only realized at densities $n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, intermediate between ordinary H II regions and AGN Broad Line Regions. A large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line ratio results from such partially ionized gas as large Balmer line optical depths enhance the $n=3$ population relative to higher $n$ states. Partial ionization also provides the ideal condition for internally forming an intense and very broad Ly$\alpha$ line, which can power strong fluorescent metal emission lines observed from the Weigelt blobs of $\eta$ Carinae in the Galaxy, and from a candidate young super star cluster in the Cosmic Noon Sunburst galaxy. This phenomenon may also have implications for understanding the spectra of high-$z$ galaxies that show unusually dense ionized gas.</description>

      <title>Lens Modeling of STRIDES Strongly Lensed Quasars using Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars can be used to constrain cosmological parameters through time-delay cosmography. Models of the lens masses are a necessary component of this analysis. To enable time-delay cosmography from a sample of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ lenses, which will soon become available from surveys like the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Euclid Wide Survey, we require fast and standardizable modeling techniques. To address this need, we apply neural posterior estimation (NPE) for modeling galaxy-scale strongly lensed quasars from the Strong Lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) sample. NPE brings two advantages: speed and the ability to implicitly marginalize over nuisance parameters. We extend this method by employing sequential NPE to increase precision of mass model posteriors. We then fold individual lens models into a hierarchical Bayesian inference to recover the population distribution of lens mass parameters, accounting for out-of-distribution shift. After verifying our method using simulated analogs of the STRIDES lens sample, we apply our method to 14 Hubble Space Telescope single-filter observations. We find the population mean of the power-law elliptical mass distribution slope, $\gamma_{\text{lens}}$, to be $\mathcal{M}_{\gamma_{\text{lens}}}=2.13 \pm 0.06$. Our result represents the first population-level constraint for these systems. This population-level inference from fully automated modeling is an important stepping stone towards cosmological inference with large samples of strongly lensed quasars.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic MOND theory, promising in reproducing cosmology as well as the MOND phenomenology in the low acceleration regime, was recently proposed. We present the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and relativistic perturbation equations of this theory in cosmological context. The PN equations are presented to 1PN order and perturbation equations are presented in fully-nonlinear and exact forms. The gauge issues are clarified. The 1PN equations and linear perturbation equations are presented without imposing temporal gauge conditions. The MOND field can be interpreted as a fluid with specific equation of state without anisotropic stress, and the Jeans criterion is derived for the MOND field.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Unequal Noises and Foreground Modeling on SGWB Reconstruction with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) of cosmological origin with LISA, it is crucial to account for realistic complications in the noise and astrophysical foreground modeling that may impact the signal reconstruction. To address these challenges, we updated the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code to incorporate both variable noise levels across LISA arms and more complex foreground spectral shapes. Our findings suggest that, while moderate variations of the noise amplitudes have a minimal impact, poor foreground modeling (i.e., templates requiring many free parameters) significantly degrades the reconstruction of cosmological signals. This underlines the importance of accurate modeling and subtraction of the astrophysical foregrounds to characterize possible cosmological components. To perform this more challenging analysis, we have integrated the $\texttt{JAX}$ framework, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of the code, in the $\texttt{SGWBinner}$ code, enabling faster Bayesian likelihood sampling and more effective exploration of complex SGWB signals.</description>

Abstract: Among the great mysteries that physics has not yet solved are undoubtedly those of dark energy and dark matter. In this chapter we deal with the first of them. We will expound in detail the motivations that led to hypothesise the existence of dark energy, the importance of understanding its nature, its main possible theoretical explanations and a list of the many attempts at modelling it. We conclude with a description of the most recent and future missions on Earth and in space devised to shed light on this mystery.</description>

Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation relation of test masses in classical stochastic gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on pulsar timing arrays has provided preliminary evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational background, which, either being primordial or of astrophysical origin, will interact universally with matter distributions in our universe and affect their evolutions. This work, based on general relativity and stochastic dynamics theory, investigates the fluctuation-dissipation relation of isolated celestial bodies within a classical stochastic gravitational wave background. We employ the generalized Langevin model to analyze the fluctuating forces exerted on test masses by random spacetime and how energy dissipation occurs. Through the assumption of equilibrium, we derive the necessary conditions that should be satisfied by the stochastic gravitational wave background in the long wavelength limit, which, as we found, is a result of the back-reactions of the test mass system to the stochastic field. Additionally, as the establishment of the fluctuation-dissipation relation for such a system, certain thermodynamic quantities related to the statistical properties of the stochastic gravitational wave background could be defined and the characteristic of the diffusion process of test masses is obtained.</description>

      <title>Impact of assembly bias on clustering plus weak lensing cosmological analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical models of galaxy-halo connection such as the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model have been widely used over the past decades as a means to intensively test perturbative models on quasi-linear scales. However, these models fail to reproduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal on non-linear scales, over-predicting the observed signal up to 40%. With ongoing Stage-IV galaxy surveys such as DESI and EUCLID, it is now crucial to accurately model the galaxy-halo connection up to intra-halo scales to accurately estimate theoretical uncertainties of perturbative models. This paper compares the standard HOD model to an extended HOD framework that incorporates as additional features galaxy assembly bias and local environmental dependencies on halo occupation. These models have been calibrated against the observed clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal of eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) and Emission Lines Galaxies (ELG) in the range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.1. A combined clustering-lensing cosmological analysis is then performed on the simulated galaxy samples of both standard and extended HOD frameworks to quantify the systematic budget of perturbative models. The extended HOD model offers a more comprehensive understanding of the connection between galaxies and their surroundings. In particular, we found that the LRGs preferentially occupy denser and more anisotropic environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering environmental factors in galaxy formation models, with an extended HOD framework that reproduces the observed signal within 20% on scales below 10 Mpc/h. Our cosmological analysis reveals that our perturbative model yields similar constraints regardless of the galaxy population, with a better goodness of fit for the extended HOD. These results suggest that the extended HOD framework should be used to quantify modeling systematics.</description>

      <title>The expected kinematic matter dipole is robust against source evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background,~i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis\&amp;Baldwin in 1984 was revisited recently arguing that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis\&amp;Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the $&gt;5\sigma$ dipole anomaly uncovered recently remains an outstanding challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Impact of the galaxy cluster environment on the stretch distribution of Type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of the astrophysical environment on Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) properties is crucial to minimize systematic uncertainties in cosmological analyses based on this probe. We investigate the dependence of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch on the distance from their nearest galaxy cluster to study a potential effect of the intracluster medium (ICM) environment on SN Ia intrinsic properties. We use the largest SN Ia sample to date and cross-match it with existing X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, and optical cluster catalogs in order to study the dependence between stretch and distance to the nearest detected cluster from each SN Ia. We model the underlying stretch distribution with a Gaussian mixture with relative amplitudes that depend on redshift and cluster-centric distance. We find a significant improvement of the fit quality of the stretch distribution if we include the distance-dependant term in the model with a variation of the Akaike information criterion $\rm{\Delta AIC} = -10.2$. Because of the known correlation between galaxy age and distance from cluster center, this supports previous evidence that the age of the stellar population is the underlying driver of the bimodial shape of the SN Ia stretch distribution. We further compute the evolution of the fraction of quenched galaxies as a function of distance with respect to cluster center from our best-fit model of the SNe Ia stretch distribution and compare it to previous results obtained from $H\alpha$ line measurements, optical broadband photometry, and simulations. We find our estimate to be compatible with these results. The results of this work indicate that SNe Ia searches at high redshift targeted towards clusters to maximize detection probability should be considered with caution as the stretch distribution of the detected sample would be strongly biased towards the old sub-population of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Evolution mapping II: describing statistics of the non-linear cosmic velocity field</title>

Abstract: We extend the evolution mapping approach, originally proposed by Sanchez (2022) to describe non-linear matter density fluctuations, to statistics of the cosmic velocity field. This framework classifies cosmological parameters into shape parameters, which determine the shape of the linear matter power spectrum, $P_L(k, z)$, and evolution parameters, which control its amplitude at any given redshift. Evolution mapping leverages the fact that density fluctuations in cosmologies with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters exhibit remarkably similar non-linear evolutions when expressed as a function of the clustering amplitude. We use a suite of N-body simulations sharing identical shape parameters but spanning a wide range of evolution parameters. Using an efficient method for estimating the volume-weighted velocity field based on the Voronoi tesselation of the simulation particles, we study the non-linear evolution of the power spectra of the velocity divergence, $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$, and its cross-power spectrum with the density field, $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. By analysing snapshots at redshifts where the linear matter perturbations have the same amplitude, we demonstrate that evolution mapping accurately applies to $P_{\theta\theta}(k)$ and $P_{\delta\theta}(k)$. Deviations at small scales can be modelled in terms of differences in the suppression factor, $g(a) = D(a)/a$, akin to those observed for the density field. Evolution mapping simplifies the description of the cosmological dependence of non-linear density and velocity statistics, streamlining the sampling of large cosmological parameter spaces for the analysis of cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Weak-Lensing Shear-Selected Galaxy Clusters from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program: II. Cosmological Constraints from the Cluster Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints using the abundance of weak-lensing shear-selected galaxy clusters in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. The clusters are selected on the mass maps constructed using the three-year (Y3) weak-lensing data with an area of $\approx500~$deg$^2$, resulting in a sample size of $129$ clusters with high signal-to-noise ratios $\nu$ of $\nu\geq4.7$. Owing to the deep, wide-field, and uniform imaging of the HSC survey, this is by far the largest sample of shear-selected clusters, in which the selection solely depends on gravity and is free from any assumptions about the dynamical state. Informed by the optical counterparts, the shear-selected clusters span a redshift range of $z\lesssim0.7$ with a median of $z\approx0.3$. The lensing sources are securely selected at $z\gtrsim0.7$ with a median of $z\approx1.3$, leading to nearly zero cluster member contamination. We carefully account for (1) the bias in the photometric redshift of sources, (2) the bias and scatter in the weak-lensing mass using a simulation-based calibration, and (3) the measurement uncertainty that is directly estimated on the mass maps using an injection-based method developed in a companion paper (Chen et al. submitted). In a blind analysis, the fully marginalized posteriors of the cosmological parameters are obtained as $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}} = 0.50^{+0.28}_{-0.24}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.685^{+0.161}_{-0.088}$, $\hat{S}_{8}\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3\right)^{0.25} = 0.835^{+0.041}_{-0.044}$, and $\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3\right)^{0.5} = 0.993^{+0.084}_{-0.126}$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We compare our cosmological constraints with other studies, including those based on cluster abundances, galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering, and Cosmic Microwave Background observed by $Planck$, and find good agreement at levels of $\lesssim2\sigma$.

Abstract: Observations of the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation are described to remarkable accuracy by the six-parameterLambda CDM cosmology. However, the key ingredients of this model, namely dark matter, dark energy and cosmic inflation are not understood at a fundamental level. It is therefore important to investigate tensions between the CMB and other cosmological probes. I will review aspects of tensions with direct measurements of the Hubble constant H_0, measurements of weak gravitational lensing, and the recent hints of evolving dark energy reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration.</description>

      <title>Secondary halo bias through cosmic time II: Reconstructing halo properties using clustering information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When constructing galaxy mock catalogs based on suits of dark matter halo catalogs generated with approximated, calibrated or machine-learning approaches, the assignment of intrinsic properties for such tracers is a step of paramount relevance, given that these can shape the abundance of mock galaxy cluster and the spatial distribution of mock galaxies. We explore the possibility to assign properties of dark matter halos within the context of calibrated/learning approaches, explicitly using clustering information. The goal is to retrieve the correct signal of primary and secondary large-effective bias as a function of properties reconstructed solely based on phase-space properties of the halo distribution and dark matter density field. The algorithm reconstructs a set halo properties (such as virial mass, maximum circular velocity, concentration and spin) constraint to reproduce both primary and secondary (or assembly) bias. The key ingredients of the algorithm are the implementation of individually-assigned large-scale effective bias, a multi-scale approach to account for halo exclusion and a hierarchical assignment of halo properties. The method facilitates the assignment of halo properties aiming at replicating the large-scale effective bias, both primary and secondary. This improves over over previous methods found in the literature, especially at the high mass population. We have designed an strategy to reconstruct the main properties of dark matter halos obtained by calibrated/learning algorithms, in a way that the expected one and two-point statistics (on large scales) replicates the signal from detailed N-body simulations. We encourage the application of this strategy (or the implementation of our algorithm) for the generation of mock catalogs of dark matter halos based on approximated methods.</description>

      <title>Axions in Andromeda: Searching for Minicluster -- Neutron Star Encounters with the Green Bank Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for galactic dark matter. Theoretically, axions can convert into photons in the presence of a strong external magnetic field, which means it is possible to search for them experimentally. One approach is to use radio telescopes with high-resolution spectrometers to look for axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of neutron stars. In this paper, we describe the results obtained using a novel approach where we used the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients produced by collisions between neutron stars and dark matter clumps known as axion miniclusters. We used the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz) to observe the core of Andromeda. Our measurements are sensitive to axions with masses between 33 and 42 $\mu$eV with $\Delta$$m_a$ = 3.8$\times10^{-4}$ $\mu$eV. This paper gives a description of the search method we developed, including observation and analysis strategies. Given our analysis algorithm choices and the instrument sensitivity ($\sim$2 mJy in each spectral channel), we did not find any candidate signals greater than 5$\sigma$. We are currently implementing this search method in other spectral bands.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraint on the $f(R)$ Theory with the CSST SN Ia and BAO Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $f(R)$ modified gravity theory can explain the accelerating expansion of the late Universe without introducing dark energy. In this study, we predict the constraint strength on the $f(R)$ theory using the mock data generated from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) survey and wide-field slitless spectroscopic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) survey. We explore three popular $f(R)$ models, and introduce a parameter $b$ to characterize the deviation of the f(R) theory from the $\Lambda$CDM theory. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the parameters in the $f(R)$ models, and the nuisance parameters and systematical uncertainties are also considered in the model fitting process. Besides, we also perform model comparisons between the $f(R)$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the constraint accuracy using the CSST SN Ia+BAO dataset alone is comparable to or even better than the result given by the combination of the current relevant observations, and the CSST SN Ia+BAO survey can distinguish the $f(R)$ models from the $\Lambda$CDM model. This indicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and test the $f(R)$ theory.</description>

      <title>Consistency tests between SDSS and DESI BAO measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from redshift surveys, like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are consistent with each other. We do so by obtaining the Hubble and deceleration parameter, respectively $H(z)$ and $q(z)$, from both datasets using a non-parametric reconstruction, so that our results do not depend on any $\textit{a priori}$ assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. We find that the reconstructed $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ from SDSS are significantly inconsistent with those obtained from DESI, and that both are only marginally consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($\sim 3\sigma$ confidence level). Interestingly, the combined SDSS and DESI dataset reconciles with the standard model. These results are mostly unchanged with respect to different assumptions on the sound horizon scale value, as well as different reconstruction kernels. We also verify the results for the null diagnostic $\mathcal{O}_{\rm m}(z)$, finding that SDSS favours a quintessence-like dark energy model, whereas a phantom-like dark energy is preferred by DESI data, and once again the combined dataset strongly agrees with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore, our results call the attention for further examination of such inconsistency, as they can lead to biased and divergent results regarding the validity of the standard model, or the suggestion of new physics.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum (AM) of dark matter haloes arises from the tidal torque suffered by ellipsoidal protohaloes due to their surrounding mass distribution. Unfortunately, the practical implementation of the TTT in the peak model of structure formation, where protohaloes are, indeed, ellipsoidal patches around triaxial peaks (maxima) in the Gaussian-smoothed density field, faces some fundamental issues. First, the mass and collapse time of patches marked by Gaussian peaks are poorly determined. Second, the growth of the resulting AM is only known in linear regime. This Paper is the first of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the rotational halo properties it predicts. Here we use the CUSP formalism fixing the above mentioned indeterminacy in the protohalo AM. The peak viewpoint is fully accomplished in the sense that not only is the protohalo identified to a peak, but also the mass fluctuations causing the tidal torque are identified to peaks or holes (local minima). This way we obtain a very simple analytic expression for the mean (and median) Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of SNIa and BAO cosmic probes results using a two-regions model of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article revisists the interpretation of cosmic probes like Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) under a two-regions model of the universe. Conventional analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations predominantly capture dynamics in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about the universe's expansion. We enhance an existing two-regions model, incorporating both overdense and underdense areas, to better interpret SNIa and BAO measurements. By applying this framework, we demonstrate that the apparent accelerated expansion, typically attributed to dark energy, mary arise from observational bias rather than an intrinsic cosmological constant. The findings suggest that the observed dynamics could be an artefact of the localized evolution of overdense regions, challenging the need for dark energy as an explanatory force. This work aims to provide an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration and contribute to the ongoing debate about the true nature of the universe's expansion.</description>

      <title>Evidence for relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in Planck CMB maps with an average electron-gas temperature of $T_{\rm e}\simeq 5$ keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacking the public Planck CMB temperature maps (NILC, SMICA, SEVEM, Commander) on galaxy clusters from Planck catalogues reveals substantial residual contamination from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) emission. Unexpectedly, stacking "tSZ-free" CMB maps, like the Planck SMICA-noSZ or Constrained ILC (CILC) maps, still shows noticeable residual contamination from galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that this persisting residual stems from neglected relativistic SZ (rSZ) corrections in the CMB map estimation. Employing the component separation method outlined in Remazeilles &amp; Chluba (2020) on Planck data, we map the rSZ first-order moment field $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$ over the sky for different pivot temperatures $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ ranging from $2$ to $10$ keV. Stacking these $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-maps on Planck clusters exhibits either an intensity decrement or increment at the centre, contingent upon whether $\bar{T}_{\rm e}$ is above or below the ensemble-averaged cluster temperature $T_{\rm e}$. For the pivot value $\bar{T}_{\rm e}=5$ keV, a vanishing intensity is observed in the stacked Planck $y(T_{\rm e}-\bar{T}_{\rm e})$-map, enabling us to infer the average gas temperature of $T_{\rm e}\simeq 5$ keV for Planck clusters. Building upon this finding, we revisit the Planck tSZ-free CMB map by deprojecting the complete rSZ emission using CILC, assuming an rSZ spectrum with $T_{\rm e} = 5$ keV. Our new, rSZ-free Planck CMB map, when stacked on clusters, shows a clear cancellation of residual SZ contamination in contrast to prior (non-relativistic) tSZ-free Planck CMB maps. Our map-based approach provides compelling evidence for an average temperature of the Planck galaxy clusters of $T_{\rm e} = 4.9 \pm 2.6$ keV using the rSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Gravitational Vector Modes and their Magnetogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the presence of primordial gravitational vector modes (V-modes) and their sourcing of primordial magnetic fields (PMF), i.e. magnetogenesis. As the adiabatic vector mode generically decays with expansion, we consider exotic initial conditions which circumvent this issue and lead to observational imprints. The first initial condition is an isocurvature mode between photons and neutrinos vorticities, and the second one is a non-trivial initial condition on the neutrino octupole. Both types of conditions sustain a constant vector mode on super Hubble scales at early times. We also consider a third scenario in which the adiabatic vector modes are rapidly sourced, at a given early but finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol. We find that none of the proposed initial conditions can produce large enough PMFs to seed every type of magnetic fields observed. However, V-modes are still consistent with the data and ought to be constrained for a better understanding of the primordial Universe before its hot big-bang phase.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-$C_\ell$s for spin-$s$ fields with component-wise weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach for power spectrum estimation to the case of spin-$s$ fields weighted by a general positive-definite weight matrix that couples the different spin components of the field (e.g. $Q$ and $U$ maps in CMB polarisation analyses, or $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ shear components in weak lensing). Relevant use cases are, for example, data with significantly anisotropic noise properties, or situations in which different masks must be applied to the different field components. The weight matrix map is separated into a spin-0 part, which corresponds to the "mask" in the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, and a spin-$2s$ part sourced solely by the anisotropic elements of the matrix, leading to additional coupling between angular scales and $E/B$ modes. The general expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients involving the power spectra of these anisotropic weight components are derived and validated. The generalised algorithm is as computationally efficient as the standard approach. We implement the method in the public code NaMaster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.14115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to the TAP equation, a phenomenological implementation of the Theory of the Adjacent Possible. Several implementations of TAP are studied, with potential applications in a range of topics including economics, social sciences, environmental change, evolutionary biological systems, and the nature of physical laws. The generic behaviour is an extended plateau followed by a sharp explosive divergence. We find accurate analytic approximations for the blow-up time that we validate against numerical simulations, and explore the properties of the equation in the vicinity of equilibrium between innovation and extinction. A particular variant, the two-scale TAP model, replaces the initial plateau with a phase of exponential growth, a widening of the TAP equation phenomenology that may enable it to be applied in a wider range of contexts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Early Galaxy Formation in JWST from Axion Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that enhanced early galaxy formation can generically arise in axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter (DM) models with a delayed onset of axion field oscillation. In these models, the formation of localized massive objects enhances structure formation, potentially addressing the excess recently observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), while remaining consistent with existing constraints. We identify viable parameter space with the ALP mass in the range of $10^{-22}~{\rm eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-19}~\rm eV$. In addition, we show that the ALP parameter regions of interest can lead to intriguing complementary signatures in the small-scale structure of DM halos and existing experimental searches for ALPs.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints and Cosmographic Analysis of $f({T},{T}_{{G}})$ Gravity and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform observational confrontation and cosmographic analysis of $f(T,T_G)$ gravity and cosmology. This higher-order torsional gravity is based on both the torsion scalar, as well as on the teleparallel equivalent of the Gauss--Bonnet combination, and gives rise to an effective dark-energy sector which depends on the extra torsion contributions. We employ observational data from the Hubble function and supernova Type Ia Pantheon datasets, applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we provide the iso-likelihood contours, as well as the best-fit values for the parameters of the power-law model, an ansatz which is expected to be a good approximation of most realistic deviations from general relativity. Additionally, we reconstruct the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, which exhibits a quintessence-like behavior, while in the future the Universe enters into the phantom regime, before it tends asymptotically to the cosmological constant value. Furthermore, we perform a detailed cosmographic analysis, examining the deceleration, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters, showing that the transition to acceleration occurs in the redshift range $ 0.52 \leq z_{tr} \leq 0.89 $, as well as the preference of the scenario for quintessence-like behavior. Finally, we apply the Om</description>

      <title>Investigating cosmic histories with a stiff era through Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of gravitational-wave background searches to constrain cosmic histories characterised by a stiff equation of state, preceded by a period of matter domination. Such a scenario leads to a characteristic peak in the primordial gravitational-wave spectrum originating from cosmological inflation. Assuming instant transitions between distinct epochs, which allows an analytical treatment of the gravitational-wave spectrum, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis to derive constraints from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Additionally, we consider a smooth transition, employing an axion-like particle physics model, and highlight the difference with the instant transition approximation. We then forecast detection prospects for such a cosmic history through future gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Image formation near hyperbolic umbilic in strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic umbilic (HU) is a point singularity of the gravitational lens equation, giving rise to a ring-shaped image formation made of four highly magnified images, off-centred from the lens centre. Recent observations have revealed new strongly lensed image formations near HU singularities, and many more are expected in ongoing and future observations. Like fold/cusp, image formations near HU also satisfy magnification relation ($R_{\rm hu}$), i.e., the signed magnification sum of the four images equals zero. Here, we study how $R_{\rm hu}$ deviates from zero as a function of area ($A_{\rm hu}$) covered by the image formation near HU and the distance ($d$) of the central maxima image (which is part of the HU image formation) from the lens centre for ideal single- and double-component cluster-scale lenses. For lens ellipticity values $\geq0.3$, the central maxima image will form sufficiently far from the lens centre ($d\gtrsim5''$), similar to the observed HU image formations with $R_{\rm hu}\simeq0$. We also find that, in some cases, double-component and actual cluster-scale lenses can lead to large cross-sections for HU image formations for sources at $z\gtrsim5$, effectively increasing the chances to observe HU image formation at high redshifts. Finally, we study the time delay distribution in the observed HU image formations, finding that not only are these images highly magnified, but the relative time delay between various pairs of HU characteristic image formation has a typical value of $\sim100$ days, an order of magnitude smaller than generic five-image formations in cluster lenses, making such image formations optimal targets for time delay cosmography studies.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the influence of graviton fluctuations on the inflationary spectrum with a Kucha\v{r}-Torre clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the search for a coherent and consistent formulation to describe quantum gravity corrections to Quantum Field Theory. We implement two fundamental ingredients discussed in previous analyses: on one hand, the construction of the Wentzel-Kramer-Brillouin and Born-Oppenheimer picture for the Wheeler-DeWitt theory of gravity and matter by using a reference fluid as physical clock; on the other hand, we explicitly separate in the metric field its own purely classical contribution from the quantum graviton degrees of freedom. This allows to derive, by the expansion in a Planckian parameter, a unitary theory properly evaluating the Quantum Field Theory modifications in the considered regime. More specifically, we recover at zero order the standard theory on curved space-time after averaging over the graviton sector. The physical corrections are induced at first order by (quantum) gravitons, thought as the slow-varying component of the system, as opposed to the fast quantum matter and reference fluid. The genuine contribution due to gravitons, non-factorizable into an independent phase, provides a coherent quantum gravity modification on Quantum Field Theory. We show this by determining the predicted inflationary spectrum during an exact de Sitter phase of the primordial Universe, finding a breaking of the scale invariant morphology even when the inflation potential is modelled by a cosmological constant term. Remarkably, the behavior of such non-scale-invariant spectrum overlaps predictions previously obtained in literature by neglecting non-unitary terms emerging in those formulations. In this respect, the present model provides a satisfactory regularization of such approaches, by virtue of a more realistic construction of the physical clock for the total (gravity + matter) quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Multicomponent Dark Energy Model and the Possibility of Early Dark Energy Like Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics and phase-space behavior of a multicomponent dark energy model, where the dark sector consists of a minimally coupled canonical scalar field and the cosmological constant, using a dynamical system analysis setup for various types of potentials for which a general parameterisation of the scalar field potentials has been considered. Several fixed points with different cosmological behaviours have been identified. A detailed stability analysis has been done and possible late-time attractors have been found. For this multi-component dark energy model, the late-time attractors are either fully dominated by the cosmological constant or represent a scenario where a combination of the scalar field and the cosmological constant dominates the universe. We have also shown that for this type of model, the scalar field can show early dark energy (EDE) like behaviour. However, our analysis indicates that this EDE like behaviour occurs naturally deep in the matter-dominated era, not before the recombination era.</description>

      <title>The light burden of memory: constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>
