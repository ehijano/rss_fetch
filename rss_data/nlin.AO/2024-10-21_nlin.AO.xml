      <title>Oscillatory equilibrium in asymmetric evolutionary games: Generalizing evolutionarily stable strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of evolutionarily stability and its relation with the fixed points of the replicator equation are important aspects of evolutionary game dynamics. In the light of the fact that oscillating state of a population and individuals (or players) of different roles are quite natural occurrences, we ask the question how the concept of evolutionarily stability can be generalized so as to associate game-theoretic meaning to oscillatory behaviours of players asymmetrically interacting, i.e., if there are both intraspecific and interspecific interactions between two subpopulations in the population. We guide our scheme of generalization such that the evolutionary stability is related to the dynamic stability of the corresponding periodic orbits of a time-discrete replicator dynamics. We name the generalization of evolutionarily stable state as two-species heterogeneity stable orbit. Furthermore, we invoke the principle of decrease of relative entropy in order to associate the generalization of evolutionary stability with an information-theoretic meaning. This particular generalization is aptly termed as two-species information stable orbit.</description>

      <title>Multistable Synaptic Plasticity induces Memory Effects and Cohabitation of Chimera and Bump States in Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states and bump states are collective synchronization phenomena observed independently (at different parameter regions) in networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. And while chimera states are characterized by coexistence of coherent and incoherent domains, bump states consist of active domains operating on a silent background. Multistable plasticity in the network connections originates from brain dynamics and is based on the idea that neural cells may transmit inhibitory or excitatory signals depending on various factors, such as local connectivity, influence of neighboring cells etc. During the system/network integration, the link weights adapt and, in the case of multistability, they may organize in coexisting excitatory and/or inhibitory domains. Here, we explore the influence of bistable plasticity on collective synchronization states and we numerically demonstrate that the dynamics of the linking may give rise to co-existence of bump-like and chimera-like states simultaneously in the network. In the case of bump and chimera co-existence, confinement effects are developed: the different domains stay localized and do not travel around the network. Memory effects are also reported in the sense that the final spatial arrangement of the coupling strengths reflects some of the local properties of the initial link distribution. For the quantification of the system's spatial and temporal features, the global and local entropy functions are employed as measures of the network organization, while the average firing rates account for the network evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Megastable quantization in generalized pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical particle in a harmonic potential gives rise to a continuous energy spectra, whereas the corresponding quantum particle exhibits countably infinite quantized energy levels. In recent years, classical non-Markovian wave-particle entities that materialize as walking droplets, have been shown to exhibit various hydrodynamic quantum analogs, including quantization in a harmonic potential via limit cycle orbits. However, the number of co-existing quantized states are limited to at most a few limit cycles. By considering a minimal generalized pilot-wave model of the system in the low-memory and low-dissipation regime, we obtain a classical harmonic oscillator perturbed by an oscillatory non-conservative force that displays a countably infinite coexisting limit-cycle states, also know as \emph{megastability}; thus forming a dynamical analog of infinite quantized states. Using averaging techniques, we derive an analytical approximation of the orbital radii, orbital frequency and Lyapunov energy function, of this megastable spectrum, and further show average energy conservation along these quantized states. Our formalism extends to a general class of self-excited oscillators and can be used to construct megastable spectrum with different energy-frequency relations.</description>
