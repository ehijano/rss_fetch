      <title>The Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model with Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forces which drive growth, development, survival and change within an ecological system involving a predator and prey specie are not easily addressed in the field. To better understand the dynamics in the system, ecologists have turned to mathematical models. The predator-prey dynamics of rat and cat population in a given ecology is studied. The mathematical model proposed by Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra called the Lotka-Volterra model for studying predator-prey dynamics is utilized. Assumptions were made to suit the given ecology. These assumptions lead to the modification of the Lotka-Volterra equations. The equilibrium and stability properties of the modified model is established. Results were simulated using MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Bayes Meets Riemann Again: Large Prime Discovery and Re-emergence of the Bone of Contention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime numbers have fascinated mathematicians since antiquity, with ongoing efforts to uncover both their properties and ever-larger examples. While giant primes rarely aid cryptography, they find use in areas such as locally decodable codes. Large prime-hunting, often brute-force in nature, is conceptually linked to the Riemann Hypothesis and the prime number theorem, which portrays prime distribution as essentially random. This motivates a statistical perspective, with Bayesian methodology providing a natural foundation.
  We show that the prime number theorem suggests a nonhomogeneous Poisson process for prime counts, yielding primes as waiting times. This process agrees with the prime number theorem, asymptotic results, and prime gap properties. Building on it, we develop a recursive Bayesian theory for large prime prediction and Riemann Hypothesis validation. The approach matches traditional but computationally infeasible non-recursive Bayesian formulations in the limit, and it strongly falsifies the Riemann Hypothesis.
  Finally, we propose a computational method using Transformation-based MCMC to simulate recursive posterior predictives. A simple change of variable enables simulation of Mersenne prime exponents. With modest computing resources, we identified 259 primes over 140 million, including 184 strong Mersenne candidates corresponding to potential primes with 42--242 million digits.</description>

      <title>On the Irreducibility of the Cuboid Polynomial $P_{a,u}(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the even monic degree-8 cuboid polynomial $P_{a,u}(t)$ with coprime integers $a\neq u&gt;0$. We prove irreducibility over $\mathbb{Z}$ by excluding all degree-8 splittings. First, any putative $4{+}4$ factorization is shown to force a specific Diophantine constraint that has no integer solutions, via a short $2$- and $3$-adic analysis. Second, we exclude every $2{+}6$ factorization using an exact divisor criterion together with a discriminant obstruction. Finally, after ruling out $2{+}6$, the patterns $2{+}2{+}4$, $2{+}2{+}2{+}2$, and $3{+}3{+}2$ regroup trivially to $2{+}6$ and are therefore impossible. Consequently, $P_{a,u}(t)$ admits no nontrivial factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$.</description>
