      <title>Geneshift: Impact of different scenario shift on Jailbreaking LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks, which aim to cause LLMs to perform unrestricted behaviors, have become a critical and challenging direction in AI safety. Despite achieving the promising attack success rate using dictionary-based evaluation, existing jailbreak attack methods fail to output detailed contents to satisfy the harmful request, leading to poor performance on GPT-based evaluation. To this end, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack termed GeneShift, by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the scenario shifts. Firstly, we observe that the malicious queries perform optimally under different scenario shifts. Based on it, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve and select the hybrid of scenario shifts. It guides our method to elicit detailed and actionable harmful responses while keeping the seemingly benign facade, improving stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GeneShift. Notably, GeneShift increases the jailbreak success rate from 0% to 60% when direct prompting alone would fail.</description>

      <title>GenXSS: an AI-Driven Framework for Automated Detection of XSS Attacks in WAFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on web services has led to a rise in cybersecurity threats, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which target client-side layers of web applications by injecting malicious scripts. Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) struggle to detect highly obfuscated and complex attacks, as their rules require manual updates. This paper presents a novel generative AI framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance XSS mitigation. The framework achieves two primary objectives: (1) generating sophisticated and syntactically validated XSS payloads using in-context learning, and (2) automating defense mechanisms by testing these attacks against a vulnerable application secured by a WAF, classifying bypassing attacks, and generating effective WAF security rules. Experimental results using GPT-4o demonstrate the framework's effectiveness generating 264 XSS payloads, 83% of which were validated, with 80% bypassing ModSecurity WAF equipped with an industry standard security rule set developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to protect against web vulnerabilities. Through rule generation, 86% of previously successful attacks were blocked using only 15 new rules. In comparison, Google Gemini Pro achieved a lower bypass rate of 63%, highlighting performance differences across LLMs.</description>

      <title>DaemonSec: Examining the Role of Machine Learning for Daemon Security in Linux Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DaemonSec is an early-stage startup exploring machine learning (ML)-based security for Linux daemons, a critical yet often overlooked attack surface. While daemon security remains underexplored, conventional defenses struggle against adaptive threats and zero-day exploits. To assess the perspectives of IT professionals on ML-driven daemon protection, a systematic interview study based on semi-structured interviews was conducted with 22 professionals from industry and academia. The study evaluates adoption, feasibility, and trust in ML-based security solutions. While participants recognized the potential of ML for real-time anomaly detection, findings reveal skepticism toward full automation, limited security awareness among non-security roles, and concerns about patching delays creating attack windows. This paper presents the methods, key findings, and implications for advancing ML-driven daemon security in industry.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Data Domain Extraction on Synthetic Data Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08254v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs), are widely used to assess the privacy of generative models for tabular synthetic data, including those with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. These attacks often exploit outliers, which are especially vulnerable due to their position at the boundaries of the data domain (e.g., at the minimum and maximum values). However, the role of data domain extraction in generative models and its impact on privacy attacks have been overlooked. In this paper, we examine three strategies for defining the data domain: assuming it is externally provided (ideally from public data), extracting it directly from the input data, and extracting it with DP mechanisms. While common in popular implementations and libraries, we show that the second approach breaks end-to-end DP guarantees and leaves models vulnerable. While using a provided domain (if representative) is preferable, extracting it with DP can also defend against popular MIAs, even at high privacy budgets.</description>

      <title>To See or Not to See -- Fingerprinting Devices in Adversarial Environments Amid Advanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of the Internet of Things raises security concerns. To address this, device fingerprinting is often employed to authenticate devices, detect adversaries, and identify eavesdroppers in an environment. This requires the ability to discern between legitimate and malicious devices which is achieved by analyzing the unique physical and/or operational characteristics of IoT devices. In the era of the latest progress in machine learning, particularly generative models, it is crucial to methodically examine the current studies in device fingerprinting. This involves explaining their approaches and underscoring their limitations when faced with adversaries armed with these ML tools. To systematically analyze existing methods, we propose a generic, yet simplified, model for device fingerprinting. Additionally, we thoroughly investigate existing methods to authenticate devices and detect eavesdropping, using our proposed model. We further study trends and similarities between works in authentication and eavesdropping detection and present the existing threats and attacks in these domains. Finally, we discuss future directions in fingerprinting based on these trends to develop more secure IoT fingerprinting schemes.</description>

      <title>Practical Secure Aggregation by Combining Cryptography and Trusted Execution Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure aggregation enables a group of mutually distrustful parties, each holding private inputs, to collaboratively compute an aggregate value while preserving the privacy of their individual inputs. However, a major challenge in adopting secure aggregation approaches for practical applications is the significant computational overhead of the underlying cryptographic protocols, e.g. fully homomorphic encryption. This overhead makes secure aggregation protocols impractical, especially for large datasets. In contrast, hardware-based security techniques such as trusted execution environments (TEEs) enable computation at near-native speeds, making them a promising alternative for reducing the computational burden typically associated with purely cryptographic techniques. Yet, in many scenarios, parties may opt for either cryptographic or hardware-based security mechanisms, highlighting the need for hybrid approaches. In this work, we introduce several secure aggregation architectures that integrate both cryptographic and TEE-based techniques, analyzing the trade-offs between security and performance.</description>

      <title>Toward Realistic Adversarial Attacks in IDS: A Novel Feasibility Metric for Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferability-based adversarial attacks exploit the ability of adversarial examples, crafted to deceive a specific source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) model, to also mislead a target IDS model without requiring access to the training data or any internal model parameters. These attacks exploit common vulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass security measures and compromise systems. Although the transferability concept has been widely studied, its practical feasibility remains limited due to assumptions of high similarity between source and target models. This paper analyzes the core factors that contribute to transferability, including feature alignment, model architectural similarity, and overlap in the data distributions that each IDS examines. We propose a novel metric, the Transferability Feasibility Score (TFS), to assess the feasibility and reliability of such attacks based on these factors. Through experimental evidence, we demonstrate that TFS and actual attack success rates are highly correlated, addressing the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world impact. Our findings provide needed guidance for designing more realistic transferable adversarial attacks, developing robust defenses, and ultimately improving the security of machine learning-based IDS in critical systems.</description>

      <title>An Early Experience with Confidential Computing Architecture for On-Device Model Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying machine learning (ML) models on user devices can improve privacy (by keeping data local) and reduce inference latency. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a practical solution for protecting proprietary models, yet existing TEE solutions have architectural constraints that hinder on-device model deployment. Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), a new Arm extension, addresses several of these limitations and shows promise as a secure platform for on-device ML. In this paper, we evaluate the performance-privacy trade-offs of deploying models within CCA, highlighting its potential to enable confidential and efficient ML applications. Our evaluations show that CCA can achieve an overhead of, at most, 22% in running models of different sizes and applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and chat assistants. This performance overhead comes with privacy benefits; for example, our framework can successfully protect the model against membership inference attack by an 8.3% reduction in the adversary's success rate. To support further research and early adoption, we make our code and methodology publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Chaos-Based Cryptographic Framework for Post-Quantum Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CryptoChaos, a novel hybrid cryptographic framework that synergizes deterministic chaos theory with cutting-edge cryptographic primitives to achieve robust, post-quantum resilient encryption. CryptoChaos harnesses the intrinsic unpredictability of four discrete chaotic maps (Logistic, Chebyshev, Tent, and Henon) to generate a high-entropy, multidimensional key from a unified entropy pool. This key is derived through a layered process that combines SHA3-256 hashing with an ephemeral X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange and is refined using an HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF). The resulting encryption key powers AES-GCM, providing both confidentiality and integrity. Comprehensive benchmarking against established symmetric ciphers confirms that CryptoChaos attains near-maximal Shannon entropy (approximately 8 bits per byte) and exhibits negligible adjacent-byte correlations, while robust performance on the NIST SP 800-22 test suite underscores its statistical rigor. Moreover, quantum simulations demonstrate that the additional complexity inherent in chaotic key generation dramatically elevates the resource requirements for Grover-based quantum attacks, with an estimated T gate count of approximately 2.1 x 10^9. The modular and interoperable design of CryptoChaos positions it as a promising candidate for high-assurance applications, ranging from secure communications and financial transactions to IoT systems, paving the way for next-generation post-quantum encryption standards.</description>

      <title>Enterprise-Grade Security for the Model Context Protocol (MCP): Frameworks and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP), introduced by Anthropic, provides a standardized framework for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to interact with external data sources and tools in real-time. While MCP offers significant advantages for AI integration and capability extension, it introduces novel security challenges that demand rigorous analysis and mitigation. This paper builds upon foundational research into MCP architecture and preliminary security assessments to deliver enterprise-grade mitigation frameworks and detailed technical implementation strategies. Through systematic threat modeling and analysis of MCP implementations and analysis of potential attack vectors, including sophisticated threats like tool poisoning, we present actionable security patterns tailored for MCP implementers and adopters. The primary contribution of this research lies in translating theoretical security concerns into a practical, implementable framework with actionable controls, thereby providing essential guidance for the secure enterprise adoption and governance of integrated AI systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Selection using Smooth Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private selection mechanisms offer strong privacy guarantees for queries aiming to identify the top-scoring element r from a finite set R, based on a dataset-dependent utility function. While selection queries are fundamental in data science, few mechanisms effectively ensure their privacy. Furthermore, most approaches rely on global sensitivity to achieve differential privacy (DP), which can introduce excessive noise and impair downstream inferences. To address this limitation, we propose the Smooth Noisy Max (SNM) mechanism, which leverages smooth sensitivity to yield provably tighter (upper bounds on) expected errors compared to global sensitivity-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate that SNM is more accurate than state-of-the-art differentially private selection methods in three applications: percentile selection, greedy decision trees, and random forests.</description>

      <title>Detecting Credit Card Fraud via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Graph Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a credit card fraud detection method based on Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) to address fraud in complex transaction networks. Unlike traditional machine learning methods that rely solely on numerical features of transaction records, this approach constructs heterogeneous transaction graphs. These graphs incorporate multiple node types, including users, merchants, and transactions. By leveraging graph neural networks, the model captures higher-order transaction relationships. A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning. These techniques strengthen the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing GNN models, including GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE, on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. The model achieves notable improvements in both accuracy and OC-ROC. Future research may explore the integration of dynamic graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. Such advancements could enhance the real-time adaptability of fraud detection systems and provide more intelligent solutions for financial risk control.</description>

      <title>SAEs $\textit{Can}$ Improve Unlearning: Dynamic Sparse Autoencoder Guardrails for Precision Unlearning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is a promising approach to improve LLM safety by removing unwanted knowledge from the model. However, prevailing gradient-based unlearning methods suffer from issues such as high computational costs, hyperparameter instability, poor sequential unlearning capability, vulnerability to relearning attacks, low data efficiency, and lack of interpretability. While Sparse Autoencoders are well-suited to improve these aspects by enabling targeted activation-based unlearning, prior approaches underperform gradient-based methods. This work demonstrates that, contrary to these earlier findings, SAEs can significantly improve unlearning when employed dynamically. We introduce $\textbf{Dynamic DAE Guardrails}$ (DSG), a novel method for precision unlearning that leverages principled feature selection and a dynamic classifier. Our experiments show DSG substantially outperforms leading unlearning methods, achieving superior forget-utility trade-offs. DSG addresses key drawbacks of gradient-based approaches for unlearning -- offering enhanced computational efficiency and stability, robust performance in sequential unlearning, stronger resistance to relearning attacks, better data efficiency including zero-shot settings, and more interpretable unlearning.</description>

      <title>The More is not the Merrier: Investigating the Effect of Client Size on Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced as a way to keep data local to clients while training a shared machine learning model, as clients train on their local data and send trained models to a central aggregator. It is expected that FL will have a huge implication on Mobile Edge Computing, the Internet of Things, and Cross-Silo FL. In this paper, we focus on the widely used FedAvg algorithm to explore the effect of the number of clients in FL. We find a significant deterioration of learning accuracy for FedAvg as the number of clients increases. To address this issue for a general application, we propose a method called Knowledgeable Client Insertion (KCI) that introduces a very small number of knowledgeable clients to the MEC setting. These knowledgeable clients are expected to have accumulated a large set of data samples to help with training. With the help of KCI, the learning accuracy of FL increases much faster even with a normal FedAvg aggregation technique. We expect this approach to be able to provide great privacy protection for clients against security attacks such as model inversion attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Eleanor-W/KCI_for_FL.</description>

      <title>EO-VLM: VLM-Guided Energy Overload Attacks on Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision models are increasingly deployed in critical applications such as autonomous driving and CCTV monitoring, yet they remain susceptible to resource-consuming attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy-overloading attack that leverages vision language model (VLM) prompts to generate adversarial images targeting vision models. These images, though imperceptible to the human eye, significantly increase GPU energy consumption across various vision models, threatening the availability of these systems. Our framework, EO-VLM (Energy Overload via VLM), is model-agnostic, meaning it is not limited by the architecture or type of the target vision model. By exploiting the lack of safety filters in VLMs like DALL-E 3, we create adversarial noise images without requiring prior knowledge or internal structure of the target vision models. Our experiments demonstrate up to a 50% increase in energy consumption, revealing a critical vulnerability in current vision models.</description>

      <title>The Inadequacy of Similarity-based Privacy Metrics: Privacy Attacks against "Truly Anonymous" Synthetic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data.
  In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.</description>

      <title>You Can't Trust Your Tag Neither: Privacy Leaks and Potential Legal Violations within the Google Tag Manager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08806v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tag Management Systems were developed in order to support website publishers in installing multiple third-party JavaScript scripts (Tags) on their websites. Google developed its own TMS called ``Google Tag Manager'' (GTM) that is currently present on 42\% of the top 1 million most popular websites. However, GTM has not yet been thoroughly evaluated by the academic research community. In this work, we study, for the first time, the Tags provided within the GTM system. We propose a new methodology called ``detecting privacy leaks in isolation'' and apply it to multiple Tags to analyse the types of data that Tags collect and contrast them to the legal and technical documentation, in collaboration with a legal expert. Across three studies - in-depth analysis of 6 Tags, automated analysis of 718 Tags, and analysis of Google ``Consent Mode'' - we discover multiple hidden data leaks, incomplete and diverging declarations, undisclosed third-parties and cookies, personal data sharing without consent and we further identify potential legal violations within EU Data Protection law.</description>

      <title>On Kernel's Safety in the Spectre Era (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficacy of address space layout randomization has been formally demonstrated in a shared-memory model by Abadi et al., contingent on specific assumptions about victim programs. However, modern operating systems, implementing layout randomization in the kernel, diverge from these assumptions and operate on a separate memory model with communication through system calls. In this work, we relax Abadi et al.'s language assumptions while demonstrating that layout randomization offers a comparable safety guarantee in a system with memory separation. However, in practice, speculative execution and side-channels are recognized threats to layout randomization. We show that kernel safety cannot be restored for attackers capable of using side-channels and speculative execution and introduce a new condition, that allows us to formally prove kernel safety in the Spectre era. Our research demonstrates that under this condition, the system remains safe without relying on layout randomization. We also demonstrate that our condition can be sensibly weakened, leading to enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee kernel safety for safe system calls in the Spectre era.</description>

      <title>Decoding Android Malware with a Fraction of Features: An Attention-Enhanced MLP-SVM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating sophistication of Android malware poses significant challenges to traditional detection methods, necessitating innovative approaches that can efficiently identify and classify threats with high precision. This paper introduces a novel framework that synergistically integrates an attention-enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make Android malware detection and classification more effective. By carefully analyzing a mere 47 features out of over 9,760 available in the comprehensive CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, our MLP-SVM model achieves an impressive accuracy over 99% in identifying malicious applications. The MLP, enhanced with an attention mechanism, focuses on the most discriminative features and further reduces the 47 features to only 14 components using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Despite this significant reduction in dimensionality, the SVM component, equipped with an RBF kernel, excels in mapping these components to a high-dimensional space, facilitating precise classification of malware into their respective families. Rigorous evaluations, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, confirm the superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed framework not only significantly reduces the computational complexity by leveraging a compact feature set but also exhibits resilience against the evolving Android malware landscape.</description>

      <title>AIArena: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized AI Training Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DPImageBench: A Unified Benchmark for Differentially Private Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) image synthesis aims to generate artificial images that retain the properties of sensitive images while protecting the privacy of individual images within the dataset. Despite recent advancements, we find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been applied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current methods but also hinders future advancements.
  To address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image synthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We study eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on model architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2) Evaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to thoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting downstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set not only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench corrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation protocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates current and future implementations within a unified framework. With DPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the common wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial, we find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive images significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does not always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional features, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less affected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional features, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the latter under a low privacy budget.</description>

      <title>CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications. This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>MCP Safety Audit: LLMs with the Model Context Protocol Allow Major Security Exploits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between potential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and subsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources, and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs. However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.

      <title>Decomposition-Based Optimal Bounds for Privacy Amplification via Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shuffling has been shown to amplify differential privacy guarantees, offering a stronger privacy-utility trade-off. To characterize and compute this amplification, two fundamental analytical frameworks have been proposed: the privacy blanket by Balle et al. (CRYPTO 2019) and the clone paradigm (including both the standard clone and stronger clone) by Feldman et al. (FOCS 2021, SODA 2023). All these methods rely on decomposing local randomizers.
  In this work, we introduce a unified analysis framework--the general clone paradigm--which encompasses all possible decompositions. We identify the optimal decomposition within the general clone paradigm. Moreover, we develop a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the exact value of the optimal privacy amplification bounds via Fast Fourier Transform. Experimental results demonstrate that the computed upper bounds for privacy amplification closely approximate the lower bounds, highlighting the tightness of our approach. Finally, using our algorithm, we conduct the first systematic analysis of the joint composition of LDP protocols in the shuffle model.</description>

      <title>Malware analysis assisted by AI with R2AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research studies the quality, speed and cost of malware analysis assisted by artificial intelligence. It focuses on Linux and IoT malware of 2024-2025, and uses r2ai, the AI extension of Radare2's disassembler. Not all malware and not all LLMs are equivalent but the study shows excellent results with Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet. Despite a few errors, the quality of analysis is overall equal or better than without AI assistance. For good results, the AI cannot operate alone and must constantly be guided by an experienced analyst. The gain of speed is largely visible with AI assistance, even when taking account the time to understand AI's hallucinations, exaggerations and omissions. The cost is usually noticeably lower than the salary of a malware analyst, but attention and guidance is needed to keep it under control in cases where the AI would naturally loop without showing progress.</description>

      <title>The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy of Risks From Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &amp; toxicity, (2) Privacy &amp; security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &amp; misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic &amp; environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, &amp; limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separation Between Quantum Commitments and Quantum One-wayness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exists an oracle relative to which quantum commitments exist but no (efficiently verifiable) one-way state generators exist. Both have been widely considered candidates for replacing one-way functions as the minimal assumption for cryptography: the weakest cryptographic assumption implied by all of computational cryptography. Recent work has shown that commitments can be constructed from one-way state generators, but the other direction has remained open. Our results rule out any black-box construction, and thus settles this crucial open problem, suggesting that quantum commitments (as well as its equivalency class of EFI pairs, quantum oblivious transfer, and secure quantum multiparty computation) appear to be strictly weakest among all known cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>Auditing Differential Privacy in the Black-Box Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for auditing differential privacy (DP) in a black-box setting. Leveraging the concept of $f$-differential privacy, we explicitly define type I and type II errors and propose an auditing mechanism based on conformal inference. Our approach robustly controls the type I error rate under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a fundamental impossibility result, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of simultaneously controlling both type I and type II errors without additional assumptions. Nevertheless, under a monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) assumption, our auditing mechanism effectively controls both errors. We also extend our method to construct valid confidence bands for the trade-off function in the finite-sample regime.</description>

      <title>Nanopass Back-Translation of Call-Return Trees for Mechanized Secure Compilation Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers aim to build secure compilation chains enforcing that if there is no attack a source context can mount against a source program then there is also no attack an adversarial target context can mount against the compiled program. Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however, challenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a target context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source context mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a novel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be more easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace prefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target context and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we back-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use state in the generated source context to record the current location in the call-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each adding to the tree new information describing how the location should change depending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation correct we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language, using ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution invariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the back-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular structure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its correctness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.</description>
