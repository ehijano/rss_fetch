      <title>Corrected Riemann smoothed particle hydrodynamics method for multi-resolution fluid-structure interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a mesh-free method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been widely used for modeling and simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. While the kernel gradient correction (KGC) method is commonly applied in structural domains to enhance numerical consistency, high-order consistency corrections that preserve conservation remain underutilized in fluid domains despite their critical role in FSI analysis, especially for the multi-resolution scheme where fluid domains generally have a low resolution. In this study, we incorporate the reverse kernel gradient correction (RKGC) formulation, a conservative high-order consistency approximation, into the fluid discretization for solving FSI problems. RKGC has been proven to achieve exact second-order convergence with relaxed particles and improve numerical accuracy while particularly enhancing energy conservation in free-surface flow simulations. By integrating this correction into the Riemann SPH method to solve different typical FSI problems with a multi-resolution scheme, numerical results consistently show improvements in accuracy and convergence compared to uncorrected fluid discretization. Despite these advances, further refinement of correction techniques for solid domains and fluid-structure interfaces remains significant for enhancing the overall accuracy of SPH-based FSI modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of an Extreme-Scale, High-Performance, and Modular Agent-Based Simulation Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling is indispensable for studying complex systems across many domains. However, existing simulation platforms exhibit two major issues: performance and modularity. Low performance prevents simulations with a large number of agents, increases development time, limits parameter exploration, and raises computing costs. Inflexible software designs motivate modelers to create their own tools, diverting valuable resources.
  This dissertation introduces a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo and its significant improvement, TeraAgent, to alleviate these challenges via three major works.
  First, we lay the platform's foundation by defining abstractions, establishing software infrastructure, and implementing a multitude of features for agent-based modeling. We demonstrate BioDynaMo's modularity through use cases in neuroscience, epidemiology, and oncology. We validate these models and show the simplicity of adding new functionality with few lines of code.
  Second, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and identify challenges for shared-memory parallelism. Provided solutions include an optimized grid for neighbor searching, mechanisms to reduce the memory access latency, and exploiting domain knowledge to omit unnecessary work. These improvements yield up to three orders of magnitude speedups, enabling simulations of 1.7 billion agents on a single server.
  Third, we present TeraAgent, a distributed simulation engine that allows scaling out the computation of one simulation to multiple servers. We identify and address server communication bottlenecks and implement solutions for serialization and delta encoding to accelerate and reduce data transfer. TeraAgent can simulate 500 billion agents and scales to 84096 CPU cores.
  BioDynaMo has been widely adopted, including a prize-winning radiotherapy simulation recognized as a top 10 breakthrough in physics in 2024.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stock Movement with BERTweet and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying deep learning and computational intelligence to finance has been a popular area of applied research, both within academia and industry, and continues to attract active attention. The inherently high volatility and non-stationary of the data pose substantial challenges to machine learning models, especially so for today's expressive and highly-parameterized deep learning models. Recent work has combined natural language processing on data from social media to augment models based purely on historic price data to improve performance has received particular attention. Previous work has achieved state-of-the-art performance on this task by combining techniques such as bidirectional GRUs, variational autoencoders, word and document embeddings, self-attention, graph attention, and adversarial training. In this paper, we demonstrated the efficacy of BERTweet, a variant of BERT pre-trained specifically on a Twitter corpus, and the transformer architecture by achieving competitive performance with the existing literature and setting a new baseline for Matthews Correlation Coefficient on the Stocknet dataset without auxiliary data sources.</description>

      <title>Unfitted hybrid high-order methods stabilized by polynomial extension for elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the design and the analysis of a novel hybrid high-order (HHO) method on unfitted meshes. HHO methods rely on a pair of unknowns, combining polynomials attached to the mesh faces and the mesh cells. In the unfitted framework, the interface can cut through the mesh cells in a very general fashion, and the polynomial unknowns are doubled in the cut cells and the cut faces. In order to avoid the ill-conditioning issues caused by the presence of small cut cells, the novel approach introduced herein is to use polynomial extensions in the definition of the gradient reconstruction operator. Stability and consistency results are established, leading to optimally decaying error estimates. The theory is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search in Scopus within "Article title, Abstract, Keywords" unveils 2,444 documents focused on the biomechanics of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA), mostly on AAA wall stress. Only 24 documents investigated AAA kinematics, an important topic that could potentially offer significant insights into the biomechanics of AAA. In this paper, we present an image-based approach for patient-specific, in vivo, and non-invasive AAA kinematic analysis using patient's time-resolved 3D computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) images, with an objective to measure wall displacement and strain during the cardiac cycle. Our approach relies on regularized deformable image registration for estimating wall displacement, estimation of the local wall strain as the ratio of its normal displacement to its local radius of curvature, and local surface fitting with non-deterministic outlier detection for estimating the wall radius of curvature. We verified our approach against synthetic ground truth image data created by warping a 3D-CTA image of AAA using a realistic displacement field obtained from a finite element biomechanical model. We applied our approach to assess AAA wall displacements and strains in ten patients. Our kinematic analysis results indicated that the 99th percentile of circumferential wall strain, among all patients, ranged from 2.62% to 5.54%, with an average of 4.45% and a standard deviation of 0.87%. We also observed that AAA wall strains are significantly lower than those of a healthy aorta. Our work demonstrates that the registration-based measurement of AAA wall displacements in the direction normal to the wall is sufficiently accurate to reliably estimate strain from these displacements.</description>

      <title>Abdominal aortic aneurysm wall stress: A 7-line code in MATLAB and a one-click software application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition characterized by the irreversible dilation of the lower aorta, usually detected incidentally during imaging for other health issues. Current clinical practice for managing AAA relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, based on the aneurysm's maximum diameter and growth rate, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of AAA rupture risk. Patient-specific AAA wall stress, computed using biomechanical models derived from medical images without needing patient-specific material properties, has been widely investigated for developing individualized AAA rupture risk predictors. Therefore, AAA wall stress, determined reliably and quickly, has the potential to enhance patient-specific treatment plans. This paper presents a 7-line code, written in MATLAB using the Partial Differential Equation Toolbox, for AAA wall stress computations via finite element analysis. The code takes AAA wall geometry as input and outputs stress components over the AAA wall domain. Additionally, we present a one-click standalone software application for AAA wall stress computation, developed based on our 7-line code using MATLAB Compiler. After verification, we used our code to compute AAA wall stress in ten patients. Our analysis indicated that the 99th percentile of maximum principal stress across all patients ranged from 0.307 MPa to 0.466 MPa, with an average of 0.380 MPa and a standard deviation of 0.048 MPa. Moreover, for every case, the MATLAB simulation time was less than a minute on a laptop workstation.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusion model for inverse prediction of process parameters and dendritic microstructures from mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a conditional diffusion model that proposes the optimal process parameters and predicts the microstructure for the desired mechanical properties. In materials development, it is costly to try many samples with different parameters in experiments and numerical simulations. The use of data-driven inverse design method can reduce the cost of materials development. This study develops an inverse analysis model that predicts process parameters and microstructures. This method can be used for any material, but in this study it is applied to polymeric material, which is the matrix resin of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics as an example. Matrix resins contain a mixture of dendrites, which are crystalline phases, and amorphous phases even after crystal growth is complete, and it is important to consider the microstructures consisting of the crystalline structure and the remaining amorphous phase to achieve the desired mechanical properties. Typically, the temperature during forming affects the microstructures, which in turn affect the macroscopic mechanical properties. The trained diffusion model can propose not only the processing temperature but also the microstructure when Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are given. The capability of our conditional diffusion model to represent complex dendrites is also noteworthy.</description>

      <title>Execution Welfare Across Solver-based DEXes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have evolved dramatically since the introduction of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). In recent years, solver-based protocols have emerged as an alternative venue aiming to introduce competition for routing, access to offchain liquidity, and thereby improve end-user execution. Currently, these solver auctions are hosted on opaque backends, and the extent of price improvement they provide to end users remains unclear.
  We conduct an empirical study of the execution welfare that these protocols bring to users by analyzing data across different asset profiles (USDC-WETH and PEPE-WETH). Our results indicate that, compared to vanilla routing through Uniswap V2 or V3, solver-based protocols effectively enhance execution welfare for end users on DEXes within certain trade size ranges. This effect is most pronounced with USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, and somewhat less significant with PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset.
  Additionally, we identify execution welfare discrepancies across solver-based platforms (e.g., CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, UniswapX), revealing potential inefficiencies due to solver market structure, variations in liquidity profile and inventory depth among solvers. These insights highlight both the advantages and challenges of solver-based trading, underscoring its role in improving execution outcomes while raising concerns about market concentration and competition dynamics.</description>

      <title>FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</description>
