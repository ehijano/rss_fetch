      <title>Asymmetrically Weighted Dowker Persistence and Applications in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By their nature it is difficult to differentiate chaotic dynamical systems through measurement. In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure.</description>

Abstract: We show that the map from $K({\mathbb S})$ to its chromatic completion is a connective cover and identify the fiber in $K$-theoretic terms. We combine this with recent work of Land-Mathew-Meier-Tamme to prove a form of "Waldhausen's Chromatic Convergence Conjecture": we show that the map $K({\mathbb S}_{(p)})_{(p)}\to \mathop{\rm holim} K(L^{f}_{n}{\mathbb S})_{(p)}$ is the inclusion of a wedge summand.</description>

      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>

      <title>Open-closed maps and spectral local systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  This paper has two main goals: we incorporate rank one spectral local systems $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ into the spectral category; and we prove that the bordism class $[(L,\xi)]$ defined by the open-closed map differs from the class $[L]$ by a multiplicative two-torsion element in $R^0(L)^{\times}$ determined by an action of the stable homotopy class of the Hopf map $\eta \in \pi_1^{st}$ on $\xi$. Methods include a twisting construction associating flow categories to spectral local systems, and a model for the open-closed map incorporating Schlichtkrull's construction of the trace map $BGL_1(R) \subseteq K(R) \to R$.
  The companion paper \cite{PS4} shows that (for Lagrangians which themselves admit spectral lifts) one can lift quasi-isomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\Psi$ at the cost of introducing rank one local systems. Together with the open-closed computation given here, this gives an essentially complete picture of the bordism-theoretic consequences of quasi-isomorphism in the classical exact Fukaya category.</description>

      <title>Bordism from quasi-isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a graded Liouville domain. Fix a pair of infinite loop spaces $\Psi = (\Theta \to \Phi)$ living over $(BO \to BU)$. This determines a spectral Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$ whenever $TX$ lifts to $\Phi$, containing closed exact Lagrangians $L$ for which $TL$ lifts compatibly to $\Theta$; and by Bott periodicity and index theory, a Thom spectrum $R$ with bordism theory $R_*$.
  Suppose that $L$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the Fukaya category over $\mathbb{Z}$. We prove that:
  (a) if both lift to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then there is a rank one $R$-local system $\xi: L \to BGL_1(R)$ over $L$ so that $(L,\xi)$ and $K$ are quasi-isomorphic in the spectral Fukaya category;
  (b) when $X$ is polarised and $\Psi = (BO \times F \to BO)$, if only $K$ lifts to $\mathcal{F}(X;\Psi)$, then the composition $L \to B^2GL_1(R)$ of the stable Gauss map of $L$ and the delooped $J$-homomorphism is nullhomotopic.
  Combined with the computation of the open-closed fundamental class associated to $(L,\xi)$ in \cite{PS3}, these results have applications to bordism and stable homotopy types of quasi-isomorphic Lagrangians, to Hamiltonian monodromy groups, and to smooth structures on nearby Lagrangians.
  A key ingredient in the proofs is a new form of obstruction theory for flow categories `lying over' a manifold $L$, closely related to a `spectral Viterbo restriction functor' also introduced here.</description>

      <title>AKSZ construction for shifted Poisson structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the AKSZ theorem for shifted Poisson structures: if $X$ is an $n$-shifted Poisson derived stack, and $Y$ a $d$-oriented derived stack, then the mapping stack \[\underline{\mathrm{Map}}(Y,X)\] is naturally endowed with an $(n-d)$-shifted Poisson structure. For this, we prove that the data of an $n$-shifted Poisson structure on a derived Artin stack is equivalent to the data of an $(n+1)$-shifted Lagrangian thickening of it. We also extend the definition of shifted Poisson structures to derived prestacks having a deformation theory and give two applications, one for mapping stacks with a non-proper source and one in BV formalism.</description>
