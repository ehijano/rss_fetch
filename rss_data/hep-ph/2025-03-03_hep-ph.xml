      <title>Colorful Particle Production at High-Energy Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-energy $\mu^+\mu^-$ collider provides a wide variety of mechanisms for the production of new heavy particles. While the reach for such particles via the direct annihilation of $\mu^+\mu^-$ will approach the center-of-mass energy of the collider, the partonic fusions from gauge bosons, quarks, and gluons, originating from the incoming muon beams will open new channels for single production and pair production of particles with different quantum numbers. We present the production rates for a wide variety of colored states including color-triplets, color-sextets, color-octets, leptoquarks, and leptogluons. We find that pair production from the direct annihilation of $\mu^+\mu^-$ generally has a cross section of $0.1 - 1$ fb once above the production threshold. On the other hand, pair production through the quark and gluon content of the muon leads to a cross section of roughly $10^{-4}$ fb at the same particle mass. We perform simple estimations of the mass reach for each particle and find that a 10 TeV muon collider can extend the reach for color-triplets beyond what is possible at the high luminosity run of the Large Hadron Collider. Leptoquarks and leptogluons, with sensitivity driven by single production, can also be probed to higher masses at a muon collider than what the Large Hadron Collider can reach. A final example where a muon collider has superior reach is for color-octet scalars and vectors. Together, these cases illustrate the point that a muon collider is a competitive machine for searching for colored heavy particles, thus strengthening the motivation for such lepton colliders in the energy frontier. Although our study is focused on a muon collider, our results are largely applicable to high-energy $e^+e^-$ collisions as well.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Stasis from Field-Dependent Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological stasis is a new type of epoch in the cosmological timeline during which the cosmological abundances of different energy components -- such as vacuum energy, matter, and radiation -- remain constant despite the expansion of the universe. Previous studies have shown that stasis naturally arises in various scenarios beyond the Standard Model, either through sequential decays of states in large towers or via the annihilation of a single particle species in thermal equilibrium with itself. In this work, we demonstrate that stasis can also emerge from the decay of a single particle species whose decay width is dynamically regulated by a scalar field rolling down a Hubble-mass potential. By analyzing the fixed points of the dynamical system, we identify regions of the parameter space where stasis occurs as a global attractor of cosmic evolution. We also find that, depending on the specific abundance configuration, stasis solutions can manifest as either a stable node with asymptotic behavior or a stable spiral exhibiting intrinsic oscillations. Furthermore, we present an explicit model for this realization of stasis and explore its phenomenological constraints and implications.</description>

      <title>Connecting Scales: RGE Effects in the SMEFT at the LHC and Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global interpretations of particle physics data within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), including their matching to UV-complete models, involve energy scales potentially spanning several orders of magnitude. Relating these measurements among them in terms of a common energy scale is enabled by the Renormalisation Group Equations (RGEs). Here we present a systematic assessment of the impact of RGEs, accounting for QCD, electroweak, and Yukawa corrections, in a global SMEFT fit of LEP and LHC data where individual cross-sections are assigned a characteristic energy scale. We also quantify the impact of the RGE effects in projected global fits at the HL-LHC and the FCC-ee. Finally, we assess the role that RGEs play on the sensitivity at HL-LHC and FCC-ee to representative one-particle UV models matched onto SMEFT either at tree and one-loop level. Our study emphasizes the importance of a consistent treatment of energy scales to achieve the best precision and accuracy in indirect searches for heavy new physics through precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Fluctuations and the Production of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the simplest possible candidates for dark matter is a stable scalar singlet beyond the Standard Model. If its mass is below the Hubble scale during inflation, long-wavelength modes of this scalar will be excited during inflation, and their subsequent evolution may lead to the correct relic density of dark matter. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of a spectator scalar. We examine three cases: (1) a non-interacting massive scalar, (2) a massive scalar with self-interactions of the form $\lambda_\chi \chi^p$, and (3) a massive scalar coupled to the inflaton $\phi$ through an interaction term of the form $\sigma_{n,m} \phi^n \chi^m$. In all cases, we assume minimal coupling to gravity and compare these results with the production of short-wavelength modes arising from single graviton exchange. The evolution is tracked during the reheating phase. Our findings are summarized using $(m_\chi, T_{\rm RH})$ parameter planes, where $m_\chi$ is the mass of the scalar field and $T_{\rm RH}$ is the reheating temperature after inflation. The non-interacting scalar is highly constrained, requiring $m_\chi &gt; 3 \times 10^{12}~\rm {GeV}$ and $ T_{\rm RH} \lesssim 7~\text{TeV}$ for an inflationary potential with a quadratic minimum. However, when self-interactions or couplings to the inflaton are included, the viable parameter space expands considerably. In these cases, sub-GeV and even sub-eV scalar masses can yield the correct relic abundance, opening new possibilities for light dark matter candidates. In all cases, we also impose additional constraints arising from the production of isocurvature fluctuations, the prevention of a secondary inflationary phase triggered by the spectator field, and the fragmentation of scalar condensates.</description>

      <title>Structure of cosmic strings for a gauged B-L symmetry and two Higgs fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the difference between the baryon number $B$ and the lepton number $L$ is conserved, which represents a symmetry that is global and exact, and therefore unnatural. We turn it into a naturally exact, local symmetry by coupling the quantum number $B-L$ to an Abelian gauge field. Gauge anomalies are cancelled by adding right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$, which are not sterile in this case. Therefore the usual Majorana term is forbidden by gauge symmetry, but we arrange for a $\nu_R$-mass by adding a Higgs-type 1-component complex scalar field. Thus we arrive at a modest, well-motivated extension of the Standard Model.
  In this framework, we investigate the field equations in the extended gauge-Higgs sector, involving both Higgs fields and the non-standard U(1) gauge field. They are given by a set of coupled, non-linear differential equations, which we solve numerically, focusing on the structures of cosmic strings. For a variety of parameters, we identify the string profiles and energy densities, assuming appropriate boundary conditions. In particular, these profiles depend on the winding number of each of the Higgs fields. As an amazing peculiarity, we discover -- for high winding numbers -- ``overshooting'' and ``co-axial'' solutions; in the latter case, the profile of the standard Higgs field changes its sign near the core of the cosmic string.</description>

      <title>Meson-Meson Molecular Binding Potentials in the Diabatic Dynamical Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the diabatic formalism, a rigorous generalization of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we study the effects of introducing simple meson-meson molecular potentials to an established diquark model for tetraquark states, and calculate mixed bound states composed of both diquark-antidiquark and meson-meson molecular components. We examine the behavior of properties of the states as one varies the parameters of the di-meson potential, and find that significant regions of parameter space occur in which one may produce mass eigenstates exactly matching the specific examples of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3915)$. We also find regions in which a pure di-meson molecular state emerges, and study the same state properties in such cases.</description>

      <title>Probing double hadron resonance by complex momentum representation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances are ubiquitous phenomena in nature, and physicists have developed many methods to explore resonant states. Of particular note is the complex momentum representation(CMR) method, which has been developed and widely used in the study of resonant states in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics. Here, for the first time, we have developed this novel method to study hadron resonant states. The CMR method is applied to probe the bound and resonant states for the $\Lambda_cD(\bar{D})$ and $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c(\bar{\Lambda}_c)$ systems, in which the resonant states are exposed clearly in complex momentum plane and the resonance parameters can be determined precisely without imposing unphysical parameters. The results show that the CMR method has achieving higher accuracy than other widely used methods. This method is not only very effective for narrow resonances, but also can be reliably applied to broad resonances.</description>

      <title>Resummed multi-line gamma-ray spectra for Cherenkov Telescopes from heavy spin-1 dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweakly interacting stable spin-1 particle in the $(1-10)$ TeV mass range can be a dark matter candidate with rich testability. In particular, one or even two gamma-ray line-like features are expected to be a smoking-gun signature for indirect detection in this scenario. The presence of large Sudakov logarithmic corrections, though, significantly complicates the theoretical prediction of the gamma-ray spectrum. We resum these corrections at the next-to-leading-log (NLL) accuracy using Soft-Collinear Effective field Theory (SCET). Rather interestingly, we find that the LL- and NLL-resummed endpoint spectra for this model are, up to an overall factor, identical to already existing calculations in the contexts of spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ (i.e. wino-like) scenarios. We discuss how this non-trivial "exact universality" irrespective of DM spin at these accuracies comes about despite the completely different SCET operator bases. Our resummations allow us to reduce the uncertainty, demonstrated in the energy spectrum with distinctive two peaks from annihilations into $\gamma \gamma, Z \gamma$ channel and a photon with $Z_2$-even extra heavy neutral boson $Z'$. We discuss the prospect of improving accuracy further, which is crucial for the heavier DM mass region and realistic resolution in future gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation-Based Partial Wave Analysis of $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Monte Carlo simulation-based partial wave analysis of the decay $\Xi_c^+ \to \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ by using the Feynman-Diagram-Calculation framework. The consistency of the input and output parameters implies the reliability of the partial wave analysis method. A robust method of the spin-parity determination of the $\Xi^{*0}$ resonance is introduced. The rejection significance of the alternative spin-parity hypothesis over the favored hypothesis is strong for different spins, but weak for different parities based on the current integrated luminosity of the Belle experiment. Further data collection is needed to improve the sensitivity of parity determination in the future, e.g., Belle II experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new version v1.1 of NeatIBP. In this new version, a Kira interface is included. It allows the user to reduce the integration-by-parts (IBP) identity systems generated by NeatIBP using Kira in a highly automated way. This new version also implements the so-called spanning cuts method. It helps to reduce the total computational complexity of IBP reduction for certain hard problems. Another important feature of this new version is an algorithm to simplify the solution module of the syzygy equations hinted by the idea of maximal cuts.</description>

      <title>Low mode approximation in the axion magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of interacting large scale magnetic and axionic fields. Based on the new induction equation accounting for the contribution of spatially inhomogeneous axions, we consider the evolution of a magnetized spherical axion structure. Using the thin layer approximation, we derive the system of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations for harmonics of poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, as well as for the axion field. In this system, we account for up to four modes. Considering this small and dense axion clump to be in a solar plasma, we numerically simulate the evolution of magnetic fields. We obtain that the behavior of magnetic fields depends on the initial fields configuration. Moreover, we find an indication on a magnetic field instability in the magnetohydrodynamics with inhomogeneous axions.</description>

      <title>Application of fragmentation function to the indirect production of fully charmed tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect production mechanisms of fully charmed tetraquark are analyzed using the NRQCD factorization and Suzuki approach, respectively. The process first produces a heavy charm quark through Higgs, $W^+$, or $Z^0$ decay, and then the resulting charm quark evolves into an $S$-wave fully charmed tetraquark state with quantum number $J^{PC}$, including $0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$, and $2^{++}$, via the fragmentation function. While the transverse momentum $\langle \vec{q}_T^2\rangle$ in Suzuki approach ranges from 2.01 to 299.04 GeV$^2$, the numerical results obtained from these two approaches are consistent with each other. The decay widths, branching ratios, and produced events would be predicted at LHC and CEPC, respectively. The corresponding theoretical uncertainty of heavy quark mass $m_c$ and distribution of energy fraction are also presented. The results show that the contribution for the production of $T_{4c}$ through $W^+$ decay channel at LHC is relatively large. At CEPC, a sufficient number of $T_{4c}$ events are produced through $Z^0$ decays, which is likely to be detected in future experiments.</description>

      <title>A model-independent parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ form factors relying on partial-wave decompositions and series expansions in suitable variables. We bound the expansion coefficients through unitarity and include left-hand cut contributions using established dispersive methods. The two-hadron lineshapes are treated in a model-independent manner using Omn\`es functions, thus allowing for a data-driven determination of the expansion parameters. We study the underlying composition of the di-pion system in $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays through fits to differential spectra of $B^{+} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-} \ell^+ \nu$ measured by the Belle experiment. In contrast to previous works, we are able to study the full phase-space and are not limited to certain kinematic regions. As a consequence, we extract branching fractions for the different partial waves of the di-pion system. We find: \begin{align*}
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_S \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 2.2^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_P \ell^+\nu) &amp;= 19.6^{+2.8}_{-2.7}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_D \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 3.5^{+1.3}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-5}\,. \end{align*} In addition, we derive predictions for the thus far unobserved $B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu$ decay and obtain a sizeable branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu) = 2.9^{+0.9}_{-0.7}\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Di-Higgs and Effective Field Theory: Signal Reweighting Beyond $m_{hh}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Di-Higgs ($hh$) production is crucial for probing the Higgs boson self-interaction and understanding the electroweak phase transition. Deviations from Standard Model predictions in $hh$ gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) can be systematically parameterized using effective field theories (EFT), such as Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) and Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), as long as the conditions of the EFT are fulfilled. This note presents an improved EFT signal reweighting method that addresses the limitations of approaches that rely solely on the invariant mass of the di-Higgs system $m_{hh}$, which fail to capture variations in kinematic variables such as the Higgs boson transverse momentum. We show that these limitations are particularly pronounced in scenarios involving strong destructive interference. The proposed method is developed for both EFTs for $hh$ ggF at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV at next-to-leading order in QCD. We demonstrate a reweighting technique that combines more than one EFT reference sample while incorporating multiple key variables of ggF. These enhancements improve accuracy across phase space, particularly in capturing variation of the Higgs boson transverse momentum. The method employs a convex combination of the reference samples, with weights parametrized by a distance measure, to achieve a more precise reweighting. In principle, this approach can be extended to other processes, provided that suitable reference samples and distance measure are carefully chosen.</description>

      <title>Exploring new physics in the FCNC $B_c \to D_s \nu \bar{\nu}$ channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare $b \to s \ell^+\ell^-$ transition is a well-explored transition, particularly for new physics beyond the standard model. Similar to this transition, another flavor changing neutral current transition $b \to s \nu\bar{\nu}$ involving a dineutrino pair also plays an important role in the search for new physics. The $B \to K \nu\bar{\nu}$ mode is one such dineutrino channel that has been analyzed in many works both within the standard model and beyond standard model framework. In this paper, we investigate the $B_c \to D_s \nu\bar{\nu}$ decay channel which proceeds via the $b \to s \nu\bar{\nu}$ transition. We consider an effective Hamiltonian framework involving new physics currents. To explore these currents further, we also analyse the decay mode within the $V_2$ leptoquark model. In our analysis, we use the form factors that have been obtained in lattice QCD calculations. We then make predictions of the $B_c \to D_s \nu\bar{\nu}$ branching fraction both within the standard model and beyond.</description>

      <title>The rho-pi puzzle and vector glueball mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\psi(3686)$ is identified as the radial excitation of the $J/\psi$. Based on perturbative QCD, the branching ratio of the $\psi(3686)$ into some final hadron state should be approximately 13% of the branching ratio of the $J/\psi$ to that same hadron final state. This is called the "13\% rule". However, certain decay channels such as the $\rho\pi$ severely violate this 13% rule. Using the extended Linear Sigma Model, we study the effect a small mixing angle between the $\psi(3686)$ and the vector glueball can have on the 13% rule. We show that in a simple model the mixing can already suppress $\psi(3686)$ decays sufficiently to match the $\rho\pi$ observation, but to fully describe the data a more sophisticated model is necessary. We also show that matching to data can tell us about the magnitude of glueball decay widths.</description>

      <title>Mono-lepton Signature of a Neutrino-philic Dark Fermion at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter at high-energy colliders and direct detection experiments can effectively cover nearly the entire mass range from the MeV to the TeV scale. In this paper, we focus on four-fermion contact interactions formulated within the framework of Effective Field Theory. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of mono-lepton production at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that tensor operators exhibit superior sensitivity in the mono-lepton channel, constraining energy scales up to 3\,TeV for a nearly massless dark fermion using current LHC data. Moreover, these operators mediate both spin-independent and spin-dependent absorption processes in nuclear targets. A systematic comparison of constraints between direct detection experiments and collider measurements reveals the LHC's distinct advantage in exploring sub-GeV dark matter candidates while maintaining competitive sensitivity at the TeV scale. Notably, direct detection experiments such as Super-Kamiokande and Borexino achieve complementary constraints in the 10-100\,TeV mass range through their unique capabilities: utilization of light nuclei targets, large exposure volumes, and distinctive features of the recoil energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Modulation signals of solar reflected dark matter in crystal-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering of light dark matter (DM) off thermal electrons within the Sun generates a ``fast'' sub-component of the DM flux that can be detected in underground direct detection experiments. This ``fast'' sub-component has a specific origin-namely, from the Sun. In this study, we demonstrate that in detectors composed of single crystals, like in Bragg scattering, the collision rate and energy deposition are influenced by the angle between the momentum of the incoming DM and the orientations of the crystallographic axes. This results in a directional modulation of the signal. We calculate the magnitude of directional modulations for both germanium and silicon crystals, considering both the contact interaction and light mediator scenarios. Our findings indicate that for the contact interaction case, the daily modulation of the collision rate is approximately 0.1% of the total, while in the light mediator case, it can reach as high as 30%. Additionally, our analysis suggests that future ton-scale crystal detectors will be able to explore the freeze-in DM regime with $m_{\rm{DM}} \sim 0.1 \rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>$SO(10)$ theory on the plateau: the importance of being renormalizable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a minimal renormalisable $SO(10)$ grand unified theory, with the Higgs representation $45_{\rm H}$, $126_{\rm H}$ and complex $10_{\rm H}$, responsible for the unification, intermediate and the weak scale symmetry breaking, respectively. We perform the study of unification constraints and find that it allows for the Left-Right symmetric scale to be accessible even at the LHC, and the Quark-Lepton unification scale as low as its phenomenological limit around $10^5\,$GeV. Moreover, one can have neutron - anti neutron oscillations at the level of the present day sensibility in both of the above cases, while in the former case one can have simultaneously neutrinoless double beta decay induced by new light scalar states, reachable today - with both electrons emerging as left-handed, as in the neutrino exchange through its possible Majorana mass. We also discuss a recently raised issue of the fine-tuning of the light Higgs mass and its potential conflict with low intermediate mass scales.</description>

      <title>Does the 220 PeV Event at KM3NeT Point to New Physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the observation of KM3-230213A, a neutrino event with an energy exceeding 100 PeV, more than an order of magnitude higher than the most energetic neutrino in IceCube's catalog. Given its longer data-taking period and larger effective area relative to KM3NeT, IceCube should have observed events around that energy. This tension has recently been quantified to lie between $2\sigma$ and $3.5\sigma$, depending on the neutrino source. A $\mathscr{O}(100)$ PeV neutrino detected at KM3NeT has traversed approximately $147$ km of rock and sea en route to the detector, whereas neutrinos arriving from the same location in the sky would have only traveled through about $14$ km of ice before reaching IceCube. We use this difference in propagation distance to address the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which the source emits sterile neutrinos that partially convert to active neutrinos through oscillations. We scrutinize two such realizations, one where a new physics matter potential induces a resonance in sterile-to-active transitions and another one where off-diagonal neutrino non-standard interactions are employed. In both cases, sterile-to-active neutrino oscillations become relevant at length scales of $\sim100$ km, resulting in increased active neutrino flux near the KM3NeT detector, alleviating the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Overall, we propose the exciting possibility that neutrino telescopes may have started detecting new physics.</description>

      <title>General Constraints on Isocurvature from the CMB and Ly-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current cosmological data are well-described by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which assumes adiabatic initial conditions for the primordial density perturbations. This agreement between data and theory enables strong constraints on new physics that generates isocurvature perturbations. Existing constraints typically assume a simple power law form for the isocurvature power spectrum. However, many new physics scenarios -- such as cosmological phase transitions and gravitational particle production -- can deviate from this assumption. To derive general constraints which apply to a wide variety of new physics scenarios, we consider four types of isocurvature modes (dark matter, baryon, dark radiation and neutrino density isocurvature) and parametrize the isocurvature power spectrum using two general forms: a delta function and a broken power law. Using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and CMB spectral distortions, we place constraints on the isocurvature power spectrum across a wide range of scales, from $10^{-4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a novel realization of dark bubble cosmology in non-supersymmetric string theory. Among the simplest models in ten dimensions, the type 0'B orientifold is the unique option which yields a scale-separated construction. The resulting setting produces a logarithmically varying dynamical dark energy, reflecting its holographic counterpart in terms of running gauge couplings. We analyze in detail the phenomenological consequences of the model for particle physics, inflation and late-time cosmology. We find that, although particle physics may be consistently realized, neither early-time nor late-time are observationally viable.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Quantum Gravity in Gravitational Wave Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms on the gravitational wave memory effect. In certain quantum gravity theories and semi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects) exhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger waveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the detector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features following the initial ringdown phase. Detecting such echoes, or their indirect signatures, would offer compelling evidence for the quantum nature of black holes. Given that direct detection of echoes requires finely tuned waveform templates, exploring alternative imprints of this phenomenon is crucial. In this work, we pursue this goal by calculating corrections to the null memory arising from echo-like features, formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar ${\Psi}_0$. We demonstrate that the morphology of the resulting features is model-independent rendering them conceptually much easier to detect in real interferometer data than the raw echo. The corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of echo-induced features appearing in the gravitational wave memory is estimated subsequently. We further compute the physical fluxes associated to the echo at both the black hole horizon and null infinity and identify novel distinguishing features of the underlying reflectivity models in measurement data.</description>

      <title>Constraining Anisotropic Universe Through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: A Case Study of The Bianchi Type-I Universe</title>

Abstract: The isotropy and homogeneity of our Universe are the cardinal principles of modern cosmology built on the definition of metric through the prescription by Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). From the aspects of geometry, the presence of anisotropy, inhomogeneity, or both are allowed in the metrics defined as the Bianchi type I and V metrics. In this letter, the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) formalism, and the latest observational constraints on nuclear abundances are being used to put bounds on the global anisotropy offered in the Bianchi type I metrics, providing a new path to explore in the background of global anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Bound-state formation and thermalization within the Lindblad approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, as one approach to open quantum systems, describes the density matrix of a particle or a chain of interacting particles, which are in contact with a thermal bath. Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.
  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc.</description>

Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>Inelastic and elastic parton scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of inelastic processes in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) based on the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). In the DQPM the non-perturbative properties of the sQGP at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ are described in terms of strongly interacting off-shell partons (quarks and gluons) with dynamically generated spectral functions whose properties are adjusted to reproduce the lQCD EoS for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. For the first time the massive gluon radiation processes from the off-shell quark-quark ($q+q$) and quark-gluon ($q+g$) scatterings are calculated explicitly within leading order Feynman diagrams with effective propagators and vertices from the DQPM without any further approximations. We present the results for the energy and temperature dependencies of the total and differential radiative cross sections and compare them to the corresponding elastic cross sections. We show that our results reproduce the pQCD calculations in the limit of zero masses and widths of quasiparticles. Also we study the $\mu_B$ dependence of the inelastic cross sections. Moreover, we present estimates for the transition rate and relaxation time of radiative versus elastic scatterings in the sQGP.</description>

      <title>On-shell recursion and holomorphic HQET for heavy quark hadronic resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical framework for the treatment of heavy quark (HQ) resonances within heavy quark effective theory (HQET). This framework uses on-shell recursion techniques to express the resonant amplitude as a product of on-shell subamplitudes, which allows one to employ a form-factor representation of the hadronic matrix elements and to obtain an HQ expansion, but at the price of introducing complex momenta. We construct a generalized ``holomorphic HQET'' onto which such complex-momentum matrix elements can be matched, and we show that $PT$ symmetry ensures the Isgur-Wise functions (and the perturbative corrections) become holomorphic functions of the complex recoil parameter with real coefficients. They are thus an analytic continuation of the standard HQET description. This framework admits a HQ hadron (strong decay) width expansion. At second order, we show it is compatible with data for the $B_{1(2)}^{(*)}$ and $D_{1(2)}^{(*)}$ HQ doublets. Taking the $\bar{B} \to (D_1^*(1^-) \to D\pi)l\nu$ system as an example, we compute the holomorphic HQET expansion to first order, as well as the complex-momentum on-shell subamplitudes. A toy numerical study of the resulting differential rates demonstrates that this framework generates HQ resonance lineshapes with large tails, resembling those seen in data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Composition of the Single-Charm Molecular Pentaquarks: Insights from Radiative Decay and Magnetic Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to unravel the composition of the isoscalar $DN$, $D^*N$, $D_1N$, and $D_2^*N$ molecular pentaquarks, we carry out a systematic investigation of their M1 and E1 radiative decays and magnetic moment properties. Using the constituent quark model and taking into account the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect, our analysis yields numerical results indicating that the M1 and E1 radiative decays and the magnetic moment properties of these molecular pentaquarks provide some insights into their inner structures. These results can provide crucial clues for distinguishing their spin-parity quantum numbers and configurations in experimental studies. In addition, we highlight the importance of the electromagnetic properties as key observables for elucidating the inner structures of the observed $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$. We hope that these findings can inspire our experimental colleagues to further explore the family of the single-charm molecular pentaquarks and to investigate the inner structures of the $\Lambda_c^{+} (2940)$ and $\Lambda_c^{+} (2910)$ in future studies.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Light New Particles in $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Belle II observation of $B \to K E_{\rm miss}$ challenges theoretical interpretations in terms of Standard Model neutrino final states. Instead, we consider new physics scenarios where up to two new light-invisible particles of spin 0 up to 3/2 are present in the final state. We identify viable scenarios by reconstructing the (binned) likelihoods of the relevant $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ and also $B_s \to E_{\rm miss}$ experimental analyses and present preferred regions of couplings and masses. In particular, we find that the current data prefers two-body decay kinematics involving the emission of a single massive scalar or a vector particle, or alternatively, three-body decays involving pairs of massive scalars or spin 1/2 fermions. When applicable, we compare our findings with existing literature and briefly discuss some model-building implications.</description>

      <title>Two-photon decay of para-positronium within a composite approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of the para-positronium into two photons is studied in the framework of a composite Quantum Field Theoretical approach. This amounts to the evaluation of the electron-positron dressing together with the Weinberg compositeness condition for the positronium and the triangle-shaped diagram with virtual electrons circulating in it, leading to the two-photon final state. An important role is played by the positronium-electron-positron vertex, which is linked to the wave function of the para-positronium. We show how possible choices for the vertex function affect the $\gamma \gamma$ decay rate. Outlooks to other decay channels and to other positronia are presented.</description>

      <title>From Supernovae to Neutron Stars: A Systematic Approach to Axion Production at Finite Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of QCD axion production in environments with finite baryon density and temperature, implying significant changes to axion phenomenology. Within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, we derive the effective Lagrangian describing axion interactions with nucleons and mesons up to next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion. We focus on corrections to the axion-nucleon couplings from higher orders and finite density. These couplings are modified by up to an order of magnitude near nuclear saturation density, significantly impacting axion production in supernovae and neutron stars. Density-dependent corrections enhance the axion luminosity in supernovae by an order of magnitude, strengthening current best bounds by a factor of three. We stress the importance of including all axion production channels up to a given chiral order for a consistent luminosity calculation and classify the missing contributions up to the third chiral order. The modified axion-nucleon couplings also affect neutron star cooling rates via axion emission. A re-evaluation of existing neutron star cooling bounds, constrained to regions where perturbative control is reliable, weakens these bounds by a factor of four. Lastly, our results have implications for terrestrial axion searches that rely on precise knowledge of axion-nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>Effects of threshold resummation for large-$x$ PDF in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large $x$ are challenging to extract from experimental data, yet they are essential for understanding hadron structure and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the framework of the large momentum $P^z$ expansion of lattice quasi-PDFs, we investigate large $x$ PDFs, where the matching coefficient is factorized into the hard kernel, related to the active quark momentum $x P^z$, and the threshold soft function, associated with the spectator momentum $(1-x) P^z$. The renormalization group equation of the soft function enables the resummation of the threshold double logarithms $\alpha^{k} \ln^{2k}(1-x)$, which is crucial for a reliable and controllable calculation of large $x$ PDFs. Our analysis with pion valence PDFs indicates that perturbative matching breaks down when the spectator momentum $(1-x)P^z$ approaches $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, but remains valid when both $x P^z$ and $(1-x)P^z$ are much larger than $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Additionally, we incorporate leading renormalon resummation within the threshold framework, demonstrating good perturbative convergence in the region where both spectator and active quark momenta are perturbative scales.</description>

      <title>Electroweak renormalization of neutralino-Higgs interactions at one-loop and its impacts on spin-independent direct detection of Wino-like dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Wino-like neutralino dark matter (DM) in the form of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) has been considered one of the popular paradigms that can naturally accommodate {\it new physics} at a relatively higher scale, typically beyond the reach of the LHC. The constraint on the DM relic density typically implies a lightest neutralino mass $\simeq 2$ TeV. Its observational signature through nuclear recoil experiments, specifically involving DM-nucleon spin-independent (SI) scattering, is not impressive, following its high masses and tiny Higgsino fractions. The theoretical calculations can be improved when we compute all the one-loop electroweak (EW) corrections to the three-point vertices for the neutralino (Wino)-Higgs interactions, which in turn boosts the DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections through the SM-like Higgs exchange. Importantly, we include the counterterm contributions. In addition, we incorporate the other next-to-leading order (NLO) EW DM-quark and DM-gluon interactions present in the literature to calculate the DM-nucleon cross-sections. With the improved and precise theoretical estimates, DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections may increase or decrease significantly by more than $100\%$ compared to leading order (LO) cross-sections in different parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current laboratory bounds imply that protons are extremely long-lived. However, this conclusion may not hold for all time and in all of space. We find that the proton lifetime can be $\sim 15$ orders of magnitude shorter in the relatively recent past on Earth, or at the present time elsewhere in the Milky Way. A number of terrestrial and astrophysical constraints are examined and potential signals are outlined. We also sketch possible models that could lead to spatial or temporal variations in the proton lifetime. A positive signal could be compelling evidence for a new long range force of Nature, with important implications for the limitations of fundamental inferences based solely on laboratory measurements.</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame, as required for the pole inflation. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying the general form of the Weyl invariant Lagrangian to both the Higgs pole inflation and the PQ pole inflation, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently in the case of the PQ pole inflation, due to a large effective axion decay constant during inflation.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, we find no candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ in the quark model.</description>

      <title>Isgur-Wise functions for $\boldsymbol{\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm \right)}$ transitions in the Bakamjian-Thomas Relativistic Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the transitions ${\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm \right)}$ in the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) relativistic quark model formalism, which describes hadrons with a fixed number of constituents. In the heavy quark limit, the BT model yields covariant form factors and Isgur-Wise (IW) scaling, regardless of the spectroscopic model used to describe the bound states. It has been extensively applied to heavy mesons where subtle properties of the IW limit of QCD, including the Bjorken-Uraltsev sum rules, have been shown to be satisfied. The present paper, where the BT construction is applied to baryons, is unavoidably technical because one is dealing with a three-body problem. The complications originate from the natural choice of the Jacobi coordinates ${\vec \rho}$ (relative space coordinate between the two light spectator quarks) and ${\vec \lambda}$ (relative space coordinate between the center-of-mass of the two light quarks and the heavy quark). The corresponding orbital angular momenta are denoted by ${\vec \ell}_\rho$ and ${\vec \ell}_\lambda$, with ${\vec \ell}_\rho + {\vec \ell}_\lambda = {\vec L}$. For the transitions $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c\left({1 \over 2}^\pm\right)$, i.e. $L = 0 \to L = 0$ or $L = 0 \to L = 1$, one can see that the moduli $\ell_\rho$ and $\ell_\lambda$ can take an infinite number of values. For $L = 0 \to L = 0$ one has the constraint $\ell_\lambda = \ell_\rho$ and for $L = 0 \to L = 1$ the constraint is $\ell_\lambda = \ell_\rho \pm 1$. We compute explicitly the IW function $\xi_\Lambda (w)$ in the elastic case $\Lambda_b \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right) \to \Lambda_c \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right)$ and the much more involved IW function $\sigma_\Lambda (w)$ in the inelastic case $\Lambda_b \left({1 \over 2}^+ \right) \to \Lambda_c \left({1 \over 2}^- \right)$. These functions exhibit the expected properties of covariance and IW scaling.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $8\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2.5\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

      <title>Measuring Quantum Discord at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in exploring quantities associated with quantum information at colliders. We perform a detailed analysis describing how to measure the quantum discord in the top anti-top quantum state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). While for pure states, quantum discord, entanglement, and Bell nonlocality all probe the same correlations, for mixed states they probe different aspects of quantum correlations. The quantum discord, in particular, is interesting because it aims to encapsulate all correlations between systems that cannot have a classical origin. We employ two complementary approaches for the study of the top anti-top system, namely the decay method and the kinematic method. We highlight subtleties associated with measuring discord for reconstructed quantum states at colliders. Usually quantum discord is difficult to compute due to an extremization that must be performed. We show, however, that for the $t\bar{t}$ system this extremization can be performed analytically and we provide closed-form formulas for the quantum discord. We demonstrate that at the high luminosity LHC, discord is projected to be measurable with a precision of approximately 5% using the decay method and sub-percent levels using the kinematic method. Even with current LHC datasets, discord can be measured with 1-2% precision with the kinematic method. By systematically investigating quantum discord for the first time through a detailed collider analysis, this work expands the toolkit for quantum information studies in particle physics and lays the groundwork for deeper insights into the quantum properties in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Matter the origin of the $B\to K \nu\bar\nu$ excess at Belle II?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of $B^+\to K^+ +\,\text{invisible}$ events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.</description>

Abstract: We examine bounds on accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of the moduli space in string theory compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. While there are conjectures that forbid or constrain accelerated expansion in such asymptotic regions, potential counter examples have been discussed recently in the literature. We check whether such counter examples can arise in explicit string theory constructions, focusing in particular on non-geometric compactifications of type IIB string theory that have no K\"ahler moduli. We find no violation of the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture and thus provide support for the absence of accelerated expansion in asymptotic regions of a barely explored corner of the string landscape. Moreover, working in a simplified setting, we point out a new mechanism for potentially connecting the Sharpened Distance Conjecture and the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture. If this argument could be generalized, it would mean that the Sharpened Distance Conjecture is implied by the Strong Asymptotic dS Conjecture, and that their exponential factors are naturally related by a factor of 2.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are comparable to the week-long exposures obtained by NICER on various individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If these dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>Constraints on blue and red tilted primordial power spectra using dwarf galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the standard $\Lambda$+Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well tested on large scales, the primordial power spectrum may deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM spectrum on small scales due to specific dark matter properties or alternative inflationary models. These deviations affect the formation of dark matter structure, which subsequently leads to different observable properties of galaxies. In this work, we study the impact of a blue and red tilted power spectrum on the central density of dwarf galaxies. To do this, we model densities of dwarf galaxies using a combination of high-resolution numerical simulations and galaxy formation model. The model galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM are consistent with observations of 41 faint dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum are constrained by the central matter densities of dwarf galaxies, which set stringent constraints on the possible small-scale tilt of the primordial power spectrum, improving on the current limits. Moreover, similar analysis can be applied to test any feature in the power spectrum at small scales between $k\sim 10-100$~Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight bosons. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we focus on the superradiance of a scalar boson, and perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modeled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Moments from Momentum Derivatives in Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but "dressed" by the condensate profile) and the second to the "skewness" of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations when such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Particle production from inhomogeneities: general metric perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</description>
