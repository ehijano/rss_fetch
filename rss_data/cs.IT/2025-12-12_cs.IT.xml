      <title>Fourier Sparsity of Delta Functions and Matching Vector PIRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a basic and natural question about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which has applications to the study of Matching Vector based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -&gt; C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?
  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying "S-decoding polynomials" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.
  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers. Many interesting questions remain open.</description>

      <title>Improving the decoding performance of CA-polar codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of modern code-agnostic decoders to convert CA-SCL from an incomplete decoder to a complete one. When CA-SCL fails to identify a codeword that passes the CRC check, we apply a code-agnostic decoder that identifies a codeword that satisfies the CRC. We establish that this approach gives gains of up to 0.2 dB in block error rate for CA-Polar codes from the 5G New Radio standard. If, instead, the message had been encoded in a systematic CA-polar code, the gain improves to 0.2 ~ 1dB. Leveraging recent developments in blockwise soft output, we additionally establish that it is possible to control the undetected error rate even when using the CRC for error correction.</description>

      <title>PANDAExpress: a Simpler and Faster PANDA Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PANDA is a powerful generic algorithm for answering conjunctive queries (CQs) and disjunctive datalog rules (DDRs) given input degree constraints. In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs.
  The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\tilde O(\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power.</description>

      <title>On Simplest Kochen-Specker Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 190203 (2025) a discovery of the simplest 3D contextual set with 33 vertices, 50 bases, and 14 complete bases is claimed. In this paper, we show that it was previously generated in Quantum 7, 953 (2023) and analyze the meaning, origin, and significance of the simplest contextual sets in any dimension. In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.</description>

      <title>CSI-Based User Positioning, Channel Charting, and Device Classification with an NVIDIA 5G Testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel-state information (CSI)-based sensing will play a key role in future cellular systems. However, no CSI dataset has been published from a real-world 5G NR system that facilitates the development and validation of suitable sensing algorithms. To close this gap, we publish three real-world wideband multi-antenna multi-open RAN radio unit (O-RU) CSI datasets from the 5G NR uplink channel: an indoor lab/office room dataset, an outdoor campus courtyard dataset, and a device classification dataset with six commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) user equipments (UEs). These datasets have been recorded using a software-defined 5G NR testbed based on NVIDIA Aerial RAN CoLab Over-the-Air (ARC-OTA) with COTS hardware, which we have deployed at ETH Zurich. We demonstrate the utility of these datasets for three CSI-based sensing tasks: neural UE positioning, channel charting in real-world coordinates, and closed-set device classification. For all these tasks, our results show high accuracy: neural UE positioning achieves 0.6cm (indoor) and 5.7cm (outdoor) mean absolute error, channel charting in real-world coordinates achieves 73cm mean absolute error (outdoor), and device classification achieves 99% (same day) and 95% (next day) accuracy. The CSI datasets, ground-truth UE position labels, CSI features, and simulation code are publicly available at https://caez.ethz.ch</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Learning Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.</description>

Abstract: Compositional graphoids are fundamental discrete structures which appear in probabilistic reasoning, particularly in the area of graphical models. They are semigraphoids which satisfy the Intersection and Composition properties. These important properties, however, are not enjoyed by general probability distributions. This paper surveys what is known about them, providing systematic constructions of examples and counterexamples as well as necessary and sufficient conditions. Novel sufficient conditions for both properties are derived in the context of discrete random variables via information-theoretic tools.</description>

      <title>Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes &amp; Fractional Matchings in Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph based lower bound on Pliable Index Coding based on Nested Side-Information Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information, and requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of length $\ell$ is a set of $\ell$ encoded transmissions broadcast from the server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum) length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we present a new lower bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter called the nesting number, denoted by $\eta(\ch)$ associated with the hypergraph $\ch$ that represents the PICOD problem. While the nesting number bound is not stronger than previously known bounds, it can provide some computational advantages over them. Also, using the nesting number bound, we obtain novel lower bounds for some PICOD problems with special structures, which are tight in some cases.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho \to 0$, the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $&gt; 400$-fold and $&gt; 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, establishing provably tight bounds between them. We use these results to refine other divergence inequalities, in particular sharpening bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</description>

      <title>Stokes' theorem as an entropy-extremizing duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16386</link>

Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all codimension-1 submanifolds of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ uniquely maximizes the associated entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby a manifold's boundary is its 'least informative' subset satisfying the Stokes relation.</description>
