      <title>How to (Un-) Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.06981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When compared to quantum mechanics, classical mechanics is often depicted in a specific metaphysical flavour: spatio-temporal realism or a Newtonian "background" is presented as an intrinsic fundamental classical presumption. However, the Hamiltonian formulation of classical analytical mechanics is based on abstract generalized coordinates and momenta: It is a mathematical rather than a philosophical framework. If the metaphysical assumptions ascribed to classical mechanics are dropped, then there exists a presentation in which little of the purported difference between quantum and classical mechanics remains. This presentation allows to derive the mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics on the basis of a purely classical Hamiltonian phase space picture. It is shown that a spatio-temporal description is not a condition for but a consequence of objectivity. It requires no postulates. This is achieved by evading spatial notions and assuming nothing but time translation invariance.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate complete elliptic integrals for the full range of modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete elliptic integral of the first and second kind, K(k) and E(k), appear in a multitude of physics and engineering applications. Because there is no known closed-form, the exact values have to be computed numerically. Here, approximations for the integrals are proposed based on their asymptotic behaviors. An inverse of K is also presented. As a result, the proposed K(k) and E(k) reproduce the exact analytical forms both in the zero and asymptotic limits, while in the mid-range of modulus maintain average error of 0.06% and 0.01% respectively. The key finding is the ability to compute the integrals with exceptional accuracy on both limits of elliptical conditions. An accuracy of 1 in 1,000 should be sufficient for practical or prototyping engineering and architecture designs. The simplicity should facilitate discussions of advanced physics topics in introductory physics classes, and enable broader collaborations among researchers from other fields of expertise. For example, the phase space of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum using only elementary functions is discussed. The proposed inverse of K is shown to be Never Failing Newton Initialization and is an important step for the computation of the exact inverse. An algorithm based on Arithmetic-Geometric Mean for computing exact integrals and their derivatives are also presented, which should be useful in a platform that special functions are not accessible such as web-based and firmware developments.</description>
