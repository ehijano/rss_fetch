      <title>On self-similar solutions of a multi-phase Stefan problem in the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study self-similar solutions of a multi-phase Stefan problem for a heat equation on the half-line $x&gt;0$ with a constant initial data and with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. In the case of Dirichlet boundary condition we prove that a nonlinear algebraic system for determination of the free boundaries is gradient one and the corresponding potential is an explicitly written strictly convex and coercive function. Therefore, there exists a unique minimum point of the potential, coordinates of this point determine free boundaries and provide the desired solution. In the case of Neumann boundary condition we demonstrate that the problem may have solutions with different numbers (called types) of phase transitions. For each fixed type $n$ the system for determination of the free boundaries is again gradient and the corresponding potential is proved to be strictly convex and coercive, but in some wider non-physical domain. In particular, a solution of type $n$ is unique and can exist only if the minimum point of the potential belongs to the physical domain. We provide an explicit criteria for existence of solutions of any type $n$. Due to the rather complicated structure of the set of solutions, neither existence nor uniqueness of a solution to Stefan-Neumann problem are guaranteed. Bibliography: 5 titles.</description>

      <title>On an obstacle problem for the Brakke flow with a generalized right-angle boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Brakke's mean curvature flow with obstacles and with a right-angle boundary condition. Assuming that the obstacles have $C^{1,1}$-boundaries we prove that a weak solution exists globally in time. To show the existence we apply the phase-field method and thus investigate the singular limit of the Allen-Cahn equation with forcing term and homogeneous Neumann bounday condition. We also construct sub- and supersolutions that correspond to the obstacles.</description>

      <title>Time-harmonic wave propagation in junctions of two periodic half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the Helmholtz equation in a junction of two periodic half-spaces. When the overall medium is periodic in the direction of the interface, Fliss and Joly (2019) proposed a method which consists in applying a partial Floquet-Bloch transform along the interface, to obtain a family of waveguide problems parameterized by the Floquet variable. In this paper, we consider two model configurations where the medium is no longer periodic in the direction of the interface. Inspired by the works of G\'erard-Varet and Masmoudi (2011, 2012), and Blanc, Le Bris, and Lions (2015), we use the fact that the overall medium has a so-called quasiperiodic structure, in the sense that it is the restriction of a higher dimensional periodic medium. Accordingly, the Helmholtz equation is lifted onto a higher dimensional problem with coefficients that are periodic along the interface. This periodicity property allows us to adapt the tools previously developed for periodic media. However, the augmented PDE is elliptically degenerate (in the sense of the principal part of its differential operator) and thus more delicate to analyse.</description>

      <title>Global existence and asymptotic behavior of the Westervelt--hyperbolic Pennes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global existence and asymptotic behavior of a mathematical model of nonlinear ultrasonic heating based on a coupled system of the Westervelt equation and the hyperbolic Pennes bioheat equation (Westervelt--Pennes--Cattaneo model). First, we prove that the solution exists globally in time, provided that the lower-order Sobolev norms of the initial data are considered to be small, while the higher-order norms can be arbitrarily large. This is done using a continuity argument together with some interpolation inequalities. Second, we prove an exponential decay of the solution under the same smallness assumptions on the initial data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Cheeger's constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cheeger constant of an open set of the Euclidean space is defined by minimizing the ratio "perimeter over volume", among all its smooth compactly contained subsets. We consider a natural variant of this problem, where the volume of admissible sets is raised to any positive power. We show that for {\it sublinear} powers, all these generalized Cheeger constants are equivalent to the standard one, by means of a universal two-sided estimate. We also show that this equivalence breaks down for {\it superlinear} powers. In this case, some weird phenomena appear. We finally consider the case of convex planar sets and prove an existence result, under optimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation diagrams of semilinear elliptic equations for supercritical nonlinearities in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with general supercritical nonlinearities in the two-dimensional unit ball. In this paper, we prove the non-existence of an unstable solution for any small parameter and the uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions. As a result, we obtain the existence of a radial singular solution and prove that the bifurcation curve has infinitely many turning points. We remark that these properties are well-known in $N$ dimensions with $3\le N \le 9$ and less known in two dimensions. The key idea of the proof is to utilize an interaction between a key gradient estimate of solutions and the supercriticality of the nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs for some semilinear PDEs on $H^2(e^{|x|^2/4},\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop computer-assisted tools to study semilinear equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla{u}= f(x,u,\nabla u) ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d. \end{equation*} Such equations appear naturally in several contexts, and in particular when looking for self-similar solutions of parabolic PDEs. We develop a general methodology, allowing us not only to prove the existence of solutions, but also to describe them very precisely. We introduce a spectral approach based on an eigenbasis of $\mathcal{L}:= -\Delta -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla$ in spherical coordinates, together with a quadrature rule allowing to deal with nonlinearities, in order to get accurate approximate solutions. We then use a Newton-Kantorovich argument, in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, to prove the existence of a nearby exact solution. We apply our approach to nonlinear heat equations, to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and to a generalised viscous Burgers equation, and obtain both radial and non-radial self-similar profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our focus lies on a fundamental geometric invariant known as Riesz capacity, which holds an essential position in potential theory. We establish the Hadamard variational formula for Riesz capacity of convex bodies. As a meaningful application, we derive a Serrin-type symmetry result for an overdetermined problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the De Giorgi iteration technique to the vectorial setting. For this we replace the usual scalar truncation operator by a vectorial shortening operator. As an application, we prove local boundedness for local and nonlocal nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we show convex hull properties, which are a generalization of the maximum principle to the case of systems.</description>

      <title>Periodic travelling interfacial electrohydrodynamic waves: bifurcation and secondary bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two-dimensional periodic capillary-gravity waves travelling under the effect of a vertical electric field are considered. The full system is a nonlinear, two-layered and free boundary problem. The interface dynamics arises from the coupling between the Euler equations for the lower fluid layer and an electric contribution from the upper gas layer. To investigate the electrohydrodynamic wave interactions, we first introduce the naive flattening technique to transform the free boundary problem into a fixed boundary problem. Then we prove the existence of the small-amplitude electrohydrodynamic waves with constant vorticity $\gamma$ by using local bifurcation theory. Moreover, we prove that these electrohydrodynamic waves are formally stable in linearized sense. Furthermore, we obtain a secondary bifurcation curve that emerges from the primary branch at a nonlaminar solution as $E_0$ being close to some special value. This secondary bifurcation curve consists of ripples solutions on the interface of a conducting fluid under normal electric fields. As far as we know, this new phenomenon in electrohydrodynamics (EHD) is first established mathematically. It is worth noting that the electric field $E_0$ plays a key role to control the shapes and types of waves on the interface.</description>

      <title>The existence of stratified linearly steady two-mode water waves with stagnation points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of stratified steady periodic water waves that contain stagnation points. The initial step involves transforming the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear pseudodifferential equation through a conformal mapping technique, resulting in a periodic function of a single variable. By utilizing the theorems developed by Crandall and Rabinowitz, we establish the existence and formal stability of small-amplitude steady periodic capillary-gravity water waves in the presence of stratified linear flows. Notably, the stability of bifurcation solution curves is strongly influenced by the stratified nature of the system. Additionally, as the Bernoulli's function $\beta$ approaches critical values, we observe that the linearized problem exhibits a two-dimensional kernel. Consequently, we apply a bifurcation theorem due to Kielh\"{o}fer that incorporates multiple-dimensional kernels and parameters, which enables us to establish the existence of two-mode water waves. As far as we know, the two-mode water waves in stratified flow are first constructed by us. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of internal stagnation points within these waves.</description>

      <title>The global bifurcation of periodic internal waves with point vortex and capillary effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first construct two-dimensional periodic interface waves with point vortex and capillary effect and then obtain the global structure of the set of solutions. This is done using the local and global bifurcation argument. Especially, we establish a global continuation theorem by using the degree for $C^1$ Fredholm mappings. As far as we know, the global result is new and general, which is promising to deal with other new phenomena in water waves.</description>

      <title>On classification of global dynamics for energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flows and radial nonlinear heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the global dynamics of finite energy solutions to energy-critical equivariant harmonic map heat flow (HMHF) and radial nonlinear heat equation (NLH). It is known that any finite energy equivariant solutions to (HMHF) decompose into finitely many harmonic maps (bubbles) separated by scales and a body map, as approaching to the maximal time of existence. Our main result for (HMHF) gives a complete classification of their dynamics for equivariance indices $D\geq3$; (i) they exist globally in time, (ii) the number of bubbles and signs are determined by the energy class of the initial data, and (iii) the scales of bubbles are asymptotically given by a universal sequence of rates up to scaling symmetry. In parallel, we also obtain a complete classification of $\dot{H}^{1}$-bounded radial solutions to (NLH) in dimensions $N\geq7$, building upon soliton resolution for such solutions. To our knowledge, this provides the first rigorous classification of bubble tree dynamics within symmetry. We introduce a new approach based on the energy method that does not rely on maximum principle. The key ingredient of the proof is a monotonicity estimate near any bubble tree configurations, which in turn requires a delicate construction of modified multi-bubble profiles also.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the first existence result of weak solutions to the 3D Euler equation with initial vorticity concentrated in a circle and velocity field in $C([0,T],L^{2^-})$. The energy becomes finite and decreasing for positive times, with vorticity concentrated in a ring that thickens and moves in the direction of the symmetry axis. With our approach, there is no need to mollify the initial data or to rescale the time variable. We overcome the singularity of the initial data by applying convex integration within the appropriate time-weighted space.</description>

      <title>A first passage model of intravitreal drug delivery and residence time, in relation to ocular geometry, individual variability, and injection location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Standard of care for various retinal diseases involves recurrent intravitreal injections. This motivates mathematical modelling efforts to identify influential factors for drug residence time, aiming to minimise administration frequency. We sought to describe the vitreal diffusion of therapeutics in nonclinical species used during drug development assessments. In human eyes, we investigated the impact of variability in vitreous cavity size and eccentricity, and in injection location, on drug elimination.
  Methods: Using a first passage time approach, we modelled the transport-controlled distribution of two standard therapeutic protein formats (Fab and IgG) and elimination through anterior and posterior pathways. Detailed anatomical 3D geometries of mouse, rat, rabbit, cynomolgus monkey, and human eyes were constructed using ocular images and biometry datasets. A scaling relationship was derived for comparison with experimental ocular half-lives.
  Results: Model simulations revealed a dependence of residence time on ocular size and injection location. Delivery to the posterior vitreous resulted in increased vitreal half-life and retinal permeation. Interindividual variability in human eyes had a significant influence on residence time (half-life range of 5-7 days), showing a strong correlation to axial length and vitreal volume. Anterior exit was the predominant route of drug elimination. Contribution of the posterior pathway displayed a small (3%) difference between protein formats, but varied between species (10-30%).
  Conclusions: The modelling results suggest that experimental variability in ocular half-life is partially attributed to anatomical differences and injection site location. Simulations further suggest a potential role of the posterior pathway permeability in determining species differences in ocular pharmacokinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove new results on the validity of the limiting amplitude principle (LAP) for the wave equation with nonconstant coefficients, not necessarily in divergence form. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and on the source term, we establish the LAP for space dimensions 2 and 3. This result is extended to one space dimension with an appropriate modification. We also quantify the LAP and thus provide estimates for the convergence of the time-domain solution to the frequency-domain solution. Our proofs are based on time-decay results of solutions of some auxiliary problems. The obtained results are illustrated numerically on radially symmetric problems in dimensions 1, 2 and 3.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies traveling waves with nonzero wave speed (angular traveling waves) of the high-dimensional Boussinesq equation that have not been studied before. We analyze the properties of these waves and demonstrate that, unlike the unique stationary solution, they lack positivity, radial symmetry, and exponential decay. By employing variational and geometric approaches, along with perturbation theory, we establish the orbital (in)stability and strong instability of these traveling waves.</description>

      <title>Subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity in a two-dimensional finitely long curved nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence and uniqueness of subsonic flows with a contact discontinuity in a two-dimensional finitely long slightly curved nozzle by prescribing the entropy, the Bernoulli's quantity and the horizontal mass flux distribution at the entrance and the flow angle at the exit. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system with a free boundary. The Lagrangian transformation is employed to straighten the contact discontinuity and the Euler system is reduced to a second-order nonlinear elliptic equation for the stream function. One of the key points in the analysis is to solve the associated linearized elliptic boundary value problem with mixed boundary conditions in a weighted H\"{o}lder space. Another one is to employ the implicit function theorem to locate the contact discontinuity.</description>

      <title>The Neumann sieve problem revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a domain, $\Gamma$ be a hyperplane intersecting it. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and $\Omega_\varepsilon=\Omega\setminus\overline{\Sigma_\varepsilon}$, where $\Sigma_\varepsilon$ ("sieve") is an $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $\Gamma$ punctured by many narrow passages. When $\varepsilon\to0$, the number of passages tends to infinity, while the diameters of their cross-sections tend to zero. For the case of identical straight periodically distributed and appropriately scaled passages T. Del Vecchio (1987) proved that the Neumann Laplacian on $\Omega_\varepsilon$ converges in a strong resolvent sense to the Laplacian on $\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ subject to the so-called $\delta'$-conditions on $\Gamma$. We will refine this result by deriving estimates on the rate of convergence in terms of various operator norms, and providing the estimate for the distance between the spectra. The assumptions we impose on the passages are rather general. For $n=2$ the results of T. Del Vecchio are not complete, some cases remain as open problems, and in this work we will fill these gaps.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distributed Control for a Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy System with Mass Sources, Unmatched Viscosities and Singular Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Cahn-Hilliard-Darcy system with mass sources, which can be considered as a basic, though simplified, diffuse interface model for the evolution of tumor growth. This system is equipped with an impermeability condition for the (volume) averaged velocity $\mathbf{u}$ as well as homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase function $\varphi$ and the chemical potential $\mu$. The source term in the convective Cahn-Hilliard equation contains a control $R$ that can be thought, for instance, as a drug or a nutrient in applications. Our goal is to study a distributed optimal control problem in the two dimensional setting with a cost functional of tracking-type. In the physically relevant case with unmatched viscosities for the binary fluid mixtures and a singular potential, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution with $\varphi$ being strictly separated from the pure phases $\pm 1$. This well-posedness result enables us to characterize the control-to-state mapping $\mathcal{S}:R \mapsto \varphi$. Then we obtain the existence of an optimal control, the Fr\'{e}chet differentiability of $\mathcal{S}$ and first-order necessary optimality conditions expressed through a suitable variational inequality for the adjoint variables. Finally, we prove the differentiability of the control-to-costate operator and establish a second-order sufficient condition for the strict local optimality.</description>
