      <title>The recurrence of groups inhibits the information spreading under higher-order interactions</title>

Abstract: Modeling social systems as networks based on pairwise interactions between individuals offers valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. However, the majority of social interactions occur within groups of individuals, characterized by higher-order structures. The mechanisms driving group formation and the impact of higher-order interactions, which arise from group dynamics, on information spreading in face-to-face interaction networks remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we examine some representative human face-to-face interaction data and find the recurrent patterns of groups. Moreover, we extend the force-directed motion (FDM) model with the forces derived from similarity distances within a hidden space to reproduce the recurrent group patterns and many key properties of face-to-face interaction networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the FDM model effectively predicts information-spreading behaviors under higher-order interactions. Finally, our results reveal that the recurrence of triangular groups inhibits the spread of information in face-to-face interaction networks, and the higher-order interactions will make this phenomenon more pronounced. These findings represent a significant advancement in the understanding of group formation and may open new avenues for research into the effects of group interactions on information propagation processes.</description>

      <title>Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>
