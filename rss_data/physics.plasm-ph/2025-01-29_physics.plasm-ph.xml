      <title>A Flow-Based Hybrid Approach for Kinetic Plasma Simulations: Bridging Direct Vlasov and Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel flow-based kinetic approach, inspired by continuous normalizing flows, for plasma simulation that unifies the complementary strengths of direct Vlasov solvers and particle-based methods. By tracking the distribution function along the characteristic curves defined by the Newton--Lorentz equations, our method directly computes f(z(t)) at selected points in phase space without reliance on Monte Carlo sampling.
  We employ a scatter-point integration scheme using smoothing kernels reminiscent of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), to calculate field quantities and moments, achieving higher accuracy with far fewer markers compared to Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods.
  Unlike PIC, our approach supports strategic marker placement and dynamic refinement in regions of interest, thus reducing sampling noise and computational overhead. This capability is particularly advantageous in high-density plasmas, where PIC's particle requirements can be prohibitive. In addition, the method naturally accommodates collisional effects via an augmented phase-space flow description ensuring robust handling of both collisionless and collisional plasmas.
  Our simulations of Landau damping, two-stream instability, and collisional relaxation demonstrate reduced noise, accurate phase-space resolution with significantly fewer markers, and robust energy conservation. Moreover, the independent characteristic curves and local scatter integration are highly amenable to GPU acceleration, enabling efficient large-scale simulations.
  Overall, this flow-based framework offers a powerful, flexible, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional particle methods for kinetic plasma dynamics, with potential applications spanning inertial confinement, Zpinch, and other complex kinetic systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Driven Bulk-Edge Correspondence in Electron Magnetofluids at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework connecting the pseudo-Chern number in momentum space to the spectral flow index in phase space for continuous media, with specific applications to topological Langmuir-cyclotron waves (TLCWs) in magnetized plasmas at uniform finite temperatures. By deriving a rigorous correspondence between these two topological invariants, we provide a solid justification for previous studies that applied this relationship heuristically across various continuous media. For magnetized plasmas with finite-temperature effects, we confirm the existence of TLCWs through numerical computation of bulk Chern number differences and analytical calculation of the spectral flow index. These findings advance the understanding of topological phenomena in continuous media.</description>

      <title>Shake-off in XFEL heated solid density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In atoms undergoing ionisation, an abrupt re-arrangement of free and bound electrons can lead to the ejection of another bound electron (shake-off). The spectroscopic signatures of shake-off have been predicted and observed in atoms and solids. Here, we present the first observation of this process in a solid-density plasma heated by an x-ray free electron laser. The results show that shake-off of L-shell electrons persists up to temperatures of 10 eV at solid density, and follow the probability predicted for solids. This work shows that shake-off should be included in plasma models for the correct interpretation of emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Relaxation pathways in X-ray Free Electron Laser heated Iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal photo-ionized plasmas are now established in the laboratory, and require models that treat the atomic processes and electron distribution self-consistently. We investigate the effects of inelastic thermalization in iron under intense X-ray irradiation using the atomic model BigBarT, suited for the self-consistent evolution of the electron continuum, including degeneracy effects. Our study focuses particularly on collisional $M$-shell ionization, which we identify as the dominant relaxation process of the non-thermal electrons. We show that $M$-shell satellite intensities are sensitive to non-thermal ionization, providing a potential method to refine collisional cross sections that are otherwise difficult to compute due to their proximity to the continuum and the associated plasma screening effects.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>FEQIS: A free-boundary equilibrium solver for integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new axisymmetric equilibrium solver has been written, called FEQIS (Flexible EQuIlibrium Solver), which purpose is to be used inside integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas. The FEQIS code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and the "circuit" equations for the external coils and passive conducting structures that are toroidally connected. The code has been specifically equipped with flexibility in choice of circuit connections, and a stripped-down numerical scheme for the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation through a structure of multi-level simplifications which can be tested against the required accuracy.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissipative anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic System Conceptual Design for a Negative Triangularity Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative triangularity (NT) tokamak configurations have several key benefits including sufficient core confinement, improved power handling, and reduced edge pressure gradients that allow for edge-localized mode (ELM) free operation. We present the design of a compact NT device for testing sophisticated simulation and control software, with the aim of demonstrating NT controllability and informing power plant operation. The TokaMaker code is used to develop the basic electromagnetic system of the $R_0$ = 1 m, $a$ = 0.27 m, $B_t$ = 3 T, $I_p$ = 0.75 MA tokamak. The proposed design utilizes eight poloidal field coils with maximum currents of 1 MA to achieve a wide range of plasma geometries with $-0.7 &lt; \delta &lt; -0.3$ and $1.5 &lt; \kappa &lt; 1.9$. Scenarios with strong negative triangularity and high elongation are particularly susceptible to vertical instability, necessitating the inclusion of high-field side and/or low-field side passive stabilizing plates which together reduce vertical instability growth rates by $\approx$75%. Upper limits for the forces on poloidal and toroidal field coils are predicted and mechanical loads on passive structures during current quench events are assessed. The 3 T on-axis toroidal field is achieved with 16 demountable copper toroidal field coils, allowing for easy maintenance of the vacuum vessel and poloidal field coils. This pre-conceptual design study demonstrates that the key capabilities required of a dedicated NT tokamak experiment can be realized with existing copper magnet technologies.</description>
