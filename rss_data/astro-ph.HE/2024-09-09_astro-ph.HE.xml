      <title>Chandra Discovery of a Candidate Hyper-Luminous X-ray Source in MCG+11-11-032</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of MCG+11-11-032, a nearby AGN with the unique classification of both a binary and a dual AGN candidate. With new Chandra observations we aim to resolve any dual AGN system via imaging data, and search for signs of a binary AGN via analysis of the X-ray spectrum. Analyzing the Chandra spectrum, we find no evidence of previously suggested double-peaked Fe K$\alpha$ lines; the spectrum is instead best fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a single Fe K$\alpha$ line, as well as an additional line centered at $\approx$7.5 keV. The Chandra observation reveals faint, soft, and extended X-ray emission, possibly linked to low-level nuclear outflows. Further analysis shows evidence for a compact, hard source -- MCG+11-11-032 X2 -- located 3.27'' from the primary AGN. Modeling MCG+11-11-032 X2 as a compact source, we find that it is relatively luminous ($L_{\text{2$-$10 keV}} = 1.52_{-0.48}^{+0.96}\times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and the location is coincident with an compact and off-nuclear source resolved in Hubble Space Telescope infrared (F105W) and ultraviolet (F621M, F547M) bands. Pairing our X-ray results with a 144 MHz radio detection at the host galaxy location, we observe X-ray and radio properties similar to those of ESO 243-49 HLX-1, suggesting that MCG+11-11-032 X2 may be a hyper-luminous X-ray source. This detection with Chandra highlights the importance of a high-resolution X-ray imager, and how previous binary AGN candidates detected with large-aperture instruments benefit from high-resolution follow-up. Future spatially resolved optical spectra, and deeper X-ray observations, can better constrain the origin of MCG+11-11-032 X2.</description>

      <title>Propagation of strong electromagnetic waves in tenuous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in tenuous plasmas, where the wave frequency, $\omega_0$, is much larger than the plasma frequency, $\omega_{\rm P}$. We show that in pair plasmas nonlinear effects are weak for $a_0 \ll \omega_0/\omega_{\rm P}$, where $a_0$ is the wave strength parameter. In electron-proton plasmas a more restrictive condition must be satisfied, namely either $a_0\ll 1/\omega_{\rm P}\tau_0$, where $\tau_0$ is the duration of the radiation pulse, or $a_0\ll 1$. We derive the equations that govern the evolution of the pulse in the weakly nonlinear regime. Our results have important implications for the modeling of fast radio bursts. We argue that: (i) Millisecond duration bursts with a smooth profile must be produced in a proton-free environment, where nonlinear effects are weaker. (ii) Propagation through an electron-proton plasma near the source can imprint a sub-microsecond variability on the burst profile.</description>

      <title>Multi-epoch leptohadronic modeling of neutrino source candidate blazar PKS 0735+178</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube remains largely unknown. Several individual neutrino source candidates were observed. Among them is the gamma-ray flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. A similar coincidence of a high-energy neutrino and a gamma-ray flare was found in blazar PKS 0735+178. By modeling the spectral energy distributions of PKS 0735+178, we expect to investigate the physical conditions for neutrino production during different stages of the source activity. We analyze the multi-wavelength data during the selected periods of time. Using numerical simulations of radiation processes in the source, we study the parameter space of one-zone leptonic and leptohadronic models and find the best-fit solutions that explain the observed photon fluxes. We show the impact of model parameter degeneracy on the prediction of the neutrino spectra. We show that the available mutli-wavelength data are not sufficient to predict the neutrino spectrum unambiguously. Still, under the condition of maximal neutrino flux, we propose a scenario in which 0.2 neutrino events are produced during the 50 days flare.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: The diversity and relative rates of the thermonuclear SN population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility SN Ia Data Release 2 (ZTF SN Ia DR2) contains more than 3,000 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), providing the largest homogeneous low-redshift sample of SNe Ia. Having at least one spectrum per event, this data collection is ideal for large-scale statistical studies of the photometric, spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties of SNe Ia, particularly of the more rare "peculiar" subclasses. In this paper, we first present the method we developed to spectroscopically classify the SNe in the sample, and the techniques we used to model their multi-band light curves and explore their photometric properties. We then show a method to distinguish between the "peculiar" subtypes and the normal SNe Ia. We also explore the properties of their host galaxies and estimate their relative rates, focusing on the "peculiar" subtypes and their connection to the cosmologically useful SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study with respect to the progenitor systems of the "peculiar" SN Ia events.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-state prediction for fast flavor transformation in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling in shell model turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shell model turbulence is a simplified mathematical framework that captures essential features of incompressible fluid turbulence such as the energy cascade, intermittency and anomalous scaling of the fluid observables. We perform a precision analysis of shell model of a complex velocity field in the steady state turbulent regime, including a calculation of the leading hundred anomalous scaling exponents, the probability distribution function of the magnitude and phase of the velocity and the correlations among them at different shells. We analyze the tail of velocity distribution function and find that the high moments exhibit a linear scaling that differs from Kolomogorov's. We explain the origin of this asymptotic scaling that offers a new insight to the structure of fluid turbulence.</description>

      <title>BH-BH mergers with &amp; without EM counterpart: A model for stable tertiary mass transfer in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple stars are prevalent within the population of observed stars. Their evolution, compared to binaries, is notably more complex, influenced by unique dynamical, tidal, and mass transfer processes. Understanding these phenomena is essential for a comprehensive insight into multistar evolution and the formation of energetic transients, including gravitational-wave mergers. Our study probes the evolution of triple star systems when the tertiary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the inner binary, potentially forming GW sources with distinct properties. We develop an analytical model for hierarchical triples undergoing stable mass transfer from the tertiary. Using population synthesis simulations, we investigate triples with a Roche-lobe filling tertiary and an inner binary black hole. These systems originate from inner binaries undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution. Our analysis includes populations with metallicities of Z=0.005 and Z=0.0005, focusing on primary components with initial masses of 20 to 100 M_sun, and inner and outer orbital separations up to 40 R_sun and 10^5 R_sun, respectively. Our results show that mass transfer predominantly leads to orbital shrinkage of the inner binary, non-zero eccentricities, and expansion of the outer orbit. Among systems with CHE inner binaries, 9.5% result in mass transfer from the tertiary onto an inner BBH. We predict high formation efficiency of GW mergers, ranging from 85.1% to 100% at Z=0.005 and 100% at Z=0.0005, with short delay times. Local merger rates are projected to be between 0.69 to 1.74 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. A fraction of these BBH mergers, entering the LISA and aLIGO frequency bands, may still be accreting gas, potentially producing a strong electromagnetic counterpart. EM signals vary significantly based on model assumptions, ranging from less than 0.03% to 46.8% of all mergers if circumbinary disk formation is allowed.</description>

      <title>Are BAL outflows powered by radiation pressure on dust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) outflows are commonly detected in active galactic nuclei (AGN), but their driving mechanism remains poorly constrained. Here we investigate whether radiation pressure on dust can adequately explain the BAL phenomenon observed in quasars. In the framework of our AGN radiative dusty feedback scenario, we show that dust-driven outflows can reach BAL wind-like velocities ($v \sim 10^4$ km/s) on galactic scales ($r \lesssim 1$ kpc). This is consistent with recent observations indicating that BAL acceleration typically occurs on scales of $\sim 10$ pc, and that the majority of BAL outflows are located at galactocentric radii greater than $\sim 100$ pc. We derive the outflow radial velocity profile and compute the associated outflow momentum rate and kinetic power, which are found to be in agreement with the outflow energetics measured in BAL quasars. Therefore radiation pressure on dust may account for the observed BAL outflow dynamics and energetics. Furthermore, we consider BAL clouds/clumps (leading to a clumpy BAL flow characterised by a wide range of outflowing velocities), and we analyse how the resulting covering factors affect the shape of the absorption line profiles. We conclude that dust-driven BAL outflows may provide a significant contribution to AGN feedback on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Progress towards an array-wide diffuse UHE neutrino search with the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino experiment at the South Pole. ARA aims to detect the radio emissions from neutrino-induced particle showers using in-ice clusters of antennas buried ${\sim}200$ m deep on a roughly cubical lattice with side length of ${\sim}10$ m. ARA has five such independent stations which have collectively accumulated ${\sim}30$ station-years of livetime through 2023. The fifth station of ARA has an additional sub-detector, known as the phased array, which pioneered an interferometric trigger constructed by beamforming the signals of $7$ tightly packed, vertically-polarized antennas. This scheme has been demonstrated to significantly improve the trigger efficiency for low SNR signals. In this talk, we will present the current state of the first array-wide diffuse neutrino search using $24$ station-years of data (through 2021). We anticipate that this analysis will result in the first UHE neutrino observation or world-leading limits from a radio neutrino detector below $100$ EeV. Additionally, this analysis will demonstrate the feasibility for multi-station in-ice radio arrays to successfully conduct an array-wide neutrino search -- paving the way for future, large detector arrays such as RNO-G and IceCube-Gen2 Radio.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of charged fluid around a Kerr black hole immersed in a magnetic field: variation of angular momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work presents analytically constructed equilibrium structures of charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr Black holes embedded in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. Our focus is on the effect of the non-constant angular momentum distribution through the disk, as well as its combined effect with the external magnetic field and the fluid charge. We demonstrate that the three parameters of our study have a significant impact on the various features of the accretion disk: the shape, the size of the disk and the characteristic of the fluid, as the pressure and the rest-mass density. Through our investigation, we observe substantial deviations from both the uncharged thick disk model and the charged disk model with constant angular momentum.</description>

      <title>{\tt{CLOWN}}: The PASO cloud detection for optimization of automatic optical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbiting space objects have become in the last decade a major nuisance impacting ground astronomy and orbiting space assets, from observatories to satellites and space stations. In particular with the rise of the satellite population in Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), space objects are becoming an even bigger threat and a strong problem to astronomical observations. To tackle these threats several coordinated surveillance networks composed of dedicated sensors (telescopes, radars and laser ranging facilities) track and survey space objects, from debris to active satellites. As part of the European Space Surveillance \&amp; Tracking (EU-SST) network, Portugal is developing the PAmpilhosa da Serra Space Observatory (PASO), with both radio and optical telescopes dedicated to the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) domain, deployed at a Dark Sky destination. To optimize telescope survey time, we developed {\tt{CLOWN}} (CLOud Watcher at Night), an application interface that automatically monitors clouds in real time. This software can correctly trace clouds positions in the sky, provides accurate pointing information to the observation planning of the optical telescope to avoid cloudy areas. {\tt{CLOWN}} only requires the use of an all-sky camera, which is already a norm in observatories with optical telescopes and can be used with any camera, including those for which no information about its model specification do exist. {\tt{CLOWN}} does not require great computing power and it does not require the installation of additional equipment. {\tt{CLOWN}} results are very promising and confirm that the app can correctly identify clouds in a variety of different conditions and cloud types.</description>

This release, named the "DR2", contains 3628 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) SNe Ia discovered, followed and classified by the Zwicky Transient Facility survey between March 2018 and December 2020. Of these, 3000 have good-to-excellent sampling and 2667 pass standard cosmology light-curve quality cuts. This release is thus the largest SN Ia release to date, increasing by an order of magnitude the number of well characterized low-redshift objects. With the "DR2", we also provide a volume-limited (z &lt; 0.06) sample of nearly a thousand SNe Ia. With such a large, homogeneous and well controlled dataset, we are studying key current questions on SN cosmology, such as the linearity SNe Ia standardization, the SN and host dependencies, the diversity of the SN Ia population, and the accuracy of the current light-curve modeling. These, and more, are studied in detail in a series of articles associated with this release. Alongside the SN Ia parameters, we publish our force-photometry gri-band light curves, 5138 spectra, local and global host properties, observing logs, and a python tool to ease use and access of these data. The photometric accuracy of the "DR2" is not yet suited for cosmological parameter inference, which will follow as "DR2.5" release. We nonetheless demonstrate that the multi-thousand SN Ia Hubble Diagram has a typical 0.15 mag scatter.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Muons in Binary Neutron Star Mergers: First Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muon-driven neutrino reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation timespan and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modelling of such systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensionality of three-dimensional, magnetically dominated, decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is important in various astrophysical contexts, including early universe magnetic fields, star formation, turbulence in galaxy clusters, magnetospheres and solar corona. Previously known in the nonhelical case of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence, we show that magnetic reconnection is important also in the fully helical case and is likely the agent responsible for the inverse transfer of energy. Again, in the fully helical case, we find that there is a similarity in power law decay exponents in both 2.5D and 3D simulations. To understand this intriguing similarity, we investigate the possible quasi-two-dimensionalization of the 3D system. We perform Minkowski functional analysis and find that the characteristic length scales of a typical magnetic structure in the system are widely different, suggesting the existence of local anisotropies. Finally, we provide a quasi-two-dimensional hierarchical merger model which recovers the relevant power law scalings. In the nonhelical case, we show that a helicity-based invariant cannot constrain the system, and the best candidate is still anastrophy or vector potential squared, which is consistent with the quasi-two-dimensionalization of the system.</description>

      <title>Favorable conditions for heavy element nucleosynthesis in rotating proto-magnetar winds</title>

Abstract: The neutrino-driven wind cooling phase of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) follows successful supernovae. Wind models without magnetic fields or rotation fail to achieve the necessary conditions for production of the third $r-$process peak, but robustly produce a weak $r-$process in neutron-rich winds. Using 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations with magnetar-strength magnetic fields and rotation, we show that the PNS rotation rate significantly affects the thermodynamic conditions of the wind. We show that high entropy material is quasi-periodically ejected from the closed zone of the PNS magnetosphere with the required thermodynamic conditions to produce heavy elements. We show that maximum entropy $S$ of the material ejected depends systematically on the magnetar spin period $P_{\star}$ and scales as $S \propto P_{\star}^{-5/6}$ for sufficiently rapid rotation. We present results from simulations at a constant neutrino luminosity representative of $\sim 1-2$ s after the onset of cooling for $P_{\star}$ ranging from 5 ms to 200 ms and a few simulations with evolving neutrino luminosity where we follow the evolution of the magnetar wind until $10-14$ s after the onset of cooling. We estimate at magnetar polar magnetic field strength $B_0=3\times 10^{15}$ G and $10^{15}$ G that neutron-rich magnetar winds can respectively produce at least $\sim 1-5\times 10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim 1-4\times 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ of material with the required parameters for synthesis of the third $r-$process peak, within $1-2$ s and 10 s respectively in that order after the onset of cooling. We show that proton-rich magnetar winds can have favorable conditions for production of $p-$nuclei, even at a modest $B_0=5\times 10^{14}$ G.</description>

      <title>Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions -- II: population analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. Though the debates on the origin of QPEs have not completely settled down, more and more analyses favor the interpretation that QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. If this interpretation is correct, QPEs will be invaluable in probing the orbits of stellar mass objects in the vicinity of SMBHs, and further inferring the formation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), one of the major targets of spaceborne gravitational wave missions. In this work, we extended the EMRI orbital analysis in Paper I arXiv:2401.11190 to all the known QPE sources with more than $6$ flares observed. Among all the analyzed 5 QPE sources, two distinct EMRI populations are identified: 4 EMRIs are of low orbital eccentricity (consistent with 0) which should be born in the wet EMRI formation channel, and 1 mildly eccentric EMRI (with $e= 0.25^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ at 2-$\sigma$ confidence level) is consistent with the predictions of both the dry loss-cone formation channel and the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Galactic population of axion clouds around stellar-origin black holes: Gravitational wave signals in the 10-100 kHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar fields can experience runaway `superradiant' amplification near spinning black holes, resulting in a macroscopic `axion cloud' which slowly dissipates via continuous monochromatic gravitational waves. For a particular range of boson masses, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ -- $10^{-10})$ eV, an axion cloud will radiate in the $10$ -- $100$ kHz band of the Levitated Sensor Detector (LSD). Using fiducial models of the mass, spin, and age distributions of stellar-origin black holes, we simulate the present-day Milky Way population of these hypothetical objects. As a first step towards assessing the LSD's sensitivity to the resultant ensemble of GW signals, we compute the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios which build up over a nominal integration time of $10^{7}$ s, assuming the projected sensitivity of the $1$-m LSD prototype currently under construction, as well as for future $10$-m and $100$-m concepts. For a $100$-m cryogenic instrument, hundreds of resolvable signals could be expected if the boson mass $\mu$ is around $3\times10^{-11}$ eV, and this number diminishes with increasing $\mu$ up to $\approx 5.5\times10^{-11}$ eV. The much larger population of unresolved sources will produce a confusion foreground which could be detectable by a $10$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-4.5)\times10^{-11}$ eV, or by a $100$-m instrument if $\mu \in (3-6)\times10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in NGC 1399 using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the detectability of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within the mass range $10^2-10^5$ solar masses in the globular star clusters of NGC 1399 at a frequency of 300.00 MHz. Employing the theoretical Bondi accretion model and the empirical fundamental plane of black hole accretion, we estimate IMBH masses based on bolometric luminosity and X-ray/radio luminosities, respectively. By simulating a 3-hour observation of 77 globular cluster candidates using the Square Kilometer Array, we identify radio detection benchmarks indicative of accretion onto IMBHs. Our results show that IMBHs inside the globular star clusters located in NGC 1399 are indeed detectable, with the Bondi accretion model providing IMBH mass estimates ranging from $2.93 \times 10^{3.0\pm 0.39}$ to $7.43 \times 10^{4.0 \pm 0.39}$ solar masses, and the empirical fundamental-plane relation suggesting IMBH mass estimation with $3.41\times 10^{5.0 \pm 0.96}$ solar masses. These findings highlight the presence and detectability of IMBHs in globular clusters, offering insights into their role as precursors to supermassive black holes and enriching our understanding of black hole formation and evolution in astrophysical environments.</description>
