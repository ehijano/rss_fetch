      <title>Twisting Kelvin Cells for Enhanced Vibration Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the propagation of elastic waves in periodic Kelvin-cell chains, focusing on symmetry-breaking geometric modifications induced by twisting the cell's faces. By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices.</description>

      <title>Engineering Spatial Dispersion to Synthesize Arbitrary Spatial Filters Based on Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a design framework for synthesizing angularly selective spatial filters using non-uniform metagratings. While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Dual-Band Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Precise Full-Space Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonlocal, dual-band reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for full-space beam synthesis at 4.0 GHz and 6.3 GHz. The constituent unit cells comprise a pair of interleaved sub-cells that are specifically engineered to operate independently at their respective target frequencies. This hardware-level decoupling facilitates an efficient synthesis framework based on microwave network theory (MNT) that rigorously accounts for mutual coupling within both bands. Under this framework, the optimal biasing for sub-cells is determined to achieve precise full-space beam synthesis at both frequencies. The proposed method is numerically and experimentally validated with an RIS comprising 14 X 14 varactor-loaded unit cells that can be individually biased. We experimentally demonstrate arbitrary beam profile synthesis beyond simple beam steering, including dual-beam and sector patterns in full space. Experimental and simulation results show good agreement with the MNT model, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Behavior of Non-spherical Particles in Confined Vertical Flows: A Resolved CFD-DEM Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sedimentation and vertical hydraulic transport of irregular polymetallic nodules (PMNs) using resolved CFD-DEM with multisphere particles spanning $100 &lt; Re_p &lt; 3000$. Shape effects induce 2.0-2.3 times drag enhancement relative to volume-equivalent spheres, arising from 50\% larger frontal areas and wake asymmetry, reducing terminal velocities by 29-33\%. Vertical transport exhibits velocity-driven transitions from intermittent settling to stable convection, as demonstrated by residence-time and drag-force statistics. While PMNs exhibit enhanced rotational-translational coupling and broader force fluctuations, the regime progression qualitatively resembles that of volume-equivalent spherical particles. Drag variance evolution reveals contrasting behavior: small particles $(d/D=0.082)$ show narrow distributions and wake suppression at higher velocities, while large particles $(d/D=0.22)$ exhibit non-monotonic variance. These findings elucidate shape-confinement interactions in vertical transport and establish bounds on the applicability of volume-equivalent spherical particles in reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>Electrically pumped AlGaN edge-emitting UV-B laser diodes grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid and deep ultraviolet (UV) laser diodes remain among the least explored devices in semiconductor optoelectronics, despite their importance for spectroscopy, biochemical sensing, disinfection, and emerging quantum photonics. Here, we demonstrate an electrically pumped AlGaN-based laser diode operating in the UV-B band (280-315 nm). The device is grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on single-crystal AlN substrate and fabricated in a ridge-waveguide geometry. The laser diode operates at 298.5 nm and exhibits a relatively low threshold current density of 3.4 kA/cm$^2$. Clear nonlinear light-current characteristics and pronounced spectral narrowing with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.2 nm are measured above threshold.</description>

      <title>Learned split-spectrum metalens for obstruction-free broadband imaging in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstructions such as raindrops, fences, or dust degrade captured images, especially when mechanical cleaning is infeasible. Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Tailoring Heat Transport via Iris-Gated Core-Double-Shell Nanoparticles in the Context of Photothermal Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rational design of Janus nanostructures that combine efficient optical absorption with controlled thermal transport is essential for advancing plasmonic photothermal therapies and related applications. Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework to investigate core-double-shell nanoparticles and their asymmetric version, the iris-gated core-double-shell architecture. The optical response of the structures is first evaluated using generalized Mie theory and subsequently validated through FEM and FDTD simulations, ensuring a consistent description of their electromagnetic and thermal behavior. To systematically map the space of variables, we defined a multi-objective figure of merit that integrates absorption efficiency, absorption cross section, and polymer-layer thickness. Furthermore, we define a thermal gain parameter that quantifies energy densification and complements the analysis of thermal directionality. Our results reveal a near-optimal configuration with parameters ($r_c$, $\delta_{Au}$, $\delta_p$, $\theta$)=(36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70$\deg$), capable of producing a temperature rise of 20-23 $\deg$C, with 67% of the thermal fluz directed toward the upper hemispace and yielding 50% focusing enhancement relative to the symmetric case. This design preserves geometric simplicity and high symmetry while delivering robust thermal asymmetry, thereby facilitating experimental implementation. Beyond photothermal therapies, the proposed methodology constitutes a versatile platform for the rapid screening and optimization of layered nanostructures, adaptable to diverse materials, excitation wavelengths, and functional objectives in nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Optimally Driven Dressed Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.</description>
