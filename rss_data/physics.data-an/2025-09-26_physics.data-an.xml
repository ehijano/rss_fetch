      <title>Data-driven modeling of wind farm wake flow based on multi-scale feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, efficient prediction of wind flow with wake effects is crucial for wind-farm layout and power forecasting. Existing approaches-physical measurements, numerical simulations, physics-based models, and data-driven models-face trade-offs: the first two are time- and resource-intensive; physics-based models can lack accuracy due to limited physics; data-driven methods leverage abundant, high-quality data and are increasingly popular. We propose a rapid, data-driven wake-flow model inspired by video-frame interpolation and the principle of similarity. Field data are transformed into images; multi-scale feature recognition then identifies, matches, and interpolates wake structures using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to generate intermediate flow fields. Six representative mini wind-farm cases validate the approach, spanning variations in turbine spacing, turbine size, combined spacing-size variations, different turbine counts, and wind-direction misalignment. Across cases, the method achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.68-2.28%. Because it flexibly computes both 2D and 3D wake fields, the method offers substantial computational-efficiency gains over large-eddy simulation (LES) and Meteodyn WT when 2D accuracy suffices for industrial needs. Accordingly, it provides a practical alternative to measurements, high-fidelity simulations, and simplified physics-based models, enabling efficient expansion of wake-flow databases for wind-farm design and power prediction while balancing speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Peak separation methods for inverse photoelectron spectra: Comparing second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states, owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks. Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability. This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound: How close can we get without entangling measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-parameter quantum metrology, the resource of entanglement can lead to an increase in efficiency of the estimation process. Entanglement can be used in the state preparation stage, or the measurement stage, or both, to harness this advantage; here we focus on the role of entangling measurements. Specifically, entangling or collective measurements over multiple identical copies of a probe state are known to be superior to measuring each probe individually, but the extent of this improvement is an open problem. It is also known that such entangling measurements, though resource-intensive, are required to attain the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks. In this work we investigate the maximum precision improvement that collective quantum measurements can offer over individual measurements for estimating parameters of qudit states, calling this the 'collective quantum enhancement'. We show that, whereas the maximum enhancement can, in principle, be a factor of $n$ for estimating $n$ parameters, this bound is not tight for large $n$. Instead, our results prove an enhancement linear in dimension of the qudit is possible using collective measurements and lead us to conjecture that this is the maximum collective quantum enhancement in any local estimation scenario.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Summary Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</description>
