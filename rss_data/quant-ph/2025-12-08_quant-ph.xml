      <title>A Mutual Information-based Metric for Temporal Expressivity and Trainability Estimation in Quantum Policy Gradient Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various limitations of conventional supervised learning have been highlighted, leading to the emergence of reinforcement learning -- and, further, quantum reinforcement learning that exploits quantum resources such as entanglement and superposition -- as promising alternatives. Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated.</description>

      <title>From Kinematics to Interference: Operational Requirements for the Quantum Principle of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum principle of relativity (QPR) puts forward an ambitious idea: extend special relativity with a formally superluminal branch of Lorentz-type maps, and treat the resulting consistency constraints as hints about why quantum theory has the structure it does [1]. The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme.</description>

      <title>Quantum compilation framework for data loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient encoding of classical data into quantum circuits is a critical challenge that directly impacts the scalability of quantum algorithms. In this work, we present an automated compilation framework for resource-aware quantum data loading tailored to a given input vector and target error tolerance. By explicitly exploiting the trade-off between exact and approximate state preparation, our approach systematically partitions the total error budget between precision and approximation errors, thereby minimizing quantum resource costs. The framework supports a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art methods, including multiplexer-based loaders, quantum read-only memory (QROM) constructions, sparse encodings, matrix product states (MPS), Fourier series loaders (FSL), and Walsh transform-based diagonal operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across several applications, where it consistently uncovers non-obvious, resource-efficient strategies enabled by controlled approximation. In particular, we analyze a computational fluid dynamics workflow where the automated selection of MPS state preparation and Walsh transform-based encoding, combined with a novel Walsh-based measurement technique, leads to resource reductions of over four orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches. We also introduce two independent advances developed through the framework: a more efficient circuit for d-diagonal matrices, and an optimized block encoding for kinetic energy operators. Our results underscore the indispensable role of automated, approximation-aware compilation in making large-scale quantum algorithms feasible on resource-constrained hardware.</description>

      <title>The deep Hilbert space of all-to-all interacting SU(3) atoms: from quantum to classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in multilevel atoms with all-to-all interactions, inspired by cavity QED. Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument. Our work contributes to the study of the quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems, and uncovers a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models.</description>

      <title>Investigating a Quantum-Inspired Method for Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in quantum algorithms which measure and reuse qubits and in efficient classical simulation leveraging projective measurements, we extend these frameworks to real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems undergoing discrete-time and continuous-time Hamiltonian evolution, and find improvements that significantly reduce sampling overhead. The approach exploits causal light-cone structure by interleaving time and space evolution and applying projective measurements as soon as local subsystems reach the target physical time, suppressing entanglement growth. Comparing to time-evolving block decimation, the method reaches longer times per sample for the same resources. We also gain the ability to study dynamics of entanglement that would be occurring on quantum hardware when following similar protocols, such as the holographic quantum dynamics simulation framework. We show how to efficiently obtain local observables as well as equal-time and time-dependent correlation functions. Our findings show how optimizations for quantum hardware can benefit classical tensor network simulations and how such classical methods can yield insights into the utility of quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Multimode equilibrium approximations in light-matter systems from weak to strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we detail different approaches to treat multi-mode photonic environments within non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics in the long-wavelength approximation efficiently. Specifically we show that for equilibrium properties of coupled light-matter systems, we can approximately capture the effects of multi-mode photonic environments on matter systems by either only keeping the polarization part of the electric field in the length-gauge formulation or by a few effective modes. We present a comprehensive set of approximation methods designed to accurately capture equilibrium phenomena in quantum light-matter systems across a range of complex photonic environments, from weak to strong coupling. These methods are applied to atomic and molecular models as well as to a two-dimensional quantum ring, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and laying the groundwork for first-principles simulations of real materials in cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hardware-inspired Continuous Variables Quantum Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variables (CV) quantum optics is a natural formalism for neural networks (NNs) due to its ability to reproduce the information processing of such trainable interconnected systems. In quantum optics, Gaussian operators induce affine mappings on the quadratures of optical modes while non-Gaussian resources -- the challenging piece for physical implementation -- originate the nonlinear effects, unlocking quantum analogs of an artificial neuron. This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick--Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Experiments on supervised learning and state-preparation tasks show balanced-resource efficiency with strong expressivity and generalization capabilities, illustrating the potential of the architecture for scalable photonic quantum machine learning and for quantum applications such as complex non-Gaussian gate synthesis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend a previously presented Grover-based heuristic to tackle general combinatorial optimization problems with linear constraints. We further describe the introduced method as a framework that enables performance improvements through circuit optimization and machine learning techniques. Comparisons with state-of-the-art classical solvers further demonstrate the algorithm's potential to achieve a quantum advantage in terms of speed, given appropriate quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Quantum Simulations of Energy-Loss and Hadronization in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories: SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory in 1+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Analog quantum simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in a transmon qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of large-scale quantum systems is one of the most sought-after applications of quantum computers. Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Boosting Work Extraction in Quantum Batteries via Continuous Environment Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations that typically develop between a quantum battery and its charger reduce the amount of work extractable from the battery. We show that by coupling the system with an additional environment that can be continuously monitored, one can weaken these correlations and enhance work extraction beyond what is achievable in the ideal (closed system) limit. This general mechanism is illustrated using both a cavity-mediated spin-spin and Dicke quantum battery models.</description>

      <title>Real-time optimal quantum control for atomic magnetometers with decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium quantum field theory of the free-electron laser in Keldysh formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a non-equilibrium quantum field theory of the free-electron laser based on the Preparata model, using the real-time Keldysh formalism. Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients.</description>

      <title>Photoelectrical detection and characterization of divacancy and PL5-PL7 spins in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelectrical detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) offers a scalable alternative to optical readout of spin defects in semiconductors and is particularly promising for near-infrared (NIR) emitters, where photodetection is often challenging. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature coherent PDMR of PL3 (divacancy), PL5, PL6, and PL7 spins. PL7 and PL5 exhibit notably stronger PDMR than PL6 as opposed to optical detection, indicating higher ionization efficiency and suitability for electrical readout. Rabi oscillation and two-frequency spectroscopy reveal a previously undiscovered secondary resonance of PL7. We determine the zero-field splitting parameters of PL7 and assign the recently reported PL3a defect to PL7. The demonstrated PDMR of these NIR defects constitutes a key advancement toward quantum electronic devices. Also, the clarified spin parameters and ionization characteristics provide a solid foundation for advancing quantum technologies utilizing these defects regardless of the detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Highly resilient, error-protected quantum gates in a solid-state quantum network node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are a cornerstone of any quantum computing and communications architecture. Realizing such control in the presence of realistic errors at the level required for beyond-threshold quantum error correction is a long-standing challenge for all quantum hardware platforms. Here we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate error-protected quantum gates in a solid-state quantum network node. Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors. We introduce Power-Unaffected, Doubly-Detuning-Insensitive Gates (PUDDINGs) -- a theoretical framework for constructing conditional gates with immunity to both amplitude and frequency errors. For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction. These results present viable building blocks for a new class of fault-tolerant quantum networks and represent the first experimental realization of error-protected conditional gates in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Nb and Ta Pentoxide Loss Tangents for Superconducting Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits are commonly made with thin-film Nb wiring, but recent studies have shown increased performance with Ta wiring. In this work, we compare the resonator-induced single photon, millikelvin dielectric loss for pentoxides of Nb (Nb2O5) and Ta (Ta2O5) in order to further understand limiting losses in qubits. Nb and Ta pentoxides of three thicknesses are deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto identical coplanar waveguide resonators. The two-level system (TLS) loss in Nb2O5 is determined to be about 30% higher than that of Ta2O5. This work indicates that qubits with Nb wiring are affected by higher loss arising from the native pentoxide itself, likely in addition to the presence of suboxides, which are largely absent in Ta.</description>

      <title>Verifier-initiated quantum message-authentication via quantum zero-knowledge proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand authentication is critical for scalable quantum systems, yet current approaches require the signer to initiate communication, creating unnecessary overhead. We introduce a new method where the verifier can request authentication only when needed, improving efficiency for quantum networks and blockchain applications. Our approach adapts the concept of zero-knowledge proofs widely used in classical cryptography to quantum settings, ensuring that verification reveals nothing about secret keys. We develop a general framework that converts any suitable quantum proof into a verifier-driven signature protocol and present a concrete implementation based on quantum measurements. The protocol achieves strong security guarantees, including resistance to forgery and privacy against curious verifiers, without relying on computational hardness assumptions and with qubit technologies. This work delivers the first general verifier-initiated quantum signature scheme with formal security, paving the way for scalable, secure authentication in future quantum infrastructures and decentralized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the classical limit of a fairly general nonlinear semiclassical hybrid system within a MaxEnt framework. The consistency of the hybrid dynamics requires algebraic constraints on quantum operators and smoothness conditions for the classical variables. Analytically, we demonstrate that the classical limit is characterized by a pure density matrix representing a single state, which reproduces the dynamics of its classical analogue. To illustrate the methodology, we revisit and synthesize two previously studied examples.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Monte Carlo sampling for local observables in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.</description>

      <title>Shadow Tomography Against Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single-copy shadow tomography in the adversarial robust setting, where the goal is to learn the expectation values of $M$ observables $O_1, \ldots, O_M$ with $\varepsilon$ accuracy, but $\gamma$-fraction of the outcomes can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary. We show that all non-adaptive shadow tomography algorithms must incur an error of $\varepsilon=\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma\min\{\sqrt{M}, \sqrt{d}\})$ for some choice of observables, even with unlimited copies. Unfortunately, the classical shadows algorithm by [HKP20] and naive algorithms that directly measure each observable suffer even more. We design an algorithm that achieves an error of $\varepsilon=\tilde{O}(\gamma\max_{i\in[M]}\|O_i\|_{HS})$, which nearly matches our worst-case error lower bound for $M\ge d$ and guarantees better accuracy when the observables have stronger structure. Remarkably, the algorithm only needs $n=\frac{1}{\gamma^2}\log(M/\delta)$ copies to achieve that error with probability at least $1-\delta$, matching the sample complexity of the classical shadows algorithm that achieves the same error without corrupted measurement outcomes. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise. Finally, based on a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography, we prove that for rank $r$ states, both the near-optimal asymptotic error of $\varepsilon=\tilde{O}(\gamma\sqrt{r})$ and copy complexity $\tilde{O}(dr^2/\varepsilon^2)=\tilde{O}(dr/\gamma^2)$ can be achieved for adversarially robust state tomography, closing the large gap in [ABCL25] where optimal error can only be achieved using pseudo-polynomial number of copies in $d$.</description>

      <title>Mechanically mediated optical-microwave quantum state transfer by feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State transfer between light and microwaves is a key challenge in quantum networks. Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes.</description>

      <title>Observability Architecture for Quantum-Centric Supercomputing Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC) workflows often involve hybrid classical-quantum algorithms that are inherently probabilistic and executed on remote quantum hardware, making them difficult to interpret and limiting the ability to monitor runtime performance and behavior. The high cost of quantum circuit execution and large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure further restricts the number of feasible trials, making comprehensive evaluation of execution results essential for iterative development. We propose an observability architecture tailored for QCSC workflows that decouples telemetry collection from workload execution, enabling persistent monitoring across system and algorithmic layers and retaining detailed execution data for reproducible and retrospective analysis, eliminating redundant runs. Applied to a representative workflow involving sample-based quantum diagonalization, our system reveals solver behavior across multiple iterations. This approach enhances transparency and reproducibility in QCSC environments, supporting infrastructure-aware algorithm design and systematic experimentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretically secure communication against eavesdropping. However, phase instability remains a challenge across many QKD applications, particularly in schemes such as twin-field QKD and measurement-device-independent QKD. The most dominant source of phase fluctuation arises from the frequency offset between independent lasers. Here we propose a method to address this issue by employing a classical photodiode to compensate for the laser frequency difference. As an application of this method, we implement this technique in a mode-pairing QKD system, achieving an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassing the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km. This approach provides a practical solution for frequency matching between independent lasers and can be extended to other fields requiring precise phase stabilization.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two senders and one receiver multiparty communication scenario. Following Phys.Rev.A83, 062112 and arXiv : 2506.07699, we study multiparty communication bounded by dimension and distinguishability. We provide an explicit characterization of the classical correlations achievable under these constraints. We then demonstrate that quantum communication systematically exceeds these classical limits, even in the absence of preshared entanglement and without any input choice for the receiver. Furthermore, we implement semidefinite hierarchy tools tailored to the two-sender, one-receiver setting for both types of constraints considered. Our results reveal a clear quantum advantage in multiparty communication under those restrictions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Initial Point Smoothing and Control Approach to Quantum Memory Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a quantum memory system for storing quantum information in the form of its initial dynamic variables in the presence of environmental noise. In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase space quasi-probability functions provide powerful representations of quantum states and operators, as well as criteria for assessing quantum computational resources. In discrete, odd-dimensional systems (qudits), protocols involving only non-negative phase space distributions can be efficiently classically simulated. For bosonic systems, defined in continuous variables, phase space negativities are likewise necessary to prevent efficient classical simulation of the underlying physical processes. However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system. Finally, we provide computational and physical interpretations of the planar (quadrature-like) phase space limit, where genuinely quantum features may gradually vanish, yielding classically simulable behavior.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Classical Antiferromagnets into Quantum Spin Liquids via Global Cavity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.</description>

      <title>Randomness quantification in spontaneous emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence serves as a fundamental resource for generating intrinsic randomness, yet the quantification of randomness in quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on spontaneous emission has remained largely phenomenological. Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes.</description>

      <title>Exclusive Control of Quantum Memory Erasure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasing memory is a fundamental operational task in quantum information processing, governed by Landauer's principle, which links information loss to thermodynamic work. We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work.</description>

      <title>Lattice field theory for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.</description>

      <title>Continuous operations on non-Markovian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous measurements are central to quantum control and sensing, yet lack a model-independent operational description that can be applied to arbitrary non-Markovian processes without specifying a microscopic measurement model. Existing multi-time frameworks, such as process matrices, allow for an arbitrary sequence of operations to be applied on a general process, but are restricted to interventions at discrete times and cannot represent measurements of finite duration. We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations. This framework provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and leads to a natural definition of Markovianity in continuous time. We illustrate the formalism by analyzing continuous measurements in a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model, demonstrating its applicability to realistic non-Markovian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Coherent Control of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using a Broadband 3D Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in solid-state materials play a central role in determining coherence, stability, and performance in quantum technologies. Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dynamic systems at the nanometer scale can benefit from the loss and background resilience offered by quantum two-photon interference. However, fast measurements with the required resolution are difficult to realize. As a solution, we introduce extreme energy entanglement between the photons undergoing interference. Using a flux probing analysis technique, we recover vibrational signals with frequencies as high as 21 kHz. Along with validating nanometer-scale precision and accuracy, we observe a significant quantum advantage when measuring in the presence of loss and background.</description>

      <title>Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>Bridging quantum and classical computing for partial differential equations through multifidelity machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for partial differential equations (PDEs) face severe practical constraints on near-term hardware: limited qubit counts restrict spatial resolution to coarse grids, while circuit depth limitations prevent accurate long-time integration. These hardware bottlenecks confine quantum PDE solvers to low-fidelity regimes despite their theoretical potential for computational speedup. We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy. By bridging the gap between hardware-limited quantum simulations and application requirements, this work establishes a pathway for extracting computational value from current quantum devices in real-world scientific applications, advancing both algorithm development and practical deployment of near-term quantum computing for computational physics.</description>

      <title>Microwave electrometry with quantum-limited resolutions in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave (MW) field sensing is foundational to modern technology, yet its evolution, reliant on classical antennas, is constrained by fundamental physical limits on field, temporal, and spatial resolutions. Here, we demonstrate an MW electrometry that simultaneously surpasses these constraints by using individual Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array as coherent sensors. This approach achieves a field sensitivity within 13% of the standard quantum limit, a response time that exceeds the Chu limit by more than 11 orders of magnitude, and in-situ near-field mapping with {\lambda}/3000 spatial resolution. This work establishes Rydberg-atom arrays as a powerful platform that unites quantum-limited sensitivity, nanosecond-scale response time, and sub-micrometer resolution, opening new avenues in quantum metrology and precision electromagnetic field imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hierarchal order of molecular geometry, we compare the performances of Geometric Quantum Machine Learning models. Two molecular datasets are considered: the simplistic linear shaped LiH-molecule and the trigonal pyramidal molecule NH3. Both accuracy and generalizability metrics are considered. A classical equivariant model is used as a baseline for the performance comparison. The comparative performance of Quantum Machine Learning models with no symmetry equivariance, rotational and permutational equivariance, and graph embedded permutational equivariance is investigated. The performance differentials and the molecular geometry in question reveals the criteria for choice of models for generalizability. Graph embedding of features is shown to be an effective pathway to greater trainability for geometric datasets. Permutational symmetric embedding is found to be the most generalizable quantum Machine Learning model for geometric learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$-wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We obtain various analytic formulas based on the two-band Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>How to measure laser chirp rate at single-emitter excitation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple and direct method for measuring laser chirp rate, i.e., group delay dispersion (GDD) of ultrashort laser pulses at power levels compatible with single-quantum-emitter excitation. Traditional pulse characterization techniques rely on nonlinear optical processes that require high peak powers, making them unsuitable for the attojoule-to-femtojoule regime relevant to quantum photonics. Our approach utilizes a wavelength-to-time mapping method in which the arrival times of spectrally filtered components of a broadband pulse are recorded using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and correlated via a high-resolution time-tagging system. The resulting linear relationship between wavelength and arrival time directly yields the dispersion parameter and, subsequently, the GDD. Beyond single-emitter excitation, this technique can be applied in areas such as single-photon spectroscopy, ultralow-power optical communications, and time-domain quantum control, where linear and non-destructive dispersion characterization is essential.</description>

      <title>Sticky eigenstates in systems with sharply-divided phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate mixed eigenstates in systems with sharply-divided phase space, using different piecewise-linear maps whose regular-chaotic boundaries are formed by marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs) or by quasi-periodic orbits. With the overlap index and the entropy localization length, we classify mixed eigenstates and show that the contribution from dynamical tunneling scales as $\sim \hbar\, \exp(-b/\hbar)$, with $b&gt;0$ associated with the relative size of the regular region. The dominant fraction of states that remain sticky to the boundaries, referred to as sticky eigenstates, scales as $\hbar^{1/2}$ in the MUPO case and oscillates around this algebraic behavior in the quasi-periodic case. This behavior generalizes established predictions for hierarchical states in KAM systems, which scale as $\hbar^{1 - 1/\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ set by the corresponding classical stickiness reflected in the algebraic decay of cumulative RTDs $t^{-\gamma}$. For the piecewise-linear maps studied here, $\gamma = 2$. These results reveal a clear quantum signature of classical stickiness in non-KAM systems.</description>

      <title>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability and ergodic properties of quantum trajectories under imperfect measurement, extending previous results established for the ideal case of perfect measurement. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the convergence of the estimated trajectory, initialized from an estimated state, to the true trajectory. This result is obtained assuming that the associated quantum channel is irreducible. Building on this, we prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure and demonstrate convergence toward this measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have been identified as a potential means to accelerate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, with the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) being a promising candidate for realizing quantum speedups. Here, we extend the recent quantum algorithm for the incompressible LBM to account for realistic fluid dynamics setups by incorporating walls, inlets, outlets, and external forcing. We analyze the associated complexity cost and show that these modifications preserve the asymptotic scaling, and potential quantum advantage, of the original algorithm. Moreover, to support our theoretical analysis, we provide a classical numerical study illustrating the accuracy, complexity, and convergence of the algorithm for representative incompressible-flow cases, including the driven Taylor-Green vortex, the lid-driven cavity flow, and the flow past a cylinder. Our results provide a pathway to accurate quantum simulation of nonlinear fluid dynamics, and a framework for extending quantum LBM to more challenging flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05835v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Deep-Space Optical Communication Receiver Based on Single Photon Coherent Beam Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative receiver architecture for deep-space optical communication, in which a single large aperture is replaced by an array of smaller ones with outputs combined coherently, employing phase stabilization based on photon counting events. We show that it allows to increase the signal to noise ratio, thus potentially attaining higher information transmission rates in the regime of large noise, typical for daytime communication. We analyze its practical performance by simulating pulse position modulation-based communication from the recently launched Psyche mission. Under nighttime conditions the achieved performance is comparable to that offered by a single large aperture, whereas in daytime conditions the single photon coherent beam combination architecture provides an advantage in the information transmission rate.</description>

      <title>Indefinite causal key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that is carried out in an indefinite causal order (ICO). In QKD, one considers a setup in which two parties, Alice and Bob, share a key with one another in such a way that they can detect whether an eavesdropper, Eve, has learnt anything about the key. To our knowledge, in all QKD protocols proposed until now, Eve is detected by publicly comparing a subset of Alice and Bob's key and checking for errors. We find that a consequence of our protocol is that it is possible to detect eavesdroppers without publicly comparing any information about the key. Indeed, we prove that it is not possible for eavesdroppers, performing any individual attack, to extract useful information about the shared key without inducing a nonzero probability of being detected. We also prove the security of this protocol against a class of individual eavesdropping attacks. The role ICO plays in causing unusual phenomena in quantum technologies is an important question. By considering it we find a two-way QKD protocol that exhibits a similar private detection feature, albeit with some interesting differences. After noting some implications of these differences and discussing some of the practicalities of our protocol, we conclude that this work is best considered as a first step in applying quantum cryptographic ideas in an ICO.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlated steady states under competing collective and individual decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective dissipation can generate useful quantum correlations, while ubiquitous individual decay destroys them. We study the interplay between these two competing processes considering a driven system of many spins (``atoms") undergoing both collective and individual dissipation (``radiation"). In steady state and depending on drive, we find that the system exhibits a first-order phase transition and quantum bistability: its quantum state is a mixture of two many-body states associated with the two competing decay processes. Accordingly, one of these states closely resembles a correlated ``coherently radiating spin state" (CRSS) -- the solution of purely collective dissipation -- exhibiting spin-squeezing entanglement. We predict dynamical switching between the two stable states, manifest as many-body quantum jumps in the various observables of spin and radiation. Macroscopically, the switching rate tends to vanish and the system can reside in a correlated CRSS for long times. This reveals how correlated dissipative physics emerges at the presence of decorrelating individual decay, opening a path for unlocking collective dissipation phenomena in realistic quantum platforms and applications. We discuss consequences for experiments in collective radiation.</description>

      <title>Explicit quantum surrogates for quantum kernel models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages quantum states for data encoding, with key approaches being explicit models that use parameterized quantum circuits and implicit models that use quantum kernels. Implicit models often have lower training errors but face issues such as overfitting and high prediction costs, while explicit models can struggle with complex training and barren plateaus. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to create an explicit quantum surrogate (EQS) for trained implicit models. This involves diagonalizing an observable from the implicit model and constructing a corresponding quantum circuit using an extended automatic quantum circuit encoding algorithm. The EQS framework reduces prediction costs, provides a powerful strategy to mitigate barren plateau issues, and combines the strengths of both QML approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards practical secure delegated quantum computing with semi-classical light</title>

Abstract: Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC) protocols are a vital piece of the future quantum information processing global architecture since they allow end-users to perform their valuable computations on remote quantum servers without fear that a malicious quantum service provider or an eavesdropper might acquire some information about their data or algorithm. They also allow end-users to check that their computation has been performed as they have specified it.
  However, existing protocols all have drawbacks that limit their usage in the real world. Most require the client to either operate a single-qubit source or perform single-qubit measurements, thus requiring them to still have some quantum technological capabilities albeit restricted, or require the server to perform operations which are hard to implement on real hardware (e.g isolate single photons from laser pulses and polarisation-preserving photon-number quantum non-demolition measurements). Others remove the need for quantum communications entirely but this comes at a cost in terms of security guarantees and memory overhead on the server's side.
  We present an SDQC protocol which drastically reduces the technological requirements of both the client and the server while providing information-theoretic composable security. More precisely, the client only manipulates an attenuated laser pulse, while the server only handles interacting quantum emitters with a structure capable of generating spin-photon entanglement. The quantum emitter acts as both a converter from coherent laser pulses to polarisation-encoded qubits and an entanglement generator. Such devices have recently been used to demonstrate the largest entangled photonic state to date, thus hinting at the readiness of our protocol for experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Simulating the quantum switch with quantum circuits is computationally hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order transformations acting on input quantum channels in an indefinite causal order, such as the quantum switch, cannot be described by quantum circuits using the same number of calls to the input channels. A natural question is whether they can be simulated, i.e., whether their action can be exactly and deterministically reproduced by a quantum circuit with more calls to the input channels. Here, we prove that the quantum switch acting on two $n$-qubit channels cannot be simulated by any quantum circuit using $k$ calls to one channel and one to the other, if $k&lt;2^n$. This establishes an exponential separation in quantum query complexity between processes with indefinite causal order and quantum circuits. Moreover, even with one extra call to both input channels, such a simulation remains impossible. We further demonstrate the robustness of this separation by extending the result to probabilistic and approximate simulations scenarios.</description>

      <title>Superluminal signalling witness for quantum state reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models for quantum state reduction address the quantum measurement problem by suggesting weak modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation that have no observable effect at microscopic scales, but dominate the dynamics of macroscopic objects. Enforcing linearity of the master equation for such models has long been used as a way of ensuring that modifications to Schr\"odinger's equation do not introduce a possibility for superluminal signalling. In large classes of quantum state reduction models, however, and in particular in models employing correlated noise, formulating a master equation for the quantum state is prohibitively difficult or impossible. Here, we formulate a witness for superluminal signalling that is applicable to generic quantum state reduction models, including those involving correlated as well as uncorrelated noise. Surprisingly, application of the witness to known models described by linear master equations shows that these may still admit superluminal signalling, unless a particular locality condition is obeyed. In contrast, we show that the witness introduced here provides a necessary and sufficient condition for excluding superluminal signals under all circumstances. We further apply the witness to several models driven by physical, correlated noise, where linear master equations are not analytically obtainable, and find that they allow for superluminal signalling. We suggest how specific correlated-noise models may be able to avoid it, and that the witness introduced here provides a stringent guide to constructing such models.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimizing the Expected Performance of Sampling-Based Quantum-Inspired Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms has received much attention due to its exponential speedup compared to existing algorithms, under certain data storage assumptions. The improvements are noticeable in fundamental linear algebra tasks. In this work, we analyze two major subroutines in sampling-based quantum-inspired algorithms, specifically, inner product estimation and sampling from a linear combination of vectors, and discuss their possible improvements by generalizing the data structure. The idea is to consider the average behavior of the subroutines under certain assumptions regarding the data elements. This allows us to determine the optimal data structure, and the high-dimensional nature of data makes our assumptions reasonable. Experimental results from recommendation systems also highlight a consistent preference for our proposed data structure. Motivated by this observation, we tighten the upper bound on the number of required measurements for direct fidelity estimation. We expect our findings to suggest optimal implementations for various quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms that involve extremely high-dimensional operations, which has potential for many applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of bosons are a key resource in quantum information science with applications ranging from quantum metrology to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Generation of photonic non-Gaussian resource states, such as Schr\"odinger's cat and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, is challenging. In this work, we extend on existing passive architectures and explore a broad set of adaptive schemes. Our numerical results demonstrate a consistent improvement in the probability of success and fidelity of generating these non-Gaussian quantum states with equivalent resources. We also explore the effect of loss as the primary limiting factor and observe that adaptive schemes lead to more desirable outcomes in terms of overall probability of success and loss tolerance. Our work offers a versatile framework for non-Gaussian resource state generation with the potential to guide future experimental implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. In this framework, we achieve efficient block-encodings by applying the desired action of the operator onto the quantum state and pushing any undesired effects outside of the encoded subspace. This direct approach avoids any overhead caused by expanding the operators in another basis. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic harmonic oscillator, and $\phi^4$ and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE often produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various operators as compared to frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open-source python package to enable further applications.</description>

      <title>Cross-talk in superconducting qubit lattices with tunable couplers -- comparing transmon and fluxonium architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-talk between qubits is one of the main challenges for scaling superconducting quantum processors. Here, we use the density-matrix renormalization-group to numerically analyze lattices of superconducting qubits from a perspective of many-body localization. Specifically, we compare different architectures that include tunable couplers designed to decouple qubits in the idle state, and calculate the residual ZZ interactions as well as the inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states. For transmon qubits outside of the straddling regime, the results confirm that tunable C-shunt flux couplers are significantly more efficient in mitigating the ZZ interactions than tunable transmons. A recently proposed fluxonium architecture with tunable transmon couplers is demonstrated to also maintain its strong suppression of the ZZ interactions in larger systems, while having a higher inverse participation ratio in the computational basis states than lattices of transmon qubits. Our results thus suggest that fluxonium architectures may feature lower cross talk than transmon lattices when designed to achieve similar gate speeds and fidelities.</description>

      <title>Two-Mode Bosonic State Tomography with Single-Shot Joint-Parity Measurement of a Trapped Ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full characterization of a continuous-variable quantum system is a challenging problem. For the trapped-ion system, a number of methods of measuring the quantum states have been developed, including the measurement of the Q quasiprobability function and the density-matrix elements in the Fock basis, but these approaches are often slow and difficult to scale to multimode states. Here, we demonstrate a novel and powerful scheme for measuring a continuous-variable quantum state that uses the direct single-shot measurement of the joint parity of the phonon states of a trapped ion. We drive a spin-dependent bichromatic beam-splitter interaction that coherently exchanges phonons between different harmonic oscillator modes of the ion. This interaction encodes the joint-parity information into the relative phase between the two spin states, enabling measurement of the combined phonon-number parity across multiple modes in a single shot. Leveraging this capability, we directly measure multimode Wigner quasiprobability distributions to perform quantum state tomography of an entangled coherent state, and calculate various quantum informational quantities with a model-based estimation of the density matrix. We further show that the single-shot joint-parity measurement can be used to detect parity-flip errors in real time. By postselecting the parity-measurement outcomes, we experimentally demonstrate the partial recovery of coherence, effectively implementing an error-mitigation technique. Lastly, we identify the various sources of error affecting the fidelity of the spin-dependent beam-splitter operation and study the feasibility of high-fidelity operations. The interaction studied in this work can be extended to more than two modes, and is highly relevant to continuous-variable quantum computing and quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic fields to unprecedented levels by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a single trapped atom. However, random spin precessions limits the useful detection range of arming times for locking high-contrast signals. To extend this range imposed by the uncertainty limit, quadrature spin squeezing can be introduced, on top of the phase-locking mechanism. We propose a detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal $\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable detection window for phase locking is widened.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device -- impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe amplification with 18 dB gain over a wide $400\,$MHz bandwidth centered around $5.3$GHz with added noise approaching the quantum limit, and a saturation power of $-114$dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results, we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical foundation for a regime of JPA operation that has been less explored in literature.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity implementation of a Majorana-encoded CNOT gate on a photonic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate in a Majorana-encoded logical space simulated on a photonic platform. Instead of implementing physical Majorana quasiparticles, our experiment emulates the algebra of Majorana zero modes using photonic degrees of freedom obtained through a Jordan-Wigner mapping. This mapping enables us to simulate two logical qubits, encoded in three Kitaev chains supporting endpoint Majorana operators. Moreover, we realise the unitary representations of both intra-chain and inter-chain Majorana braiding operations that implement the encoded CNOT gate. Due to hardware constraints, the full braiding sequence is executed through a cyclic input-output procedure, requiring an indirect reconstruction of accumulated noise across successive steps. We numerically show that the Majorana encoding offers resilience to the dominant noise in our photonic setup, provided the physical error rate stays below a well-defined threshold. As our experimental error rate (p=0.012) lies beneath this threshold, the experimentally measured encoded CNOT fidelity is significantly enhanced, exceeding 0.992. This reveals a novel pathway to fault-tolerant quantum computing based on Majorana-inspired encodings, even in the absence of full topological protection.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, describes systems in which the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, in contrast to classical hidden-variable descriptions. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that localized interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results show that contextuality is a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum and establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Scalable bayesian shadow tomography for quantum property estimation with set transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A scalable Bayesian machine learning framework is introduced for estimating scalar properties of an unknown quantum state from measurement data, which bypasses full density matrix reconstruction. This work is the first to integrate the classical shadows protocol with a permutation-invariant set transformer architecture, enabling the approach to predict and correct bias in existing estimators to approximate the true Bayesian posterior mean. Measurement outcomes are encoded as fixed-dimensional feature vectors, and the network outputs a residual correction to a baseline estimator. Scalability to large quantum systems is ensured by the polynomial dependence of input size on system size and number of measurements. On Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state fidelity and second-order R\'enyi entropy estimation tasks -- using random Pauli and random Clifford measurements -- this Bayesian estimator always achieves lower mean squared error than classical shadows alone, with more than a 99\% reduction in the few copy regime.</description>

      <title>False Positives of Observable Evaluation induced by Misapplying of Quantum Readout Error Mitigation with Initialization Error Neglected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum readout error mitigation is essential for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices to achieve reliable data. The conventional approaches, conflating initialization errors with measurement errors, not only suppress the influence of measurement errors, but also strengthen that of initialization errors, which is a systematic bias. Here, we demonstrate this exponentially growing bias leads to significant implications. It causes severe fidelity overestimation and gives out false positive results on large-scale entangled state characterizing. Similarly, the results from algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver and time evolution also deviate negatively, and cover up other errors in the quantum circuit. These findings highlight the critical need for rigorous benchmarking and careful management of initialization errors. Consequently, we establish an upper bound for the tolerable initialization error rate to ensure effective error mitigation at a given system scale.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Control of Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing is challenged by environmental drift that relentlessly degrades the quality of quantum operations. The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ can achieve remarkably high encoding rates (about 30% and 20% at concatenation levels 3 and 4, respectively), they have large code block sizes at high levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates per block high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we comprehensively investigate smaller many-hypercube codes with $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a notable fact that $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling Quantum Interior Point Method for Linear Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of huge-scale, data-intensive linear optimization (LO) problems in applications such as machine learning has driven the need for more computationally efficient interior point methods (IPMs). While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their per-iteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations. The proposed algorithm has a quantum complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} \kappa_A \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ queries to QRAM and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ classical arithmetic operations. Our method outperforms the worst-case complexity of prior classical and quantum IPMs, offering a significant improvement in scalability and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Communicating Properties of Quantum States over Classical Noisy Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with Hilbert space fragmentation are characterized by (exponentially) many dynamically disconnected subspaces, not associated with conventional symmetries but captured by nontrivial Krylov subspaces. These subspaces usually exhibit a whole range of thermalization properties, from chaotic to integrable, to quantum many-body scars. However, so far, they have not been properly defined, nor can they be easily found, given a Hamiltonian. In this work, we consider Hamiltonians that have integer representations, a common feature of many (most) celebrated models in condensed matter. We show the equivalence of the integer characteristic polynomial factorization and the existence of Krylov subspaces generated from integer vectors. Considering the pair-hopping model, we illustrate how the factorization property can be used as a method to unveil Hilbert space fragmentation. We discuss the generalization over other rings of integers, for example those based on the cyclotomic field which are relevant when working in a given ($\ne 0, \pi$) momentum sector.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Discrete Superconvergence Analysis for Quantum Magnus Algorithms of Unbounded Hamiltonian Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various applications, unbounded Hamiltonian simulation has recently garnered great attention. Quantum Magnus algorithms, designed to achieve commutator scaling for time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation, have been found to be particularly efficient for such applications. When applied to unbounded Hamiltonian simulation in the interaction picture, they exhibit an unexpected superconvergence phenomenon. However, existing proofs are limited to the spatially continuous setting and do not extend to discrete spatial discretizations. In this work, we provide the first superconvergence estimate in the fully discrete setting with a finite number of spatial discretization points $N$, and show that it holds with an error constant uniform in $N$. The proof is based on the two-parameter symbol class, which, to our knowledge, is applied for the first time in algorithm analysis. The key idea is to establish a semiclassical framework by identifying two parameters through the discretization number and the time step size rescaled by the operator norm, such that the semiclassical uniformity guarantees the uniformity of both. This approach may have broader applications in numerical analysis beyond the specific context of this work.</description>

      <title>Covariant decomposable maps on C*-algebras and quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize covariant positive decomposable maps between unital C*-algebras in terms of a dilation theorem, which generalizes a seminal result by H. Scutaru from Rep. Math. Phys. 16 (1):79-87, 1979. As a case study, we provide a certain characterization of the operator sum representation of maps on $\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, covariant with respect to the maximal commutative subgroup of $\mathrm{U}(n)$. A connection to quantum dynamics is established by specifying sufficient and necessary conditions for covariance of D-divisible (decomposably divisible) quantum evolution families, recently introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 56 (2023) 485202.</description>

      <title>Probes of Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Ergodicity-Breaking Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading interpretation in our current understanding of quantum thermalization. Recent results uncovered strong connections between quantum correlations in thermalizing systems and the structure of free probability theory, leading to the notion of full ETH. However, most studies have been performed for ergodic systems and it is still unclear whether or how full ETH manifests in ergodicity-breaking models. We fill this gap by studying standard probes of full ETH in ergodicity-breaking quantum circuits, presenting numerical and analytical results for interacting integrable systems. These probes can display distinct behavior and undergo a different scaling than the ones observed in ergodic systems. For the analytical results we consider an interacting integrable dual-unitary model and present the exact eigenstates, allowing us to analytically express common probes for full ETH. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for these differences and show how the presence of solitons dictates the behavior of ETH-related quantities in the dual-unitary model. We show numerical evidence that this behavior is sufficiently generic away from dual-unitarity when restricted to the appropriate symmetry sectors.</description>

      <title>Explicit Connections Between Krylov and Nielsen Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between Krylov and Nielsen complexity by choosing the Krylov basis to be part of the elementary gate set of Nielsen geometry and selecting a Nielsen complexity metric compatible with the Krylov metric. Up to normalization, the Krylov complexity of a Hermitian operator then equals the length squared of a straight-line trajectory on the manifold of unitaries that connects the identity operator with a precursor operator. The corresponding length provides an upper bound on Nielsen complexity that saturates whenever the straight line is a minimal geodesic. While for general systems we can only establish saturation in the limit of small precursors, we provide evidence that in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model there is a precise correspondence between Krylov complexity and (the square of) Nielsen complexity for a finite range of precursors.</description>

      <title>Robust, Fast, and efficient formation of stable tetraatomic molecules from ultracold atoms via generalized stimulated Raman exact passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</description>
