      <title>The Lagrangian formulation for wave motion with a shear current and surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian formulation for the irrotational wave motion is straightforward and follows from a Lagrangian functional which is the difference between the kinetic and the potential energy of the system. In the case of fluid with constant vorticity, which arises for example when a shear current is present, the separation of the energy into kinetic and potential is not at all obvious and neither is the Lagrangian formulation of the problem. Nevertheless, we use the known Hamiltonian formulation of the problem in this case to obtain the Lagrangian density function, and utilising the Euler-Lagrange equations we proceed to derive some model equations for different propagation regimes. While the long-wave regime reproduces the well known KdV equation, the short- and intermediate long wave regimes lead to highly nonlinear and nonlocal evolution equations.</description>

      <title>A synchrotron-like pumped ring resonator for water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave-like behaviour of matter in quantum physics has spurred insightful analogies between the dynamics of particles and waves in classical systems. In this study, drawing inspiration from synchrotrons that resonate to accelerate ions along a closed path, we introduce the concept of a synchrowave: a waveguide designed to generate and sustain travelling water waves within a closed annular channel. In analogy to unavoidable energy losses in conventional particle accelerators due to electromagnetic radiation and inelastic collisions, the system displays undesired water-wave dampening, which we address through the synchronised action of underwater wavemakers. Our analogies extend the resonance mechanisms of synchrotrons to generate gravity waves in closed waveguides efficiently. A proof-of-concept experiment at a laboratory scale demonstrates the unique capability of this technique to build up anomalously large travelling waves displaying a flat response in the long-wave limit. Besides quantifying the performance of wave generation, our findings offer a framework for both industrial and computational applications, opening up unexplored possibilities in hydraulics, coastal science and engineering. In a broader context, our experimental apparatus and methods highlight the versatility of a simple yet powerful concept: a closed-path continuous-energy-pumping scheme to effectively harvest prominent resonant responses within wave-supporting systems displaying weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and upcoming quantum hardware presents noise in the computations, requiring algorithms that make modest use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust under resource restrictions. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Classical devices perform nonlinear computations, and quantum ones use variational algorithms to solve the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. A multigrid preconditioning approach helps avoid local minima. HTree, a tomography technique with linear complexity in qubit count, reduces the quantum state readout time. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning wall-model large-eddy simulation accounting for isotropic roughness under local equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a wall model (WM) for large-eddy simulation (LES) applicable to rough surfaces with Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions for both transitionally and fully rough regimes. The model is applicable to arbitrary complex geometries where roughness elements are assumed to be underresolved. The wall model is implemented using a feedforward neural network, with the geometric properties of the roughness topology and near-wall flow quantities serving as input. The optimal set of non-dimensional input features is identified using information theory, selecting variables that maximize information about the output while minimizing redundancy among inputs. The model incorporates a confidence score based on Gaussian process modeling, enabling the detection of low model performance for unseen rough surfaces. The model is trained using a direct numerical simulation roughness database comprising approximately 200 cases. The roughness geometries for the database are selected from a large repository through active learning. This approach ensures that the rough surfaces incorporated into the database are the most informative. The model performance is evaluated both a-priori and a-posteriori in WMLES of turbulent channel flows with rough walls. Over 120 channel flow cases are considered, including untrained roughness geometries, roughness Reynolds numbers, and grid resolutions for both transitionally- and fully-rough regimes. The results show that the rough-wall model predicts the wall shear stress within 15% accuracy. The model is also assessed on a high-pressure turbine blade with two different rough surfaces. The WM predicts the skin friction and the mean velocity deficit within 10% accuracy except the region with shock waves.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the rotating Rayleigh-Taylor instability under the influence of magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined effects of imposed vertical mean magnetic field (B0) and rotation on heat transfer phenomenon driven by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability are investigated using DNS. In the hydrodynamic (HD) case (B0 = 0), as the rotation rate f increases from 4 to 8, the Coriolis force suppresses the growth of mixing layer height (h) and u3', leading to a reduction in heat transport. The imposed B0 forms vertically elongated thermal plumes that exhibit larger u3' and efficiently transport heat between hot and cold fluid. Therefore, we observe an enhancement in heat transfer in the initial regime of unbroken elongated plumes in f=0 MHD cases compared to the corresponding HD case. In the mixing regime, the flow is collimated along the vertical magnetic field lines due to imposed B0, resulting in a decrease in u3' and an increase in growth of h compared to f=0 HD case. This increase in h enhances heat transfer in the mixing regime of f=0 MHD over the corresponding HD case. When rotation is added along with imposed B0, the growth and breakdown of vertically elongated plumes are inhibited by the Coriolis force, reducing h and u3'. Consequently, heat transfer is also reduced in rotating MHD cases compared to corresponding f=0 MHD cases. The heat transfer in rotating MHD cases remains higher than in corresponding rotating HD cases. This also suggests that B0 mitigates the instability-suppressing effect of the Coriolis force. The t.k.e. budget reveals the conversion of t.k.e., generated by the buoyancy flux, into t.m.e..</description>

      <title>The role of coherent airflow structures on the incipient aeolian entrainment of coarse particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of coherent airflow structures capable of setting gravel-size particles in motion is studied theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, a micromechanical model based on energy conservation is proposed to describe the incipient motion of large particles ranging from rocking (incomplete entrainment) to incipient rolling (full entrainment). Wind tunnel experiments were conducted on an aerodynamically rough bed surface under near-threshold airflow conditions. Synchronous signals of airflow velocities upwind of the test particles and particle displacement are measured using a hot film anemometer and a laser distance sensor, respectively, from which coherent airflow structures (extracted via quadrant analysis) and particle movements are interlinked. It is suggested that the incipient motion of gravel-size particles (rocking and rolling) may result from sufficiently energetic sweep events corresponding to aerodynamic drag forces in excess of the local micro-topography resistance. However, full entrainment in rolling mode should satisfy the presented work-based criterion. Furthermore, using an appropriate probabilistic frame, the proposed criterion may be suitable for describing processes of energy transfer from the wind to the granular soil surface, ranging from the creep transport of gravels to the "mechanical sieving" of mega-ripples, as well as the transport of light anthropogenic debris (such as plastics).</description>

      <title>Dynamics of inviscid annular supersonic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into the dynamics of inviscid annular supersonic jets, akin to those exiting converging-diverging nozzles in over-expanded regimes. It focuses on the first azimuthal Fourier mode of flow fluctuations and examines their behavior with varying mixing layer parameters and expansion regimes. The study reveals that two unstable Kelvin-Helmholtz waves exist in all cases, with the outer layer wave being more unstable due to velocity gradient differences. The inner layer wave is more sensitive to base flow changes and extends beyond the jet, potentially contributing to nozzle resonances. The article also investigates guided-jet modes, which are found to be robust and not highly sensitive to base flow parameters, making them essential for understanding jet dynamics. A simplified model is used to obtain ideal base flows with realistic shape to study varying nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) effects on the dynamics of the waves supported by the jet.</description>

      <title>Discovering an interpretable mathematical expression for a full wind-turbine wake with artificial intelligence enhanced symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of wind power worldwide underscores the critical significance of engineering-focused analytical wake models in both the design and operation of wind farms. These theoretically-derived ana lytical wake models have limited predictive capabilities, particularly in the near-wake region close to the turbine rotor, due to assumptions that do not hold. Knowledge discovery methods can bridge these gaps by extracting insights, adjusting for theoretical assumptions, and developing accurate models for physical processes. In this study, we introduce a genetic symbolic regression (SR) algorithm to discover an interpretable mathematical expression for the mean velocity deficit throughout the wake, a previously unavailable insight. By incorporating a double Gaussian distribution into the SR algorithm as domain knowledge and designing a hierarchical equation structure, the search space is reduced, thus efficiently finding a concise, physically informed, and robust wake model. The proposed mathematical expression (equation) can predict the wake velocity deficit at any location in the full-wake region with high precision and stability. The model's effectiveness and practicality are validated through experimental data and high-fidelity numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Temperature and pressure jump coefficients at a liquid-vapor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature and pressure jump coefficients at a liquid-vapor interface are calculated from the solution of the Shakhov kinetic model for the linearized Boltzmann equation. Complete and partial evaporation/condensation at the vapor-liquid interface are assumed as the boundary condition. The discrete velocity method is used to solve the problem numerically. The jump coefficients are tabulated as functions of the evaporation/condensation coefficient. The profiles of the vapor temperature and pressure deviations from that values at the interface corresponding to the liquid temperature and saturation pressure are plotted and the solutions obtained from kinetic theory and continuum approach are shown to underline the effect of jumps at the interface. The obtained results have been compared to those given by other authors, who applied the linearized Boltzmann equation as well as the model proposed by Bhatangar, Gross and Krook to it, and it was found that the pressure and temperature jump coefficients are relatively insensitive to the collision laws.</description>

      <title>A level set-based solver for two-phase incompressible flows: Extension to magnetic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of a two-phase incompressible solver for magnetic flows in the magnetostatic case is presented. The proposed numerical toolkit couples the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism to model the behaviour of magnetic flows in the presence of a magnetic field. To this end, a rigorous implementation of a second-order two-phase solver for incompressible nonmagnetic flows is introduced first. This solver is implemented in the finite-difference framework, where a fifth-order conservative level set method is employed to capture the evolution of the interface, along with an incompressible solver based on the projection scheme to model the fluids. The solver demonstrates excellent performance even with high density ratios across the interface (Atwood number $\approx 1$), while effectively preserving the mass conservation property. Subsequently, the numerical discretization of Maxwell's equations under the magnetostatic assumption is described in detail, utilizing the vector potential formulation. The primary second-order solver for two-phase flows is extended to the case of magnetic flows, by incorporating the Lorentz force into the momentum equation, accounting for high magnetic permeability ratios across the interface. The implemented solver is then utilized for examining the deformation of ferrofluid droplets in both quiescent and shear flow regimes across various susceptibility values of the droplets. The results suggest that increasing the susceptibility value of the ferrofluid droplet can affect its deformation and rotation in low capillary regimes. In higher capillary flows, increasing the magnetic permeability jump across the interface can further lead to droplet breakup as well. The effect of this property is also investigated for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth in magnetic fluids.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity study of three-dimensional turbulent transonic buffet on wide-span infinite wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent transonic buffet is an aerodynamic instability causing periodic oscillations of lift/drag in aerospace applications. Involving complex coupling between inviscid and viscous effects, buffet is characterised by shock-wave oscillations and flow separation/reattachment. Previous studies have identified both 2D chordwise shock-oscillation and 3D buffet/stall-cell modes. While the 2D instability has been studied extensively, investigations of 3D buffet have been limited to only low-fidelity simulations or experiments. Due to computational costs, almost all high-fidelity studies to date have been limited to narrow span-widths around 5% of aerofoil chord length (aspect ratio, $AR = 0.05$), which is insufficiently wide to observe large-scale three-dimensionality. In this work, high-fidelity simulations are performed up to $AR=3$, on infinite unswept NASA-CRM wing profiles at $Re=5\times 10^{5}$. At $AR \geq 1$, intermittent 3D separation bubbles are observed at buffet conditions. While previous RANS/stability-based studies predict simultaneous onset of 2D- and 3D-buffet, a case with buffet that remains essentially-2D despite span-widths up to $AR=2$ is identified here. Strongest three-dimensionality was observed near the low-lift phases of the buffet cycle at maximum flow separation, reverting to essentially-2D behaviour during high-lift phases. Buffet was found to become three-dimensional when extensive mean flow separation was present. At $AR \geq 2$, multiple 3D separation bubbles form, in a wavelength range of $\lambda=\left[1c-1.5c\right]$. SPOD and cross-correlations were applied to analyse the spatio/temporal structure of 3D buffet-cells. In addition to the 2D chordwise shock-oscillation mode (Strouhal number $St \approx 0.07-0.1$), 3D modal structures were found in the shocked region of the flow at $St \approx 0.002-0.004$.</description>

      <title>The stability analysis of volatile liquid films in different evaporation regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the evaporation regime on the stability of a volatile liquid film flowing over an inclined heated surface while considering the dynamics of both the liquid phase and the diffusion of its vapor. We (i) modify the kinetic-diffusion evaporation model of Sultan et al. [Sultan et al., J. Fluid Mech. 543, 183, (2005)] to allow for the reduction in film thickness caused by evaporative mass loss, (ii) combine it with the liquid film formulation of Joo et al. [Joo et al., J. Fluid Mech. 230, 117, (1991)], and then (iii) utilize long-wave theory to derive a governing equation encapsulating the effects of inertia, hydrostatic pressure, surface tension, thermocapillarity, and evaporation. The system's dispersion relationship reveals that the Marangoni effect has two distinct components. The first results from surface tension gradients driven by the uneven heating of the liquid interface and is always destabilizing, while the second arises from surface tension gradients caused by imbalances in its latent cooling tied to vapor diffusion above it and is either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the evaporation regime. These two components interact with evaporative mass loss and vapor recoil in a rich and dynamic manner. Moreover, we identify an evaporation regime where the kinetic and diffusion phenomena are precisely balanced and we clarify the dependence of the mass loss instability on the wave number, which we attribute to the presence of a variable vapor gradient above the liquid. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of film thinning on its stability at the two opposing limits of the evaporation regime. Finally, we conduct a spatiotemporal analysis which indicates that the strength of vapor diffusion effects is generally correlated with a shift towards absolute instability, while the thinning of the film can cause convective-to-absolute-to-convective transitions.</description>

      <title>A GPU-ready pseudo-spectral method for direct numerical simulations of multiphase turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we detail the GPU-porting of an in-house pseudo-spectral solver tailored towards large-scale simulations of interface-resolved simulation of drop- and bubble-laden turbulent flows. The code relies on direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, used to describe the flow field, coupled with a phase-field method, used to describe the shape, deformation, and topological changes of the interface of the drops or bubbles. The governing equations -Navier-Stokes and Cahn-Hilliard equations-are solved using a pseudo-spectral method that relies on transforming the variables in the wavenumber space. The code targets large-scale simulations of drop- and bubble-laden turbulent flows and relies on a multilevel parallelism. The first level of parallelism relies on the message-passing interface (MPI) and is used on multi-core architectures in CPU-based infrastructures. A second level of parallelism relies on OpenACC directives and cuFFT libraries and is used to accelerate the code execution when GPU-based infrastructures are targeted. The resulting multiphase flow solver can be efficiently executed in heterogeneous computing infrastructures and exhibits a remarkable speed-up when GPUs are employed. Thanks to the modular structure of the code and the use of a directive-based strategy to offload code execution on GPUs, only minor code modifications are required when targeting different computing architectures. This improves code maintenance, version control and the implementation of additional modules or governing equations.</description>

      <title>The system of the vortex-like structures: the viewpoint on a turbulence modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we suggest new approach to turbulence modeling. To develop this approach, we construct the set of the vortex-like dynamical systems evolving in the space $E_3$. These systems are constructed using the AKNS hierarchy so that they generalize thin closed vortex filament described in the local induction approximation. We construct and investigate the Hamiltonian dynamics of these systems in terms of the non - standard variables. We formulate the principles of quantization these systems focusing on the quantum description of the filaments with linearized dynamics. To describe the energy of vortex-like structures, we apply a new method based on the use of the central extended Galilei group. In a special case, we calculate the energy levels of a system of quantized vortices. The proposed approach makes it possible to describe both the interaction of such vortex - like filaments and the processes of their creation and annihilation in a natural way. As a result, we have constructed a quantum turbulent flow model that demonstrates the relationship between stochastic and integrable dynamics.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of hot synchronized planet--gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times--in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Model for Yield Stress Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we formulate a thermodynamically consistent rheological model for yield stress fluids by introducing an internal dynamic variable and extending the framework established by Kamani et al (2021) and the classical Oldroyd-B model. The dynamics of the internal variable capture the material's transient response to changes in deformation, characterized by an effective relaxation time, elastic modulus, and viscosity. To assess the model's validity and range of applicability, we compare it with the recently developed Kamani-Donley-Rogers (KDR) model in terms of various material and rheometric functions, highlighting both divergences and parallels between the two models. Our numerical results on a host of material functions and rheological parameters illustrate the practical applicability and advantages of the new thermodynamically consistent model over the KDR model. Specifically, the new model complies with the second law of thermodynamics and can describe a broader range of rheological properties of yield stress fluids.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Hybrid-Spectral Incompressible Navier-Stokes Model For Nonlinear Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new high-order accurate computational fluid dynamics model based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a free surface for the accurate simulation of nonlinear and dispersive water waves in the time domain. The spatial discretization is based on Chebyshev polynomials in the vertical direction and a Fourier basis in the horizontal direction, allowing for the use of the fast Chebyshev and Fourier transforms for the efficient computation of spatial derivatives. The temporal discretization is done through a generalized low-storage explicit 4th order Runge-Kutta, and for the scheme to conserve mass and achieve high-order accuracy, a velocity-pressure coupling needs to be satisfied at all Runge-Kutta stages. This result in the emergence of a Poisson pressure problem that constitute a geometric conservation law for mass conservation. The occurring Poisson problem is proposed to be solved efficiently via an accelerated iterative solver based on a geometric $p$-multigrid scheme, which takes advantage of the high-order polynomial basis in the spatial discretization and hence distinguishes itself from conventional low-order numerical schemes. We present numerical experiments for validation of the scheme in the context of numerical wave tanks demonstrating that the $p$-multigrid accelerated numerical scheme can effectively solve the Poisson problem that constitute the computational bottleneck, that the model can achieve the desired spectral convergence, and is capable of simulating wave-propagation over non-flat bottoms with excellent agreement in comparison to experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Carleman linearization approach to the quantum simulation of classical fluids based on Grad's generalized hydrodynamics and compare it to previous investigations based on lattice Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes formulations. We show that the Carleman-Grad procedure exhibits intermediate properties between the two. Namely, convergence of the Carleman iteration over a few tens of timesteps and a potentially viable quantum circuit implementation using quantum linear algebra solvers. However, both features still need substantial improvements to yield a viable quantum algorithm for fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Statistics of drops generated from ensembles of randomly corrugated ligaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.16192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of drops generated by the capillary-driven disintegration of liquid ligaments plays a fundamental role in several important natural phenomena, ranging from heat and mass transfer at the ocean-atmosphere interface to pathogen transmission. The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing the ligament destabilization leads to significant differences in the resulting drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions. Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations. Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface corrugations. The simulations are grouped in a large ensemble, each corresponding to a random initial configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. Four different distributions are tested, volume-based Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma and Log-Normal. Depending on the time, range of droplet sizes and criteria for success, each distribution has successes and failures. However the Log-Normal distribution roughly describes the data when fitting both the primary peak and the tail of the distribution while the number of droplets generated is the highest, while the Gamma and Log-Normal distributions perform equally well when fitting the tail. The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity of drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Newtonian fluid dynamics in a misaligned parallel-plate rheometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parallel-plate rotational rheometer measures the viscosity of a fluid by rotating the top plate relative to the bottom plate in order to induce a shear on the fluid and measuring the torques and forces that result as a function of the induced rotation rate. Manufacturing imperfections can often lead to unintentional misalignment of the plates of the rheometer, where the top and bottom plates are not perfectly parallel, and this misalignment can affect the fluid dynamics inside the rheometer. This study examines the effect that misalignment has on the viscosity measurements of Newtonian fluids in the limit of small rheometer gap heights. A theoretical model for the behavior of a general Newtonian fluid in a misaligned rheometer with a small gap height is derived using perturbation expansions. The theoretical results show that at small gap heights, misalignment can produce additional secondary velocity components and pressures in the fluid, which affect the forces and moments in the rheometer. In such cases at small Reynolds numbers, the dominant forces and moments acting on the top plate of the rheometer are the viscous force in the direction parallel to the tilt axis, the pressure moment in the direction perpendicular to the tilt axis and in the cross-sectional plane, and the viscous moment in the direction along the height of the rheometer. These forces and moments on the top plate were found to increase as the misalignment tilt angle increases, leading to the rheometer underestimating the viscosity of the fluid by a greater magnitude with larger tilt angles. Three-dimensional numerical simulations validate the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypersonic boundary layers exhibit diverse transition pathways, influenced by various flow conditions and environments. Non-modal mechanisms, such as the lift-up effect, are recognized as pivotal contributors to transition, particularly over complex geometries like rough walls or blunted forebodies. In this study, we investigate the impact of steady streaks on the transition to turbulence in hypersonic boundary layers. Streaky baseflows are generated using optimal disturbances at the inlet, forming the basis for our analysis. We conduct linearized direct numerical simulations on these baseflows at Mach number $M_\infty=6.0$, using white noise forcing to trigger instabilities. An efficient extension of the SPOD method is applied to identify and track the instabilities originating from the broadband forcing on the 3D non-homogeneous baseflows. The results highlight the dominant influence of low-frequency first-mode instabilities and streak-associated instabilities in the linear regime. These findings emphasize the critical role of streaks in hypersonic boundary layer transition and provide valuable insights into this complex phenomenon.</description>

      <title>On the self-similarity of unbounded viscous Marangoni flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Marangoni flow induced by an insoluble surfactant on a fluid-fluid interface is a fundamental problem investigated extensively due to its implications in colloid science, biology, the environment, and industrial applications. Here, we study the limit of a deep liquid subphase with negligible inertia (low Reynolds number $Re\ll{1}$), where the two-dimensional problem has been shown to be described by the complex Burgers equation. We analyze the problem through a self-similar formulation, providing further insights into its structure and revealing its universal features. Six different similarity solutions are found. One of the solutions includes surfactant diffusion, whereas the other five, which are identified through a phase-plane formalism, hold only in the limit of negligible diffusion (high surface P\'eclet number $Pe_s\gg{1}$). Surfactant `pulses', with a locally higher concentration that spreads outward, lead to two similarity solutions of the first kind with a similarity exponent $\beta=1/2$. On the other hand, distributions that are locally depleted and flow inwards lead to similarity of the second kind, with two different exponents that we obtain exactly using stability arguments. We distinguish between `dimple' solutions, where the surfactant has a quadratic minimum and $\beta=2$, from `hole' solutions, where the concentration profile is flatter than quadratic and $\beta=3/2$. Each of these two cases exhibits two similarity solutions, one prior to a critical time $t_*$ when the derivative of the concentration is singular, and another one valid after $t_*$. We obtain all six solutions in closed form, and discuss useful predictions that can be extracted from these results.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through channels with rectangular cross-sections. We obtain a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter describing the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. Applied to square channels, we observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. We briefly illustrate how these results extend to rectangular cross-sections with width/height ratio larger than one. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity limit for axisymmetric vortex rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $R^3$ with low viscosity $\nu&gt;0$, we consider the Cauchy problem with initial vorticity $\omega_0$ that represents an infinitely thin vortex filament of arbitrary given strength $\Gamma$ supported on a circle. The vorticity field $\omega(x,t)$ of the solution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of thickness $\sqrt{\nu t}$ that is translated along its symmetry axis due to self-induction, an effect anticipated by Helmholtz in 1858 and quantified by Kelvin in 1867. For small viscosities, we show that $\omega(x,t)$ is well-approximated on a large time interval by $\omega_{lin}(x-a(t),t)$, where $\omega_{lin}(\cdot,t)=\exp(\nu t\Delta)\omega_0$ is the solution of the heat equation with initial data $\omega_0$, and $\dot a(t)$ is the instantaneous velocity given by Kelvin's formula. This gives a rigorous justification of the binormal motion for circular vortex filaments in weakly viscous fluids. The proof relies on the construction of a precise approximate solution, using a perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. To verify the stability of this approximation, one needs to rule out potential instabilities coming from very large advection terms in the linearized operator. This is done by adapting V. I. Arnold's geometric stability methods developed in the inviscid case $\nu=0$ to the slightly viscous situation. It turns out that although the geometric structures behind Arnold's approach are no longer preserved by the equation for $\nu &gt; 0$, the relevant quadratic forms behave well on larger subspaces than those originally used in Arnold's theory and interact favorably with the viscous terms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Feature-based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Flow Control of Circular Cylinder with Sparse Surface Pressure Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a self-learning algorithm for closed-loop cylinder wake control targeting lower drag and lower lift fluctuations with the additional challenge of sparse sensor information, taking deep reinforcement learning as the starting point. DRL performance is significantly improved by lifting the sensor signals to dynamic features (DF), which predict future flow states. The resulting dynamic feature-based DRL (DF-DRL) automatically learns a feedback control in the plant without a dynamic model. Results show that the drag coefficient of the DF-DRL model is 25% less than the vanilla model based on direct sensor feedback. More importantly, using only one surface pressure sensor, DF-DRL can reduce the drag coefficient to a state-of-the-art performance of about 8% at Re = 100 and significantly mitigate lift coefficient fluctuations. Hence, DF-DRL allows the deployment of sparse sensing of the flow without degrading the control performance. This method also shows good robustness in controlling flow under higher Reynolds numbers, which reduces the drag coefficient by 32.2% and 46.55% at Re = 500 and 1000, respectively, indicating the broad applicability of the method. Since surface pressure information is more straightforward to measure in realistic scenarios than flow velocity information, this study provides a valuable reference for experimentally designing the active flow control of a circular cylinder based on wall pressure signals, which is an essential step toward further developing intelligent control in realistic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Optimized High-Order Schemes for Discretization of Non-Linear Straight and Mixed Second Derivative Terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new set of midpoint-based high-order discretization schemes for computing straight and mixed nonlinear second derivative terms that appear in the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Firstly, we detail a set of conventional fourth and sixth-order baseline schemes that utilize central midpoint derivatives for the calculation of second derivatives terms. To enhance the spectral properties of the baseline schemes, an optimization procedure is proposed that adjusts the order and truncation error of the midpoint derivative approximation while still constraining the same overall stencil width and scheme order. A new filter penalty term is introduced into the midpoint derivative calculation to help achieve high wavenumber accuracy and high-frequency damping in the mixed derivative discretization. Fourier analysis performed on the both straight and mixed second derivative terms show high spectral efficiency and minimal numerical viscosity with no odd-even decoupling effect. Numerical validation of the resulting optimized schemes is performed through various benchmark test cases assessing their theoretical order of accuracy and solution resolution. The results highlight that the present optimized schemes efficiently utilize the inherent viscosity of the governing equations to achieve improved simulation stability - a feature attributed to their superior spectral resolution in the high wavenumber range. The method is also tested and applied to non-uniform structured meshes in curvilinear coordinates, employing a supersonic impinging jet test case.</description>

      <title>The Maintenance of Coherent Vortex Topology by Lagrangian Chaos in Drift-Rossby Wave Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the "potential vorticity bucket brigade," a mechanism for explaining the resilience of vortex structures in magnetically confined fusion plasmas and geophysical flows. Drawing parallels with zonal jet formation, we show how inhomogeneous patterns of mixing can reinforce, rather than destroy non-zonal flow structure. We accomplish this through an exact stochastic Lagrangian representation of vorticity transport, together with a near-integrability property, which relates coherent flow topology to fluid relabeling symmetries. We demonstrate these ideas in the context of gradient-driven magnetized plasma turbulence, though the tools we develop here are model-agnostic and applicable beyond the system studied here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a domain-decomposition-based distributed training and inference approach for message-passing neural networks (MPNN). Our objective is to address the challenge of scaling edge-based graph neural networks as the number of nodes increases. Through our distributed training approach, coupled with Nystr\"om-approximation sampling techniques, we present a scalable graph neural network, referred to as DS-MPNN (D and S standing for distributed and sampled, respectively), capable of scaling up to $O(10^5)$ nodes. We validate our sampling and distributed training approach on two cases: (a) a Darcy flow dataset and (b) steady RANS simulations of 2-D airfoils, providing comparisons with both single-GPU implementation and node-based graph convolution networks (GCNs). The DS-MPNN model demonstrates comparable accuracy to single-GPU implementation, can accommodate a significantly larger number of nodes compared to the single-GPU variant (S-MPNN), and significantly outperforms the node-based GCN.</description>
