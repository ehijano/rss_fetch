      <title>Periodic Orbits in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FPUT paradox is the phenomenon whereby a one-dimensional chain of oscillators with nonlinear couplings shows non-ergodic behavior. The trajectory of the system in phase space, with a long wavelength initial condition, closely follows that of the Toda model over short times, as both systems seem to relax quickly to a non-thermal, metastable state. Over longer times, resonances in the FPUT spectrum drive the system towards equilibrium, away from the Toda trajectory. Similar resonances are observed in $q$-breather spectra, suggesting that $q$-breathers are involved in the route towards thermalization. In this article we investigate such resonances and show that they occur due to exact overlaps of $q$-breather frequencies of the type $m\Omega_1 = \Omega_k$. The resonances appear as peaks in the energy spectrum. Further, they give rise to new composite periodic orbits, which exist simultaneously with the original $q$-breathers. We find that such resonances are absent in integrable systems, as a consequence of the (infinite number of) conservation laws associated with integrability.</description>

      <title>Statistical description of mobile oscillators in embryonic pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization of mobile oscillators occurs in numerous contexts, including physical, chemical, biological and engineered systems. In vertebrate embryonic development, a segmental body structure is generated by a population of mobile oscillators. Cells in this population produce autonomous gene expression rhythms, and interact with their neighbors through local signaling. These cells form an extended tissue where frequency and cell mobility gradients coexist. Gene expression kinematic waves travel through this tissue and pattern the segment boundaries. It has been shown that oscillator mobility promotes global synchronization. However, in vertebrate segment formation, mobility may also introduce local fluctuations in kinematic waves and impair segment boundaries. Here we derive a general framework for mobile oscillators that relates local mobility fluctuations to synchronization dynamics and pattern robustness. We formulate a statistical description of mobile phase oscillators in terms of a probability density. We obtain and solve diffusion equations for the average phase and variance, revealing the relationship between local fluctuations and global synchronization in a homogeneous population of oscillators. Analysis of the probability density for large mobility identifies a mean-field transition, where locally coupled oscillators start behaving as if each oscillator was coupled with all the others. We extend the statistical description to inhomogeneous systems to address the gradients present in the vertebrate segmenting tissue. The theory relates pattern stability to mobility, coupling and pattern wavelength. The general approach of the statistical description may be applied to mobile oscillators in other contexts, as well as to other patterning systems where mobility is present.</description>

      <title>Topological solitons in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of multipole topological solitons at the edges of two and three coupled parallel Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide arrays. We show that independent variations of waveguide spacing in the unit cells (dimers) in coupled waveguide arrays result in the emergence at their edges of several topological edge states with different internal symmetry. The number of emerging edge states is determined by how many arrays are in topologically nontrivial phase. In the presence of nonlinearity, such edge states give rise to families of multipole topological edge solitons with distinct stability properties. Our results illustrate that coupling between quasi-one-dimensional topological structures substantially enriches the variety of stable topological edge solitons existing in them.</description>

      <title>Magnetic skyrmions under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a variational treatment of confined magnetic skyrmions in a minimal micromagnetic model of ultrathin ferromagnetic films with interfacial Dzylashinksii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in competition with the exchange energy, with a possible addition of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions that are motivated by the asymptotic treatment of the stray field energy in the thin film limit we prove existence of topologically non-trivial energy minimizers that concentrate on points in the domain as the DMI strength parameter tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the leading order non-trivial term in the $\Gamma$-expansion of the energy in the limit of vanishing DMI strength that allows us to completely characterize the limiting magnetization profiles and interpret them as particle-like states whose radius and position are determined by minimizing a renormalized energy functional. In particular, we show that in our setting the skyrmions are strongly repelled from the domain boundaries, which imparts them with stability that is highly desirable for applications. We provide explicit calculations of the renormalized energy for a number of basic domain geometries.</description>

      <title>A variational model of charged drops in dielectrically matched binary fluids: the effect of charge discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the ill-posedness of the classical Rayleigh variational model of conducting charged liquid drops by incorporating the discreteness of the elementary charges. Introducing the model that describes two immiscible fluids with the same dielectric constant, with a drop of one fluid containing a fixed number of elementary charges together with their solvation spheres, we interpret the equilibrium shape of the drop as a global minimizer of the sum of its surface energy and the electrostatic repulsive energy between the charges under fixed drop volume. For all model parameters, we establish existence of generalized minimizers that consist of at most a finite number of components ``at infinity''. We also give several existence and non-existence results for classical minimizers consisting of only a single component. In particular, we identify an asymptotically sharp threshold for the number of charges to yield existence of minimizers in a regime corresponding to macroscopically large drops containing a large number of charges. The obtained non-trivial threshold is significantly below the corresponding threshold for the Rayleigh model, consistently with the ill-posedness of the latter and demonstrating a particular regularizing effect of the charge discreteness. However, when a minimizer does exist in this regime, it approaches a ball with the charge uniformly distributed on the surface as the number of charges goes to infinity, just as in the Rayleigh model. Finally, we provide an explicit solution for the problem with two charges and a macroscopically large drop.</description>

      <title>The Method of Formal Series: Applications to Nonlinear Beam Dynamics and Invariants of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel technique to determine invariant curves in nonlinear beam dynamics based on the method of formal series has been developed. It is first shown how the solution of the Hamilton equations of motion describing nonlinear betatron oscillations in the presence of a single sextupole can be represented in a nonperturbative form. Further, the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained in a closed symbolic form as a ratio of two series in the perturbation parameter (and the nonlinear action invariant), rather than a conventional power series according to canonical perturbation theory. It is well behaved even for large values of the perturbation parameter close to strong structural resonances. The relationship between existing invariant curves and the so-called scattering orbits in classical scattering theory has been revealed.</description>
