      <title>Motion and temporal B0 shift corrections for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* mapping using dual-echo spiral navigators and conjugate-phase reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an efficient navigator-based motion and temporal B0 shift correction technique for 3D multi-echo gradient-echo (ME-GRE) MRI for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* mapping. Theory and Methods: A dual-echo 3D spiral navigator was designed to interleave with the Cartesian ME-GRE acquisitions, allowing the acquisition of both low- and high-echo time signals. We additionally designed a novel conjugate-phase based reconstruction method for the joint correction of motion and temporal B0 shifts. We performed both numerical simulation and in vivo human scans to assess the performance of the methods. Results: Numerical simulation and human brain scans demonstrated that the proposed technique successfully corrected artifacts induced by both head motions and temporal B0 changes. Efficient B0-change correction with conjugate-phase reconstruction can be performed on less than 10 clustered k-space segments. In vivo scans showed that combining temporal B0 correction with motion correction further reduced artifacts and improved image quality in both R2* and QSM images. Conclusion: Our proposed approach of using 3D spiral navigators and a novel conjugate-phase reconstruction method can improve susceptibility-related measurements using MR.</description>

      <title>Deep Few-view High-resolution Photon-counting Extremity CT at Halved Dose for a Clinical Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest X-ray photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) for extremity allows multi-energy high-resolution (HR) imaging for tissue characterization and material decomposition. However, both radiation dose and imaging speed need improvement for contrast-enhanced and other studies. Despite the success of deep learning methods for 2D few-view reconstruction, applying them to HR volumetric reconstruction of extremity scans for clinical diagnosis has been limited due to GPU memory constraints, training data scarcity, and domain gap issues. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for PCCT image reconstruction at halved dose and doubled speed in a New Zealand clinical trial. Particularly, we present a patch-based volumetric refinement network to alleviate the GPU memory limitation, train network with synthetic data, and use model-based iterative refinement to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. The simulation and phantom experiments demonstrate consistently improved results under different acquisition conditions on both in- and off-domain structures using a fixed network. The image quality of 8 patients from the clinical trial are evaluated by three radiologists in comparison with the standard image reconstruction with a full-view dataset. It is shown that our proposed approach is essentially identical to or better than the clinical benchmark in terms of diagnostic image quality scores. Our approach has a great potential to improve the safety and efficiency of PCCT without compromising image quality.</description>

      <title>Pulsed RF Knock-Out Extraction: A Potential Enabler for FLASH Hadrontherapy in the Bragg Peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One challenge on the path to delivering FLASH-compatible beams with a synchrotron is facilitating an accurate dose-control for the required ultra-high dose rates. We propose the use of pulsed RFKO extraction instead of continuous beam delivery as a way to control the dose delivered per Voxel. In a first feasibility test dose rates in pulses of up to 600 Gy/s were observed, while the granularity at which the dose was delivered is expected to be well below 0.5 Gy.</description>

      <title>Simplified Shielded MEG-MRI Multimodal System with Scalar-mode Optically Pumped Magnetometers as MEG Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) conventionally operates within high-performance magnetic shields due to the extremely weak magnetic field signals from the measured objects and the narrow dynamic range of the magnetic sensors employed for detection. This limitation results in elevated equipment costs and restricted usage. Additionally, the information obtained from MEG is functional images, and to analyze from which part of the brain the signals are coming, it is necessary to capture morphological images separately. When MEG and morphological imaging devices are separate, despite their individual high measurement accuracies, discrepancies in positional information may arise. In response, we have developed a low-field magnetic resonance imaging system that incorporates scalar-mode optically pumped magnetometers with a wide dynamic range and exceptionally high measurement sensitivity as sensors for MEG. Operating at low magnetic fields eliminates the need for superconducting coils in magnetic resonance imaging and the high-performance magnetic shields essential for MEG, promising a substantial cost reduction compared to traditional approaches. We achieved a noise level of about $16\,\rm{pT/Hz}^{1/2}$ with a single channel magnetometer, and reached a noise level of $367\,\rm{fT/cm/Hz}^{1/2}$ through differential measurements. The system successfully conducted MR imaging on a phantom, demonstrating the potential of MEG and MRI fusion.</description>
