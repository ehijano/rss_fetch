      <title>The impact of the microvascular resistance on the measures of stenosis severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between measures of stenosis and microvascular resistance is of importance due to medical decisions being based on these values. This research investigates the impact of varying microvascular resistance on fractional flow reserve (FFR) and hyperaemic stenosis resistance (hSR). Microvascular resistance is classified using hyperaemic microvascular resistance (hMR). Additionally, hMR using the upstream pressure value (hMRPa) has also been calculated and is compared to hMR measured conventionally. Tests were conducted at three different degrees of stenosis (quantified by percent area) in a coronary flow circuit with varying downstream resistance to simulate the microvasculature. Pressure and flow values are recorded across the stenosed section, allowing for calculation of the diagnostic indexes. Results indicate that for a constant degree of stenosis, FFR would increase with increasing microvascular resistance while hSR would remain almost constant. hMRPa was found to approach hMR as the stenosis severity decreased, and the pressure gradient decreased. In the results shown here, with sufficiently high downstream resistance, an 84% stenosis could produce an FFR value over 0.8. This result suggests that there is the potential for misdiagnosis of the severity of stenosis when combined with elevated microvascular resistance. Consequently, decisions on the clinical significance of a stenosis, classified by FFR, need to consider the effect of the microvascular resistance.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired Soft Grippers for Biological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of bio-inspired soft grippers has emerged as a transformative area of research with profound implications for biomedical applications. This book chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, developments, challenges, and prospects of soft grippers that draw inspiration from biological systems. Bio-inspired soft grippers have gained prominence due to their unique characteristics, including compliance, adaptability, and biocompatibility. They have revolutionized the way we approach biomedical tasks, offering safer interactions with delicate tissues and enabling complex operations that were once inconceivable with rigid tools. The chapter delves into the fundamental importance of soft grippers in biomedical contexts. It outlines their significance in surgeries, diagnostics, tissue engineering, and various medical interventions. Soft grippers have the capacity to mimic the intricate movements of biological organisms, facilitating minimally invasive procedures and enhancing patient outcomes. A historical perspective traces the evolution of soft grippers in biomedical research, highlighting key milestones and breakthroughs. From early attempts to emulate the dexterity of octopus tentacles to the latest advancements in soft lithography and biomaterials, the journey has been marked by ingenuity and collaboration across multiple disciplines. Motivations for adopting soft grippers in biomedical applications are explored, emphasizing their ability to reduce invasiveness, increase precision, and provide adaptability to complex anatomical structures. The requirements and challenges in designing grippers fit for medical contexts are outlined, encompassing biocompatibility, sterilization, control, and integration.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive Extraction of Maternal and Fetal ECG using Periodic Progressive FastICA Peel-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) gives a safe and non-invasive way to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. However, due to the overlap with maternal ECG (MECG) as well as significant external noise, it is challenging to extract weak fetal ECG (FECG) using surface electrodes. In this study, we introduce a novel periodic progressive FastICA peel-off (PPFP) method for noninvasive extraction of weak surface FECG signals, leveraging the two-step FastICA method and a peel-off strategy from the progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) approach. Specifically, for ECG signals, the periodic constrained FastICA that integrates ECG signal characteristics enables precise extraction of MECG and FECG spike trains. Additionally, a peel-off strategy incorporating SVD waveform reconstruction ensures comprehensive identification of subtle source signals. The performance of the proposed method was examined on public datasets with reference, synthetic data and clinical data, with an F1-scores for FECG extraction on public dataset of 99.59%, on synthetic data with the highest noise level of 99.50%, which are all superior to other comparative methods. Furthermore, clearly periodic and physiologically consistent FECG signals were extracted from clinically collected data. The results indicates that our proposed method has potential and effectiveness to separate MECG and weak FECG from multichannel AECG with high precision in high noise condition, which is of vital importance for ensuring the safety of both the fetus and the mother, as well as the advancement of artificial intelligent clinical monitoring.</description>
