      <title>Toward Objective and Interpretable Prosody Evaluation in Text-to-Speech: A Linguistically Motivated Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosody is essential for speech technology, shaping comprehension, naturalness, and expressiveness. However, current text-to-speech (TTS) systems still struggle to accurately capture human-like prosodic variation, in part because existing evaluation methods for prosody remain limited. Traditional metrics like Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and offer little insight into why a system sounds unnatural. This study introduces a linguistically informed, semi-automatic framework for evaluating TTS prosody through a two-tier architecture that mirrors human prosodic organization. The method uses quantitative linguistic criteria to evaluate synthesized speech against human speech corpora across multiple acoustic dimensions. By integrating discrete and continuous prosodic measures, it provides objective and interpretable metrics of both event placement and cue realization, while accounting for the natural variability observed across speakers and prosodic cues. Results show strong correlations with perceptual MOS ratings while revealing model-specific weaknesses that traditional perceptual tests alone cannot capture. This approach provides a principled path toward diagnosing, benchmarking, and ultimately improving the prosodic naturalness of next-generation TTS systems.</description>

      <title>From the perspective of perceptual speech quality: The robustness of frequency bands to noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech quality is one of the main foci of speech-related research, where it is frequently studied with speech intelligibility, another essential measurement. Band-level perceptual speech intelligibility, however, has been studied frequently, whereas speech quality has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper, a Multiple Stimuli With Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) inspired approach was proposed to study the individual robustness of frequency bands to noise with perceptual speech quality as the measure. Speech signals were filtered into thirty-two frequency bands with compromising real-world noise employed at different signal-to-noise ratios. Robustness to noise indices of individual frequency bands was calculated based on the human-rated perceptual quality scores assigned to the reconstructed noisy speech signals. Trends in the results suggest the mid-frequency region appeared less robust to noise in terms of perceptual speech quality. These findings suggest future research aiming at improving speech quality should pay more attention to the mid-frequency region of the speech signals accordingly.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Open-Vocabulary Dysarthric Speech Assessment with Human Perceptual Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dysarthria is a speech disorder characterized by impaired intelligibility and reduced communicative effectiveness. Automatic dysarthria assessment provides a scalable, cost-effective approach for supporting the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. This study investigates leveraging human perceptual annotations from speech synthesis assessment as reliable out-of-domain knowledge for dysarthric speech assessment. Experimental results suggest that such supervision can yield consistent and substantial performance improvements in self-supervised learning pre-trained models. These findings suggest that perceptual ratings aligned with human judgments from speech synthesis evaluations represent valuable resources for dysarthric speech modeling, enabling effective cross-domain knowledge transfer.</description>

      <title>Multiplexing Neural Audio Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio watermarking is a promising tool to ensure authenticity of speech content. However, existing watermarking methods remain vulnerable to more advanced dilution attacks such as lossy compression and neural reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to multiplex neural audio watermarking techniques to leverage their complementarity under different types of attacks. Specifically, five different multiplexing designs are investigated, including parallel, sequential, frequency-division, time-division and perceptual adaptive time-frequency multiplexing (PA-TFM). We evaluate our multiplexing technique on LibriSpeech data with 11 different attack methods, including 2 new neural reconstruction attacks featuring recent advancements in speech processing. As a result, the proposed PA-TFM as a training-free multiplexing method achieves better performance than single watermarking baselines by clear margins, showcasing a more robust way of using watermarks for audio.</description>

      <title>Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.</description>

      <title>An unscented Kalman filter method for real time input-parameter-state estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input. Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters, and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.</description>

      <title>DARAS: Dynamic Audio-Room Acoustic Synthesis for Blind Room Impulse Response Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) accurately characterize acoustic properties of indoor environments and play a crucial role in applications such as speech enhancement, speech recognition, and audio rendering in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Existing blind estimation methods struggle to achieve practical accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we propose the dynamic audio-room acoustic synthesis (DARAS) model, a novel deep learning framework that is explicitly designed for blind RIR estimation from monaural reverberant speech signals. First, a dedicated deep audio encoder effectively extracts relevant nonlinear latent space features. Second, the Mamba-based self-supervised blind room parameter estimation (MASS-BRPE) module, utilizing the efficient Mamba state space model (SSM), accurately estimates key room acoustic parameters and features. Third, the system incorporates a hybrid-path cross-attention feature fusion module, enhancing deep integration between audio and room acoustic features. Finally, our proposed dynamic acoustic tuning (DAT) decoder adaptively segments early reflections and late reverberation to improve the realism of synthesized RIRs. Experimental results, including a MUSHRA-based subjective listening study, demonstrate that DARAS substantially outperforms existing baseline models, providing a robust and effective solution for practical blind RIR estimation in real-world acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</description>

      <title>Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</description>
