      <title>Hall Transport in Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a universal theory to understand quasiparticle Hall effects and transverse charge-carrier transport in organic semiconductors. The simulations are applied to organic crystals inspired by rubrene and cover multiple transport regimes. This includes calculations of the intrinsic Hall conductivity in pristine crystals, which are connected with a simple description of semi-classical electron transport that involves the concept of closed electronic orbits in the band structure, which can be easily calculated in density functional theory. Furthermore, this framework is employed to simulate temperature-dependent longitudinal and transverse mobilities in rubrene. These simulations are compared to experimental findings, providing insights into these results by characterizing the non-ideality of the Hall effect due to the influence of vibrational disorder. We finally investigate the conditions for the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal resistivity and quantized Hall plateaus in the transverse resistivity. A clear picture why this is not observed in rubrene is developed. These insights into classical and quantum Hall effects and their intermediates in organic semiconductors establish a blueprint for future explorations in similar systems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Coulomb interactions in correlated transition-metal perovskite oxides from the constrained random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the strength of electronic correlations of correlated electrons plays important roles in accurately describing the electronic structures and physical properties of transition-metal (TM) perovskite oxides. Here, we study the evolution of electronic interaction parameters as a function of $d$-electron occupancy in an extended class of TM perovskite oxides $AB$O$_3$ ($A$=Sr, Ca, and $B$=3$d$-5$d$ TM elements) using the constrained random-phase-approximation method adopting two distinct models: $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ and $d$-$dp$. For Sr$B$O$_3$ with $B$=Fe, Ru, and Ir, the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model faces critical challenges, as the low-energy Hamiltonian spanning $t_{2g}$ manifolds is ill-defined. The $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model suggests that, for early $AB$O$_3$ series ($B$=$d^1$-$d^3$), the bare Coulomb interaction parameters $V$ remain nearly constant due to the competition between extended $t_{2g}$ Wannier orbitals and bandwidth reduction. As the $d$-electron filling increases, both partially screened Coulomb interaction parameters $U$ and fully screened Coulomb interaction parameters $W$ decrease, which are attributed to enhanced $e_g$-$t_{2g}$ and $e_g$-$p$ screenings. In contrast to the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model, the $d$-$dp$ model effectively handles both early and late $AB$O$_3$ perovskites and reveals different trends. Specifically, $V$ varies inversely with the spreads of $d$-orbitals. $W$ reaches its minimum at the $d^3$ occupancy due to an interplay between increasing $d$-orbital localization and increasing screening effects. An unusual trend is observed for $U$, with local maxima at both $d^1$ and $d^4$ occupations. This can be understood from two aspects: (1) the increasing full screening effects from $d^1$ to $d^3$ and (2) the strongest $d$-$d$ and the weakest $d$-$p$ screening effects near $d^4$ for Sr$B$O$_3$.</description>

      <title>Brookite TiO2 as an active photocatalyst for photoconversion of plastic wastes to acetic acid and simultaneous hydrogen production: Comparison with anatase and rutile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoreforming is a clean photocatalytic technology for simultaneous plastic waste degradation and hydrogen fuel production, but there are still limited active and stable catalysts for this process. This work introduces the brookite polymorph of TiO2 as an active photocatalyst for photoreforming with an activity higher than anatase and rutile polymorphs for both hydrogen production and plastic degradation. Commercial brookite successfully converts polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic to acetic acid under light. The high activity of brookite is attributed to good charge separation, slow decay and moderate electron trap energy, which lead to a higher generation of hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals and accordingly enhanced photo-oxidation of PET plastic. These results introduce brookite as a stable and active catalyst for the photoconversion of water contaminated with microplastics to value-added organic compounds and hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Impact of high-pressure torsion on hydrogen production from photodegradation of polypropylene plastic wastes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic waste entering the environment through landfilling or improper disposal poses substantial risks to ecosystems and human health. Photoreforming is emerging as a clean photocatalytic technology that degrades plastic waste to organic compounds while simultaneously producing hydrogen fuel. This study introduces high-pressure torsion (HPT), a severe plastic deformation (SPD) method, as an innovative technique to enhance the photoreforming of polypropylene (PP) plastic mixed with a brookite TiO2 photocatalyst. Hydrogen production systematically increases with the number of HPT turns, accompanied by the formation of valuable small organic molecules. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity is attributed to strain-induced defect formation in both catalysts and plastics, as well as the creation of catalyst/plastic interphases that enhance charge carrier transport between inorganic and organic phases. These findings reveal a new functional application for SPD in energy conversion and sustainability.</description>

      <title>High-pressure torsion processing of serine and glutamic acid: Understanding mechanochemical behavior of amino acids under astronomical impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical impacts by small solar system bodies (meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and transitional objects) are considered a mechanism for delivering amino acids and their polymerization to proteins in early Earth conditions. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is a new methodology to simulate such impacts and clarify the behavior of biomolecules. In this study, two amino acids, crystalline L-serine and L-glutamic acid that were detected in meteorites, are processed by HPT and examined by ex situ X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ mechanical shear testing. No polymerization, chemical reactions, or phase transformations are detected after HPT, indicating that the stability and presence of these two amino acids in meteorites are quite reasonable. However, some microstructural and mechanical changes like crystal size reduction to the nanometer level, crystal defect formation, lattice expansion by vacancy formation, and shear strength enhancement to the steady state are found which are similar to the behaviors reported in metals and ceramics after HPT processing.</description>

Abstract: Azide functionalization produced luminescent sp2-type defects on single-walled carbon nanotubes, by which defect photoluminescence appeared in near infrared regions (1116 nm). Changes in exciton properties were induced by localization effects at the defect sites, creating exciton-engineered nanomaterials based on the defect structure design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have successfully prepared two novel mixed-valence compounds of silver, Ag(I)Ag(II)F3 and Ag(I)2Ag(II)F4. They may be considered to be long-sought strongly electron-overdoped Ag(II)F2. Their crystal structures indicate that both belong to the Class I (mixed-valence) family with frozen Ag(I) and Ag(II) valences. The measured Raman spectra are well-correlated with the theoretical ones. Density functional theory calculations reveal their smaller fundamental band gaps as compared to pristine AgF2, due to the presence of Ag(I) states in the valence band.</description>

      <title>Low energy phonons in single crystal ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is the prototypical example of a material exhibiting negative thermal expansion (NTE). As well as being among the first NTE materials to be studied in detail, it has served as a test bed for ideas for the physical mechanisms that lead to this unusual behavior. It is now widely accepted that here, and in many other framework materials exhibiting NTE, a collection of low energy phonon modes, as opposed to just one or two, are responsible for the anomalous thermal properties. However, quantitative verification and analysis of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations which underpin this proposal are still lacking. In particular, probing the low energy phonons directly throughout reciprocal space using inelastic neutron scattering, as opposed to other techniques which only probe the Brillouin zone center, is technically challenging and hence rarely done. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements in a large number of Brillouin zones, achieved via the time of flight technique, over a 400 K temperature range. We find excellent agreement between DFT calculations and experimental data at low temperature, albeit with a rescaling of the calculated phonon energies, and of the lattice parameter used in the calculations compared to the measured value. However, the shifts in phonon modes due to the reduction in lattice parameter on warming, that can be predicted using DFT, are not observed. This is most likely due to counteractive anharmonic effects arising from the increased amplitude of lattice vibrations at elevated temperatures. Notwithstanding, the good agreement between experiment and DFT gives high confidence that the theory's predictions of atomic motions for different modes is correct, and hence can be used as a reliable basis for quantitative analysis of NTE effects.</description>

      <title>Data-driven prediction of structure of metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) has proven to be a highly effective route for discovering new materials. Substantial advancements have been made in CSP of inorganic and molecular crystals, while hybrid materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been unfairly overlooked. The ab initio techniques adopted for the CSP of MOFs cannot be scaled to a high-throughput regime, which is required for efficient exploration of the immense chemical space. Here, we propose a data-driven method to tackle current needs of computational MOF discovery. By examining CSP through the lens of reticular chemistry, coarse-grained neural networks were implemented to predict underlying net topology of crystal graphs. The models showed satisfactory performance, which was next enhanced by limiting the applicability domain. Flue gas separation was used as an illustrative example to validate the proposed CSP approach. Several hundred in silico-generated systems revealed a notable discrepancy in adsorption capacity among competing polymorphs.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties of kagome metals CsM$_3$Te$_5$ (M = Ti, Zr, Hf)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals are a unique class of quantum materials characterized by their distinct atomic lattice arrangement, featuring interlocking triangles and expansive hexagonal voids. These lattice structures impart exotic properties, including superconductivity, interaction-driven topological many-body phenomena, and magnetism, among others. The kagome metal CsM3Te5 (where M = Ti, Zr, or Hf) exhibits both superconductivity and nontrivial topological electronic properties, offering a promising platform for exploring topological superconductivity. This study employs first-principles density functional theory calculations to systematically analyze the elastic, mechanical, vibrational, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of CsM3Te5 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf). Our calculations reveal that the studied compounds - CsTi3Te5, CsZr3Te5, and CsHf3Te5 - are ductile metals with elastic properties akin to the hexagonal Bi and Sb, with average elastic constants, including a bulk modulus of 27 GPa, a shear modulus of 11 GPa, and Young's modulus of 29 GPa. We observe peculiar dispersionless, flat, phonon branches in the vibrational spectra of these metals. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the symmetries of the zone-center phonon eigenvectors and predict vibrational fingerprints of the Raman- and infrared-active phonon modes. The analysis of thermodynamic properties reveals the Einstein temperature for CsTi3Te5, CsZr3Te5, and CsHf3Te5 to be 66, 54, and 53 K, respectively. Our orbital-decomposed electronic structure calculations reveal significant in-plane steric interactions and multiple Dirac band crossings near the Fermi level. We further investigate the role of spin-orbit coupling effect on the studied properties. This theoretical investigation sheds light on the intriguing quantum behaviour of kagome metals and provides valuable insights for their potential applications in future technologies.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the structural phase field crystal approach for modeling solid-liquid-vapor phase transformations in pure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent class of phase field crystal (PFC) models, the density order parameter is coupled to powers of its mean field. This effectively introduces a phenomenology of higher-order direct correlation functions acting on long wavelengths, which is required for modelling solid-liquid-vapor systems. The present work generalizes these models by incorporating, into a single-field theory, higher-order direct correlations, systematically constructed in reciprocal space to operate across long {\it and} short wavelengths. The correlation kernels introduced are also readily adaptable to describe distinct crystal structures. We examine the three-phase equilibrium properties and phase diagrams of the proposed model, and reproduce parts of the aluminum phase diagram as an example of its versatile parametrization. We assess the dynamics of the model, showing that it allows robust control of the interface energy between the vapor and condensed phases (liquid and solid). We also examine the dynamics of solid-vapor interfaces over a wide range of parameters and find that dynamical artifacts reported in previous PFC models do not occur in the present formalism. Additionally, we demonstrate the capacity of the proposed formalism for computing complex microstructures and defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, and voids in solid-liquid-vapor systems, all of which are expected to be crucial for investigating rapid solidification processes.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Search for Photostrictive Materials based on a Thermodynamic Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photostriction is a phenomenon that can potentially improve the precision of light-driven actuation, the sensitivity of photodetection, and the efficiency of optical energy harvesting. However, known materials with significant photostriction are limited, and effective guidelines to discover new photostrictive materials are lacking. In this study, we perform a high-throughput computational search for new photostrictive materials based on simple thermodynamic descriptors, namely the band gap pressure and stress coefficients. Using constrained density functional theory simulations, we establish that these descriptors can accurately predict intrinsic photostriction in a wide range of materials. Subsequently, we screen over 4770 stable semiconductors with a band gap below 2 eV from the Materials Project database to search for strongly photostrictive materials. This search identifies PtS$_2$ and Te$_2$I as the most promising ones, with photostriction exceeding 10$^{-4}$ with a moderate photocarrier concentration of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of factors contributing to strong photostriction, including bulk moduli and band-edge orbital interactions. Our results provide physical insights into photostriction of materials and demonstrate the effectiveness of using simple descriptors in high-throughput searches for new functional materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Straintronics and Mechanical Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Quasi-metallic SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are effectively narrow ribbons of 2D materials with atomically precise edges. They are ideal systems to harness quantum transport straintronics (QTS), i.e. using mechanical strain to control quantum transport. Their large subband energy spacing ($\sim$ 0.8 eV) leads to transistors with a single quantum transport channel. We adapt an applied model to study QTS in uniaxially-strained quasi-metallic-SWCNT transistors. The device parameters are based on an existing experimental platform, with channel lengths of $L=$ 50 nm, diameters $d\approx$ 1.5 nm, and strains up to $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}\approx$ 7 $\%$. We demonstrate that the charge carrier's propagation angle $\Theta$ is fully tunable with $\varepsilon_{\text{tot}}$. When $\Theta$ reaches 90$^o$, the conductance $G$ is completely suppressed. A strain-generated band gap can be tuned up to $\approx$ 400 meV. Mechanical strain adds both scalar $\phi_{\varepsilon}$ and vector $\textbf{A}$ gauge potentials to the transistor's Hamiltonian. These potentials create a rich spectrum of quantum interferences in $G$, which can be described as a mechanical Aharonov-Bohm effect. The charge carriers' quantum phase can be controlled by purely mechanical means. For instance, a full 2$\pi$ phase shift can be induced in a (12,9) tube by a 0.7 $\%$ strain change. This work opens opportunities to add quantitative quantum transport strain effects to the tools box of quantum technologies based on 2D materials and their nanotubes.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticle-based hyperthermia has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for treating malignant solid tumors that exhibit resistance to conventional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation. Despite the clinical approval of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) for the adjunct treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, their therapeutic potential is undercut by chemical synthesis-inherent limitations such as low saturation magnetization, superparamagnetic characteristics, and a wide nanoparticle size distribution. Here, we introduce an micromagnetic modelling-based SAF-MDP design with in-plane magnetization, optimized through specific uniaxial anisotropy adjustments to avert the spin-flop phenomenon and eliminate hysteresis-free hard-axis magnetization loops, paired with a mechanofluidic modeling approach to assess the alignment of the SAF-MDP to the applied alternating magnetic field (AMF). Magnetic Force Microscopy characterization provides unprecedented insights into the particle switching behaviour on a single particle scale. This comprehensive strategy spanning micromagnetics and advanced magnetic characterization enables the design of particles with heating efficiencies to approach the theoretical maximum, dictated by the saturation magnetization of the utilized materials and limited solely by the biologically acceptable frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field. Our work not only addresses the limitations encountered by previous methodologies but also sets the stage for the development of advanced SAF-MDP designs and alignment techniques. This opens a new avenue to hyperthermia-based cancer therapy, delineated only by the boundaries of physical laws and biological safety standards.</description>

      <title>Stacking-Dependent Van Hove Singularity Shifts in Three-Dimensional Charge Density Waves of Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium-based kagome systems AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) have emerged as paradigmatic examples exhibiting unconventional charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity linked to van Hove singularities (VHSs). Despite extensive studies, the three-dimensional (3D) nature of CDW states in these systems remains elusive. This study employs first-principles density functional theory and a tight-binding model to investigate the stacking-dependent electronic structures of 3D CDWs in AV$_3$Sb$_5$, emphasizing the significant role of interlayer coupling in behaviors of the VHSs associated with diverse 3D CDW orders. We develop a minimal 3D tight-binding model and present a detailed analysis of band structures and density of states for various 3D CDW stacking configurations, including those with and without a $\pi$-phase shift stacking of the inverse star of David, as well as alternating stacking of the inverse star of David and the star of David. We find that VHSs exist below the Fermi level even in 3D CDWs without $\pi$-phase shift stackings, and that these VHSs shift downward in the $\pi$-phase shift stacking CDW structure, stabilizing the $2\times2\times2$ $\pi$-shifted inverse star of David distortions in alternating vanadium layers as the ground state 3D CDW order of AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our work provides the electronic origin of 3D CDW orders, paving the way for a deeper understanding of CDWs and superconductivity in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of Group-IV--vacancy centers in diamond upon hydrostatic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V($-$) or G4V centers, have received a great attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of the G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180~GPa. The spin-orbit splitting for the electronic ground and excited states and the hyperfine tensors are calculated by means of plane wave supercell density functional theory as unique fingerprints of these defects. To this end, we developed a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with adding hydrostatic pressures where the coupling strength increases from SiV($-$) to PbV($-$). On the other hand, the calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that the operation of PbV($-$) based quantum sensor is limited up to 30~GPa of hydrostatic pressure whereas SnV($-$), GeV($-$) and SiV($-$) remain photostable up to 180~GPa of hydrostatic pressure.</description>

      <title>Itinerant A-type Antiferromagnetic Order in Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the magnetic behavior and resulting transport properties of TaSe$_2$ when intercalated by magnetically active cobalt cations. Acting as the layered host, TaSe$_2$ is a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) that adopts the 2H-polytype. We find through our single crystal and powder diffraction studies that we can prepare the stoichiometry Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$, which crystallizes in the centrosymmetric space group $P6_3/mmc$. From magnetic susceptibility and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, we find a transition consistent with antiferromagnetic order below the temperature $T_N$ = 173 K and Co$^{2+}$ in the high-spin state. Neutron powder diffraction and specific heat measurements, however, point to a much smaller than anticipated ordered moment in this sample. From the neutron results, the magnetic structure can be described as an A-type antiferromagnet with an ordered moment size of 1.35(11) $\mu_B$ per Co cation. The direction of the moments are all long the c-axis, which is consistent with the magnetization and susceptibility studies showing this direction to be the easy axis. Interestingly, we find that a weak and subtle ferromagnetic component appears to exist along the $ab$-plane of the Co$_{0.25}$TaSe$_2$ crystals. We place the results of this work in the context of other magnetic-ion intercalated TMDs, especially those of Ta and Nb.</description>

      <title>Ground State Magnetic Structure and Magnetic Field Effects in the Layered Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbOCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YbOCl is a representative member of the van der Waals layered honeycomb rare-earth chalcohalide REChX (RE = rare earth, Ch = O, S, Se, and Te, and X = F, Cl, Br, and I) family reported recently. Its spin ground state remains to be explored experimentally. In this paper, we have grown high-quality single crystals of YbOCl and conducted comprehensive thermodynamic, elastic, and inelastic neutron scattering experiments down to 50 mK. The experiments reveal an antiferromagnetic phase below 1.3 K, which is identified as a spin ground state with an intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic ordering. By applying sophisticated numerical techniques to a honeycomb (nearest-neighbor)-triangle (next-nearest-neighbor) model Hamiltonian which accurately describes the highly anisotropic spin system, we are able to well simulate the experiments and determine the diagonal and off-diagonal spin-exchange interactions. The simulations give an antiferromagnetic Kitaev term comparable to the Heisenberg one. The experiments under magnetic fields allow us to establish a magnetic field-temperature phase diagram around the spin ground state. Most interestingly, a relatively small magnetic field (~ 0.3 to 3 T) can significantly suppress the antiferromagnetic order, suggesting an intriguing interplay of the Kitaev interaction and magnetic fields in the spin system. The present study provides fundamental insights into the highly anisotropic spin systems and opens a new window to look into Kitaev spin physics in a rare-earth-based system.</description>

      <title>Insulator-Metal Transition and Magnetic Crossover in Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-plane magnetic fields offer a relatively unexplored opportunity to alter the band structure of stacks of 2D materials so that they exhibit desired physical properties. Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with a transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in bilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital magnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the transition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition, switch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of stacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: A scalable platform to synthesize ultrathin heavy metals may enable high efficiency charge-to-spin conversion for next-generation spintronics. Here we report the synthesis of air-stable, epitaxially registered monolayer Pb underneath bilayer graphene on SiC (0001) by confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet). Diffraction, spectroscopy, and microscopy reveal CHet-based Pb intercalation predominantly exhibits a mottled hexagonal superstructure due to an ordered network of Frenkel-Kontorova-like domain walls. The system's air stability enables ex-situ spin torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements that demonstrate charge-to-spin conversion in graphene/Pb/ferromagnet heterostructures with a 1.5x increase in the effective field ratio compared to control samples.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the behaviour of slip bands, terminated mid-grain in the ferrite grains of age-hardened stainless steel, under different conditions to understand their dislocation activity and response to varying loads. The full Nye lattice curvature tensor was measured in situ using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) to estimate the total geometrically necessary dislocation density and individual mobile and immobile dislocations activity at the slip band scale. We found that slip bands primarily consist of edge dislocations, marked by a 'blooming zone' at its tip, indicating significant shear deformation and loss of mobile dislocations. The blooming zone expands as the load increases while the slip band thickness remains constant. Coupled with the correlation between mobile and immobile dislocations within the loaded slip bands observed in situ, we observed that the dislocation activities at the slip band were mainly from immobile edge dislocations to maintain the geometrical distortion of the slip band.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate structural and electronic properties of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic eigenstructures, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase of molybdenene is metallic Dirac material, known as metallic relative of graphene. Partial density of state analysis has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty and being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies or soft modes for both eigenstructures, showing their instability in terms of lattice dynamics, as reported in experimental literature.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation prediction with a dual-solute model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solute segregation along grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly affects their thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in polycrystalline materials. Recently, the spectral approach has emerged as a powerful tool to predict GB segregation. However, previous GB segregation predictions using this method relied heavily on single-solute segregation energy spectrum without solute-solute interactions, which were often incorporated through a fitting parameter. In this work, we developed a dual-solute model whose segregation energy spectrum intrinsically incorporates solute-solute interactions. It was first validated for GB segregation prediction in the Al-Mg system and then extended to several other distinct binary alloy systems. The dual-solute model shows significant improvement over the single-solute model and can accurately predict the real segregation states obtained by hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations within a broad temperature range with different solute concentrations before forming secondary phases. This dual-solute model provides an effective method for accurately predicting GB segregation in nanocrystalline metals.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers promising new approaches to tackle complex problems and has been increasingly adopted in chemical and materials sciences. Broadly speaking, ML models employ generic mathematical functions and attempt to learn essential physics and chemistry from a large amount of data. Consequently, because of the limited physical or chemical principles in the functional form, the reliability of the predictions is oftentimes not guaranteed, particularly for data far out of distribution. It is critical to quantify the uncertainty in model predictions and understand how the uncertainty propagates to downstream chemical and materials applications. Herein, we review existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) and uncertainty propagation (UP) methods for atomistic ML under a united framework of probabilistic modeling. We first categorize the UQ methods, with the aim to elucidate the similarities and differences between them. We also discuss performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy, precision, calibration, and efficiency of the UQ methods and techniques for model recalibration. With these metrics, we survey existing benchmark studies of the UQ methods using molecular and materials datasets. Furthermore, we discuss UP methods to propagate the uncertainty obtained from ML models in widely used materials and chemical simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling. We also provide remarks on the challenges and future opportunities of UQ and UP in atomistic ML.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the magnetization dynamics in spin textures, particularly skyrmions, offer promising new directions for magnetic storage technologies and spintronics. Skyrmions, characterized by their topological protection and efficient mobility at low current density, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications in next-generation logic and memory devices. This study investigates the dynamics of skyrmion magnetization, focusing on the manipulation of their topological states as a basis for bitwise data storage through a modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG). We introduce spin-polarized electrons from a topological ferromagnet that induce an electric dipole moment that interacts with the electric gauge field within the skyrmion domain. This interaction creates an effective magnetic field that results in a torque that can dynamically change the topological state of the skyrmion. In particular, we show that these torques can selectively destroy and create skyrmions, effectively writing and erasing bits, highlighting the potential of using controlled electron injection for robust and scalable skyrmion-based data storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium States and Interactions in the Topological Insulator and Topological Crystalline Insulator Phases of NaCd4As3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological materials are of great interest because they can support metallic edge or surface states that are robust against perturbations, with the potential for technological applications. Here we experimentally explore the light-induced non-equilibrium properties of two distinct topological phases in NaCd4As3: a topological crystalline insulator (TCI) phase and a topological insulator (TI) phase. This material has surface states that are protected by mirror symmetry in the TCI phase at room temperature, while it undergoes a structural phase transition to a TI phase below 200 K. After exciting the TI phase by an ultrafast laser pulse, we observe a leading band edge shift of &gt;150 meV, that slowly builds up and reaches a maximum after ~0.6 ps, and that persists for ~8 ps. The slow rise time of the excited electron population and electron temperature suggests that the electronic and structural orders are strongly coupled in this TI phase. It also suggests that the directly excited electronic states and the probed electronic states are weakly coupled. Both couplings are likely due to a partial relaxation of the lattice distortion, which is known to be associated with the TI phase. In contrast, no distinct excited state is observed in the TCI phase immediately or after photoexcitation, which we attribute to the low density of states and phase space available near the Fermi level. Our results show how ultrafast laser excitation can reveal the distinct excited states and interactions in phase-rich topological materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-Separated Charge Order and Twinning Across Length Scales in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

Abstract: We present X-ray scattering studies resolving structural twinning and phase separation in the charge density wave (CDW) state of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. The three-dimensional CDW state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is reported to form a complex superposition of Star of David (SoD) or Tri-Hexagonal (TrH) patterns of distortion within its kagome planes, but the out-of-plane stacking is marked by metastability. In order to resolve the impact of this metastability, we present reciprocal space mapping and real-space images of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ collected across multiple length scales using temperature-dependent high-dynamic range mapping (HDRM) and dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). The experimental data provide evidence for a rich microstructure that forms in the CDW state. Data evidence metastability in the formation of $2\times 2\times 4$ and $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW supercells dependent on thermal history and mechanical deformation. We further directly resolve the real space phase segregation of both supercells as well as a real-space, structural twinning driven by the broken rotational symmetry of the CDW state. Our combined results provide insights into the role of microstructure and twinning in experiments probing the electronic properties of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ where rotational symmetry is broken by the three-dimensional charge density wave order but locally preserved for any single kagome layer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02158v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stable or metastable crystal structures of assembled atoms can be predicted by finding the global or local minima of the energy surface within a broad space of atomic configurations. Generally, this requires repeated first-principles energy calculations, which is often impractical for large crystalline systems. Here, we present significant progress toward solving the crystal structure prediction problem: we performed noniterative, single-shot screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures with a machine-learning energy predictor. This shotgun method (ShotgunCSP) has two key technical components: transfer learning for accurate energy prediction of pre-relaxed crystalline states, and two generative models based on element substitution and symmetry-restricted structure generation to produce promising and diverse crystal structures. First-principles calculations were performed only to generate the training samples and to refine a few selected pre-relaxed crystal structures. The ShotunCSP method is computationally less intensive than conventional methods and exhibits exceptional prediction accuracy, reaching 93.3% in benchmark tests with 90 different crystal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous materials research labs require the ability to combine and learn from diverse data streams. This is especially true for learning material synthesis-process-structure-property relationships, key to accelerating materials optimization and discovery as well as accelerating mechanistic understanding. We present the Synthesis-process-structure-property relAtionship coreGionalized lEarner (SAGE) algorithm. A fully Bayesian algorithm that uses multimodal coregionalization to merge knowledge across data sources to learn synthesis-process-structure-property relationships. SAGE outputs a probabilistic posterior for the relationships including the most likely relationships given the data.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>
