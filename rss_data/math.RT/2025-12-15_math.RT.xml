      <title>On framed rook algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the framed rook algebra, a structure that unifies two significant generalizations of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The first one, introduced by Solomon, extends the Hecke algebra to the full matrix monoid, yielding the rook monoid algebra. The second one, developed by Yokonuma, replaces the Borel subgroup with the unipotent subgroup, resulting in the Yokonuma-Hecke algebra. Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be an associative ring with identity. We introduce an equivalence relation on the class of Wakamatsu tilting right R modules. By using this equivalence relation, we extend the Mantese Reiten theorems from the setting of Artin algebras to that of arbitrary associative rings.</description>

      <title>Quotient branching laws and Gan-Gross-Prasad relevance for general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves the branching laws for the full class of unitarizable representations of general linear groups in non-Archimedean local fields, extending the original notion of Gan-Gross-Prasad relevant pair for Arthur-type representations \cite{GGP2, Gur, Cha_crelle}. Further, we provide an explicit computable algorithm to determine the generalized GGP relevant pair, as developed in \cite{Cha_qbl}. In particular, we show that if $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are any irreducible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL_{n+1}(F)}$ and $\mathrm{GL_{n}(F)}$ respectively, and their Langlands data or Zelevinsky data are given in terms of multisegments, then through an algorithmic process we can determine whether the space $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{GL_n(F)}}(\pi, \pi')$ is non-zero. Finally, when one of the represntations $\pi$ and $ \pi'$ is a generalized Speh representation, we give a complete classification for the other one for which the Hom space is non-zero.</description>

      <title>Stratification of the Helffer-Nourrigat cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a singular filtration on a manifold, e.g. a subriemannian setting, one can understand the elliptic regularity problems through a special kind of calculus. The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the 2-representation theory of the odd one-dimensional super Lie algebra $gl(1|1)^+$ and show it controls the Heegaard-Floer theory of surfaces of Lipshitz, Ozsv\'ath and Thurston. Our main tool is the construction of a tensor product for 2-representations. We show it corresponds to a gluing operation for surfaces, or the chord diagrams of arc decompositions. This provides an extension of Heegaard-Floer theory to dimension one, expanding the work of Douglas, Lipshitz and Manolescu.</description>

      <title>A$_\infty$ deformations of extended Khovanov arc algebras and Stroppel's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended Khovanov arc algebras $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ are graded associative algebras which naturally appear in a variety of contexts, from knot and link homology, low-dimensional topology and topological quantum field theory to representation theory and symplectic geometry. C. Stroppel conjectured in her ICM 2010 address that the bigraded Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathrm{K}_m^n$ vanish in a certain range, implying that the algebras $\mathrm K_m^n$ admit no nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations, in particular that the algebras are intrinsically formal.
  Whereas Stroppel's Conjecture is known to hold for the algebras $\mathrm K_m^1$ and $\mathrm K_1^n$ by work of Seidel and Thomas, we show that $\mathrm K_m^n$ does in fact admit nontrivial A$_\infty$ deformations with nonvanishing higher products for all $m, n \geq 2$.
  We describe both $\mathrm K_m^n$ and its Koszul dual concretely as path algebras of quivers with relations and give an explicit algebraic construction of A$_\infty$ deformations of $\mathrm K_m^n$ by using the correspondence between A$_\infty$ deformations of a Koszul algebra and filtered associative deformations of its Koszul dual. These deformations can also be viewed as A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya--Seidel categories associated to Hilbert schemes of surfaces based on recent work of Mak and Smith.</description>

      <title>Higher Auslander Algebras arising from Dynkin Quivers and n-Representation Finite Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the derived category of mod-KQ for Dynkin quiver Q, we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $3k+2$ for any $k\geq 1$. Furthermore, we extend this construction for higher analogues of representation finite and hereditary algebras. Specifically, if $M$ is an n-cluster tilting object in the bounded derived category of n-representation finite and n-hereditary algebra, then we construct a full subcategory in a canonical way, so that its endomorphism algebra is a higher Auslander algebra of global dimension $(n+2)k+n+1$ for any $k\geq 1$.
  As an application, we revisit the higher Auslander correspondence. Firstly, we describe the corresponding module categories that have higher cluster-tilting objects, and then we discuss their relationship with certain full subcategories of the derived category. Consequently, we obtain a vast list of n-representation finite n-hereditary algebras whose n-cluster tilting objects are always minimal generator-cogenerator. Moreover, resulting algebras can be realized as endomorphism algebras of certain full subcategories of (higher) cluster categories.</description>

      <title>The relatively universal cover of the natural embedding of the long root geometry for the group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. V\"{o}lklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The "if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by V\"{o}lklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. V\"{o}lklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p &gt; 0$). Accordingly, both the "if" and the "only if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>The trace formula of GL(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trace formula constitutes a fundamental tool in the Langlands program. In general, Arthur introduced a truncation operator to render both the geometric and spectral sides of the formula convergent. This paper focuses on the case of $\mathrm{GL}(3)$. We first prove that the divergent terms on the geometric and spectral sides are equal, leading to their cancellation. We derive an explicit formula for ramified orbital integrals, showing they are limits of unramified ones and that Arthur's definition yields a universal object, agreeing with that of Hoffmann-Wakatsuki. Finally, on the spectral side, we apply normalized intertwining operators to present the expansion in a form parallel to that of the geometric side.</description>

      <title>Spaces of states of the two-dimensional O(n) and Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the spaces of states of the two-dimensional $O(n)$ and $Q$-state Potts models with generic parameters $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ as representations of their known symmetry algebras. While the relevant representations of the conformal algebra were recently worked out, it remained to determine the action of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model.
  We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus partition functions of the models at criticality. The twist in question is the insertion of a group element along one cycle of the torus: this breaks modular invariance, but allows the partition function to have a unique decomposition into characters of irreducible representations of the global symmetry group.
  Our second method reduces the problem to determining branching rules of certain diagram algebras. For the $O(n)$ model, we decompose representations of the Brauer algebra into representations of its unoriented Jones--Temperley--Lieb subalgebra. For the $Q$-state Potts model, we decompose representations of the partition algebra into representations of the appropriate subalgebra. We find explicit expressions for these decompositions as sums over certain sets of diagrams, and over standard Young tableaux.
  We check that both methods agree in many cases. Moreover, our spaces of states are consistent with recent bootstrap results on four-point functions of the corresponding CFTs.</description>

Abstract: By using Ikeda's theory for a compatible family of Eisenstein series, we explicitly construct Ikeda type lifts on the special orthogonal group $G=\SO(3,n+1)$ over $\Q$ with $n\ge 3$ which splits everywhere at finite places. Our lifts are Hecke eigen cusp forms of weight $l$ ($l\ge n+2$, even) and come from elliptic newforms with respect to $\SL_2(\Z)$ which are of weight $l-\frac{n-2}{2}$ when $n$ is even and
  $2l-n+1$ when $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Structural and Classification Theorems for Weyl-Type Algebras over Expolynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically studies Weyl-type, Witt-type, and non-associative algebras defined over expolynomial rings -- commutative rings generated by exponential functions $e^{\alpha x}$, exponentials of exponentials $e^{\pm x^p e^{t}}$, and power functions $x^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha$ in an additive subgroup $\cA$ of a characteristic zero field $\FF$. We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\ZZ \subseteq \cB \subseteq \cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\Weyl{e^{\pm x^p e^{t}},\; e^{\cA x},\; x^{\cA}} \rtimes \FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.</description>
