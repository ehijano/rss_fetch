      <title>Coupled transport equations with freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of two coupled transport equations with freezing. The solutions freeze in time when they are equal. We prove existence and uniqueness of continuous solutions if the initial conditions are continuous. We discuss several qualitative and quantitative properties of the solutions. The equations arise in a model for collisions of a large number of tightly spaced balls.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

      <title>An Existence Theorem for a Model of Temperature Within a Lithium-Ion Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate a model for the temperature within a Lithium-Ion battery. The model takes the form of a parabolic PDE for the temperature coupled with two elliptic PDE's for the electric potential within the solid and electrolyte phases. The primary difficulty comes from the coupling term, which is given by the Butler-Volmer equation. It features an exponential nonlinearity of both the electric potentials and the reciprocal of the temperature. Another difficulty arising in the temperature equation are the gradients of the electric potentials squared showing up on the right-hand side. Due to the nonlinearity, meaningful estimates for the temperature are currently not known. In spite of this, our investigation reveals the local existence of continuous temperature for the Lithium-Ion Battery.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the number of relevant considerations in the literature, the algebra of generalized symmetries of the Burgers equation has not been exhaustively described. We fill this gap, presenting a basis of this algebra in an explicit form and proving that the two well-known recursion operators of the Burgers equation and two seed generalized symmetries, which are evolution forms of its Lie symmetries, suffice to generate this algebra. The core of the proof is essentially simplified by using the original technique of choosing special coordinates in the associated jet space.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-norms for the homogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a priori estimates showing the propagation and generation of $L^p$-norms for solutions to the non-cutoff spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with soft potentials. The singularity of the collision kernel is key to generate regularization and inhomogeneity in the energy estimates of the $L^p$-norms. Our result extends \cite{Alo19} from the hard potential cases to the soft ones.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Limit of the One-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann System for Cutoff Hard Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive limit of the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system in perturbation framework still remains unsolved, due to the weaker time decay rate compared with the two-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system. By employing the weighted energy method with two newly introduced weight functions and some novel treatments, we solve this problem for the full range of cutoff hard potentials $0\leq \gamma \leq 1$. Uniform estimate with respect to the Knudsen number $\varepsilon\in (0,1]$ is established globally in time, which eventually leads to the global existence of solutions to the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system and hydrodynamic limit to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-Maxwell system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on diffusive limit of the one-species Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system in perturbation framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The micropolar fluid system is a model based on the Navier-Stokes equations which considers two coupled variables: the velocity field $\vec u$ and the microrotation field $\vec\omega$. Assuming an additional condition over the variable $\vec u$ we will first prove that weak solutions $(\vec u, \vec\omega)$ of this system are smooth. Then, we will present a concentration effect of the $L^3_x$ norm of the velocity field $\vec u$ near a possible singular time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a parameter dependent periodic-logistic problem with a logistic term involving a degeneracy that replicates time dependent refuges in the habitat of a population. Working under no or very minimal assumptions on the boundary regularity of the domain we show the existence of a time-periodic solution which bifurcates with respect to the parameter and show their stability. We show that under suitable assumptions that the periodic solution blows up on part of the domain and remains finite on other parts when the parameter approaches a critical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the exceptional set of the boundary for the following problem: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathcal{M}_{\lambda,\Lambda}^+(D^2u) + b(x,t)\cdot Du + c(x,t)u =0 \quad \rm{in} ~ \Omega_{T}, \end{aligned} \end{equation*} We provide a sufficient condition on the exceptional set in terms of the bound of the Hausdorff measure of this boundary portion. This condition ensures that even if the boundary values are not nonnegative on this portion, the supersolution remains nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Concentration bounds for stochastic systems with singular kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is concerned with weakly interacting stochastic particle systems with possibly singular pairwise interactions. In this setting, we observe a connection between entropic propagation of chaos and exponential concentration bounds for the empirical measure of the system. In particular, we establish a variational upper bound for the probability of a certain rare event, and then use this upper bound to show that "controlled" entropic propagation of chaos implies an exponential concentration bound for the empirical measure. This connection allows us to infer concentration bounds for a class of singular stochastic systems through a simple adaptation of the arguments developed in Jabin and Wang (2018).</description>

      <title>Collapse of the Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models on the infinite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\Phi^3_2$-measure in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant measure for several stochastic partial differential equations including the parabolic and hyperbolic $\Phi^3_2$-models. In the large torus limit, we observe a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around zero, which is the single minimizer of the corresponding Hamiltonian for any fixed torus size. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we obtain a triviality result for the $\Phi^3_2$-measure on infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces for the Laplacian on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Laplace operator on the half-space with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that this operator admits a bounded $H^\infty$-calculus on Sobolev spaces with power weights measuring the distance to the boundary. These weights do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. We additionally study the corresponding Dirichlet and Neumann heat semigroup. It is shown that these semigroups, in contrast to the $L^p$-case, have polynomial growth. Moreover, maximal regularity results for the heat equation are derived on inhomogeneous and homogeneous weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Fredholm backstepping for critical operators and application to rapid stabilization for the linearized water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fredholm-type backstepping transformation, introduced by Coron and L\"u, has become a powerful tool for rapid stabilization with fast development over the last decade. Its strength lies in its systematic approach, allowing to deduce rapid stabilization from approximate controllability. But limitations with the current approach exist for operators of the form $|D_x|^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in (1,3/2]$. We present here a new compactness/duality method which hinges on Fredholm's alternative to overcome the $\alpha=3/2$ threshold. More precisely, the compactness/duality method allows to prove the existence of a Riesz basis for the backstepping transformation for skew-adjoint operator verifying $\alpha&gt;1$, a key step in the construction of the Fredholm backstepping transformation, where the usual methods only work for $\alpha&gt;3/2$. The illustration of this new method is shown on the rapid stabilization of the linearized capillary-gravity water wave equation exhibiting an operator of critical order $\alpha=3/2$.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics for a complex cubic Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem of the following complex cubic Camassa-Holm (ccCH) equation $$m_{t}=b u_{x}+\frac{1}{2}\left[m\left(|u|^{2}-\left|u_{x}\right|^{2}\right)\right]_{x}-\frac{1}{2} m\left(u \bar{u}_{x}-u_{x} \bar{u}\right), \quad m=u-u_{x x},$$ where $b&gt;0$ is an arbitrary positive real constant. Long-time asymptotics of the equation is obtained through the $\bar{\partial}$-steepest descent method. Firstly, based on the spectral analysis of the Lax pair and scattering matrix, the solution of the equation is able to be constructed via solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem. Then, we present different long time asymptotic expansions of the solution $u(y,t)$ in different space-time solitonic regions of $\xi=y/t$. The half-plane ${(y,t):-\infty &lt;y&lt; \infty, t &gt; 0}$ is divided into four asymptotic regions: $\xi \in(-\infty,-1)$, $\xi \in (-1,0)$, $\xi \in (0,\frac{1}{8})$ and $\xi \in (\frac{1}{8},+\infty)$. When $\xi$ falls in $(-\infty,-1)\cup (\frac{1}{8},+\infty)$, no stationary phase point of the phase function $\theta(z)$ exists on the jump profile in the space-time region. In this case, corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N(\Lambda)$-solitons with diverse residual error order $O(t^{-1+2\varepsilon})$. There are four stationary phase points and eight stationary phase points on the jump curve as $\xi \in (-1,0)$ and $\xi \in (0,\frac{1}{8})$, respectively. The corresponding asymptotic form is accompanied by a residual error order $O(t^{-\frac{3}{4}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Brezis-Nirenberg type problems, governed by the double phase operator $- \mathrm{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\, \nabla u + a(x)\, |\nabla u|^{q-2}\, \nabla u\right)$, that involve a critical nonlinearity of the form $|u|^{p^\ast - 2}\, u + b(x)\, |u|^{q^\ast - 2}\, u$. Both for the local case and for related nonlocal Kirchhoff type problems, we prove new compactness and existence results using variational methods in suitable Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces. For these functional spaces, we prove some continuous and compact embeddings that are of independent interest. The study of the local problem is complemented by some nonexistence results of Poho\v{z}aev type.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Classical Two-Phase Flows of Viscous Incompressible Fluids by a Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show convergence of the Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system to a classical sharp interface model for the two-phase flow of two viscous incompressible fluids with same viscosities in a smooth bounded domain in two and three space dimensions as long as a smooth solution of the limit system exists. Moreover, we obtain error estimates with the aid of a relative entropy method. Our results hold provided that the mobility $m_\varepsilon&gt;0$ in the Allen-Cahn equation tends to zero in a subcritical way, i.e., $m_\varepsilon= m_0 \varepsilon^\beta$ for some $\beta\in (0,2)$ and $m_0&gt;0$. The proof proceeds by showing via a relative entropy argument that the solution to the Navier-Stokes/Allen-Cahn system remains close to the solution of a perturbed version of the two-phase flow problem, augmented by an extra mean curvature flow term $m_\varepsilon H_{\Gamma_t}$ in the interface motion. In a second step, it is easy to see that the solution to the perturbed problem is close to the original two-phase flow.</description>

      <title>Permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation. We show that the dynamics of these solutions can be reduced to an evolution equation on a single vorticity component $\omega_1$, and we characterize the relevant constraint space for this vorticity component under permutation symmetry. We also give single vorticity component versions of the energy equality, Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, and local wellposedness theory that are specific to the permutation symmetric case. This paper is significantly motivated by a recent work of the author, which proved finite-time blowup for smooth solutions of a Fourier-restricted Euler model equation, where the Helmholtz projection is replaced by a projection onto a more restrictive constraint space. The blowup solutions for this model equation are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0.$ Using the blowup solution introduced by Elgindi, we are able to prove there are $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions of the full Euler equation that blowup in finite-time, which are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$.</description>

      <title>Complex pattern formation governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-Swift-Hohenberg system: Analysis and numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Cahn-Hilliard-Swift-Hohenberg system, focusing on a three-species chemical mixture subject to physical constraints on volume fractions. The resulting system leads to complex patterns involving a separation into phases as typical of the Cahn-Hilliard equation and small scale stripes and dots as seen in the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We introduce singular potentials of logarithmic type to enhance the model's accuracy in adhering to essential physical constraints. The paper establishes the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions within this extended framework. The insights gained contribute to a deeper understanding of phase separation in complex systems, with potential applications in materials science and related fields. We introduce a stable finite element approximation based on an obstacle formulation. Subsequent numerical simulations demonstrate that the model allows for complex structures as seen in pigment patterns of animals and in porous polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Hadamard variation of eigenvalues with respect to general domain perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hadamard variation of eigenvalues of Laplacian with respect to general domain perturbations. We show their existence up to the second order rigorously and characterize the derivatives, using associated eigenvalue problems in finite dimensional spaces. Then smooth rearrangement of multiple eigenvalues is explicitly given. This result follows from an abstract theory, applicable to general perturbations of symmetric bilinear forms.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of static and dynamic weak optimal transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a PDE formulation in terms of Fokker-Planck equations for weak optimal transport problems. The main novelty is that we introduce a minimization problem involving Fokker-Planck equations in the extended sense of measure-valued solutions and prove that it is equal to the associated weak transport problem.</description>

      <title>Numerical spectral analysis of standing waves in quantum hydrodynamics with viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the linearization around standing wave profiles for two quantum hydrodynamics systems with linear and nonlinear viscosity. The essential spectrum for such profiles is stable; we investigate the point spectrum using an Evans function technique. For both systems we show numerically that there exists a real unstable eigenvalue, thus providing numerical evidence for spectral instability.</description>
