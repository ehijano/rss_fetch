      <title>Testing maximum entropy models with e-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-values have recently emerged as a robust and flexible alternative to p-values for hypothesis testing, especially under optional continuation, i.e., when additional data from further experiments are collected. In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.</description>

      <title>Double Descent and Overparameterization in Particle Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the benefit of heavily overparameterized models has been observed in machine learning tasks: models with enough capacity to easily cross the \emph{interpolation threshold} improve in generalization error compared to the classical bias-variance tradeoff regime. We demonstrate this behavior for the first time in particle physics data and explore when and where `double descent' appears and under which circumstances overparameterization results in a performance gain.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Applicability of Emulated Virtual Circuits for Tokamak Plasma Shape Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Amp\`eres, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Inference of epidemic networks: the effect of different data types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions rather than static links. These links may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes -an inhomogeneous Poisson or a Hawkes process- and a static maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree/unique-edge expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of a log-linear Hawkes/NHPP intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting inhomogeneous Poisson modeling -e.g. Hawkes models- to MaxEnt network ensembles. Global Hawkes time layers consistently improve log-likelihood over generic NHPP, while the MaxEnt edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this unified framework and how it could be integrated with calibrated community/motif tools, Hawkes calibration procedures, and (neural) kernel estimation.</description>

      <title>Estimate of the exit time for the Long Range Ising model on random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the metastable behavior of the long-range Ising model on random regular graphs under Glauber dynamics at low-temperature. We estimate the energy barrier and exit time from the metastable state using a nontrivial path-wise approach that explicitly accounts for the spatial decay of the interactions and the structural properties of the graph, such as the Cheeger constant and known estimates of the diameter. Our results generalize those of Dommers \cite{dommers2017metastability} for the short-range case, providing a unified framework for understanding metastability in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Fisher information flow in artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate- and Extremely High-Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- to 5+ and 6- to 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm that emphasizes input parameters with the highest variance during training and identifies the most significant ones influencing the outputs based on a computed metric called "potentiality". We focus on the dependence of solar wind plasma density on moderate-geomagnetic conditions. It has been unclear from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL extracted solar wind velocity as the predominant parameter at extremely low (0 to 1+) and high-Kp ranges under southward IMF. In this study, the IMF three components, solar wind speed, and plasma density from the OMNI database (1998-2019), covering solar cycle 23 to early 25, were used as inputs. Again, PL selected solar wind velocity as the most significant parameter for moderate and extremely high Kp. The potentiality of solar wind density for these ranges was, however, 3.5 times higher than in the previous study, suggesting its impact on geomagnetic activity cannot be ignored. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as PL inputs under all Kp levels. Above moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind if density is large, suggesting that not only velocity but also density contributes significantly. These PL and statistical investigations show that solar wind density begins to regulate Kp above moderate geomagnetic activity under southward IMF. They also help understand the relationship between solar wind and geomagnetic activity and forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>

      <title>LArTPC hit-based topology classification with quantum machine learning and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12655v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to separate track-like and shower-like topologies in liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) experiments for neutrino physics using quantum machine learning. Effective reconstruction of neutrino events in LArTPCs requires accurate and granular information about the energy deposited in the detector. These energy deposits can be viewed as 2-D images. Simulated data from the MicroBooNE experiment and a simple custom dataset are used to perform pixel-level classification of the underlying particle topology. Images of the events have been studied by creating small patches around each pixel to characterise its topology based on its immediate neighbourhood. This classification is achieved using convolution-based learning models, including quantum-enhanced architectures known as quanvolutional neural networks. The quanvolutional networks are extended to symmetries beyond translation. Rotational symmetry has been incorporated into a subset of the models. Quantum-enhanced models perform better than their classical counterparts with a comparable number of parameters but are outperformed by classical models, which contain an order of magnitude more parameters. The inclusion of rotation symmetry appears to benefit only large models and remains to be explored further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In collider physics, experiments are often based on counting the numbers of events in bins of a histogram. We present a new way to build and analyze statistical models that describe these experiments, based on the probabilistic programming language Stan and the HistFactory specification. A command-line tool transpiles HistFactory models into Stan code and data files. Because Stan is an imperative language, it enables richer and more detailed modeling, as modeling choices defined in the HistFactory declarative specification can be tweaked and adapted in the Stan language. Stan was constructed with automatic differentiation, allowing modern computational algorithms for sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic characterization of turbulence intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an information-theoretic characterization of small-scale intermittency in turbulent flows, that distinguishes turbulence-induced intermittency from purely kinematic effects. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to quantify the deviation of pseudodissipation, dissipation or enstrophy of a turbulent flow field from that of a Gaussian random velocity field, serving as a comprehensive measure of the small-scale intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics. Shannon entropy is employed to evaluate the uncertainty of these small-scale quantities. Analysis of direct numerical simulation data of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow across a wide range of Taylor Reynolds numbers demonstrates the existence of two critical Reynolds numbers where the variation of uncertainty changes. The study reveals a new scaling behavior and presence of a symmetry: (i) turbulence-induced intermittency grows logarithmically with Reynolds number unlike the commonly reported power-law scaling and (ii) turbulence dynamics produce equal intermittency in both dissipation rate and enstrophy, in contrast to the prevailing assumptions of asymmetry in strain-rate and vorticity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Novel techniques of imaging interferometry analysis to study gas and plasma density for laser-plasma experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma based experiments are always more demanding about the plasma features which need to be generated during the interaction. This is valid for laser-plasma acceleration as well as for inertial confinement fusion experiments. Most of these experiments are moving toward high repetition rate operation regimes, making even more demanding the requests on the plasma sources and the diagnostics to be implemented.
  Interferometry is one of the most used methods to characterize these sources, since it allows for non-perturbative, single-shot measurements either of the neutral gas or the plasma density. The design of the interferometric setup is non-trivial and needs to be shaped on the actual conditions of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the raw data is a complex task, prone to many sources of error and dependent on the manual inputs.
  In this work, we will present the techniques we are developing for the analysis of the interferograms to measure both the gas and plasma density. We will show the methods, the progress and the problems we encountered in the development of novel routines of analysis based on machine learning. The architectures and the methods to obtain data used for training and testing them will be introduced. The study is ongoing and preliminary results with synthetic data will be presented. The goal is to set up a fast and operator independent diagnostic for the feedback of plasma sources toward high repetition rate experiments.</description>

      <title>Dichography: Two-frame Ultrafast Imaging from a Single Diffraction Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</description>
