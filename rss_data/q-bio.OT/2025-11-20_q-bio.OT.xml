      <title>Efficient Constraining of Transcoding in DNA-Based Image Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA has emerged as a promising alternative for long-term data storage due to its high capacity, durability, and low-energy potential. However, storing data in DNA presents several challenges. First, it requires complex and costly biochemical processes, making efficient compression crucial to reducing DNA synthesis time and cost. Second, these processes are prone to errors that must be avoided and/or corrected. In particular, homopolymers (repetitions of the same nucleotide) are a wellknown source of errors during the sequencing step. Avoiding such repetitions helps mitigate errors but introduces a constraint that may increase the data compression rate. In this paper, we propose two transcoding methods that address these two key challenges: reducing data rate and minimizing errors. The first method strictly enforces the error-minimization constraint by eliminating homopolymers of a certain length, at the cost of an increased data rate. In contrast, the second method accepts a slight increase in homopolymers. However, we show that these increases remain limited (2.14% increase in compression rate for the first method and 0.39% homopolymer rate for the second). These two approaches demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently constrain transcoding while balancing error minimization and compression performance.</description>

      <title>XGBoost-Powered Digital Twins Leverage Routine Blood Tests for Early Detection of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of cancer and cardiovascular diseases is fundamental to improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare expenditure. Current cancer screening programs are targeted towards specific cancers and are often inaccessible to large parts of the population, particularly in remote regions. This project aimed to develop digital blood twins: machine learning models that leverage routinely collected blood test data, demographics, comorbidities, and prescribed medications, for scalable and cost-effective disease screening. Digital blood twins were constructed using the UK Biobank dataset (n = 373,269). Using age, sex, comorbidities, medication profiles, and blood test z-scores, three iterations of XGBoost classifiers were trained for broad cancer, colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular disease prediction. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP and dimensionality reduction analyses (UMAP, t-SNE). Broad-category cancer models achieved ROC-AUC = 0.607-0.706. Colorectal cancer prediction demonstrated excellent discrimination (ROC-AUC = 0.816-0.993), and cardiovascular models showed clinical utility, notably for hypertension (ROC-AUC = 0.813, F1 = 0.861). SHAP revealed consistent importance of age, sex, basophil count, and cystatin C. Immune digital blood twins as an agnostic tool demonstrate proof-of-concept feasibility for accessible, low-cost, and scalable screening of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, supporting future integration into predictive and preventive healthcare.</description>

      <title>From Longitudinal Disease Signatures to Model-driven Disease Networks for Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gradually integrated within healthcare systems, permitting the enhancement of clinical decision-making through the automation of diagnostics and the synthesization of patient information, and improving. The integration of AI into healthcare systems has introduced novel methods for enhancing clinical decision-making, automating diagnostics, and synthesizing patient information. However, the complex dynamic nature of diseases, and the necessity for explainable reasoning have created demand for approaches that can transform large amounts of complex clinical data into actionable, interpretable knowledge. This work introduces a model-driven framework based on disease patterns converted into correlation graphs for causal exploration. We created a repository of 105 typical disease signatures from common blood markers to build a systematic pipeline to translate multidimensional clinical time series data into intervenable disease networks for causal discovery and causal analysis.</description>
