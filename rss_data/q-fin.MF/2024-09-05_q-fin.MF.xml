      <title>Robust Time-inconsistent Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Controls: A Stochastic Differential Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies robust time-inconsistent (TIC) linear-quadratic stochastic control problems, formulated by stochastic differential games. By a spike variation approach, we derive sufficient conditions for achieving the Nash equilibrium, which corresponds to a time-consistent (TC) robust policy, under mild technical assumptions. To illustrate our framework, we consider two scenarios of robust mean-variance analysis, namely with state- and control-dependent ambiguity aversion. We find numerically that with time inconsistency haunting the dynamic optimal controls, the ambiguity aversion enhances the effective risk aversion faster than the linear, implying that the ambiguity in the TIC cases is more impactful than that under the TC counterparts, e.g., expected utility maximization problems.</description>

      <title>Perpetual Futures Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perpetual futures are contracts without expiration date in which the anchoring of the futures price to the spot price is ensured by periodic funding payments from long to short. We derive explicit expressions for the no-arbitrage price of various perpetual contracts, including linear, inverse, and quantos futures in both discrete and continuous-time. In particular, we show that the futures price is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the spot sampled at a random time that reflects the intensity of the price anchoring. Furthermore, we identify funding specifications that guarantee the coincidence of futures and spot prices, and show that for such specifications perpetual futures contracts can be replicated by dynamic trading in primitive securities.</description>

      <title>Price-mediated contagion with endogenous market liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Price-mediated contagion occurs when a positive feedback loop develops following a drop in asset prices which forces banks and other financial institutions to sell their holdings. Prior studies of such events fix the level of market liquidity without regards to the level of stress applied to the system. This paper introduces a framework to understand price-mediated contagion in a system where the capacity of the market to absorb liquidated assets is determined endogenously. In doing so, we construct a joint clearing system in interbank payments, asset prices, and market liquidity. We establish mild assumptions which guarantee the existence of greatest and least clearing solutions. We conclude with detailed numerical case studies which demonstrate the, potentially severe, repercussions of endogenizing the market liquidity on system risk.</description>
