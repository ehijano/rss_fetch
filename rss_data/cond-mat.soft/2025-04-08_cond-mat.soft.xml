      <title>Contact theorems for electrolyte-filled hollow charged nanoparticles: Non-linear osmotic pressure in confined electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical expressions for the osmotic pressure of electrolytes confined within electrolyte-filled, hollow, charged nanoparticles are studied using contact theorems for cavity nanoshells immersed in a low-concentration electrolyte. Three shell geometries are considered: planar, cylindrical, and spherical. The nanoparticles are modeled as charged cavities of internal radius R and wall thickness d, and are assumed to be at infinite dilution in the surrounding bulk electrolyte. Numerical calculations of the osmotic pressure are presented as a function of several model parameters. For cylindrical and spherical shells, the osmotic pressure exhibits absolute maxima as a function of shell size. This behavior arises from the competition between the violation of the local electroneutrality condition (VLEC) within the shell cavity and the nonlinear profile of the effective electric field. In contrast, the osmotic pressure of the planar (slit-shell) geometry is a monotonic, nonlinear, decreasing function of cavity width. The results are analyzed in terms of the steric and electrostatic (Maxwell stress tensor) contributions appearing in the corresponding contact theorems. Because the analysis is restricted to low surface charge densities and low electrolyte concentrations, the electric double layers (EDLs) inside and outside the shells are obtained from analytical solutions of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We report two novel phenomena: confinement charge reversal (CCR) and confinement overcharging (CO). These arise naturally from the topology of the system. By construction, the confined and bulk electrolytes are maintained at the same chemical potential. These findings have implications for the design of synthetic nanocapsules and ion-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Parameter-Controlled Disclination Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects, such as disclination lines in nematic liquid crystals, are fundamental to many physical systems and applications. In this work, we study the behavior of nematic disclinations in thin parallel-plate geometries with strong patterned planar anchoring. Building on prior models, we solve both the forward problem -- predicting disclination trajectories from given surface patterns -- and an extended inverse problem -- designing surface patterns to produce a tunable family of disclination curves under varying system parameters. We present an explicit calculation for pattern construction, analyze parameter limitations and stability constraints, and highlight experimental and technological applications.</description>

      <title>3D evolution of protein networks and lipid globules in heat-treated egg yolk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon heating, egg yolk transforms from a liquid to a gel due to protein denaturation. This process can serve as a useful model to better understand protein denaturation in general. Using x-ray holographic tomography, we investigated the structural changes in egg yolk during boiling without the need for complex sample fixation or drying. Our results reveal a developing separation between proteins and lipids, with fatty components rapidly aggregating into large globules that subsequently evolve into bubbles.</description>

      <title>Uniform deposition of particles in large scale by drying of binary droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of liquid droplets often results in a ring-like deposition pattern of particles, presenting challenges for applications requiring highly uniform patterns. Despite extensive efforts to suppress the coffee ring effect, achieving a uniform particle distribution remains a great challenge due to the complex and non-equilibrium nature of the evaporation process. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a one-step drying method for binary droplets (water and 2-methoxyethanol) that produces uniform deposition of nano- and micro-particles. By adjusting the initial water volume fraction, we effectively control the interplay between capillary and Marangoni flows, resulting in deposition patterns that vary from coffee ring to uniform and to volcano-like. Through both theoretical and experimental analyses, we determine the conditions necessary for achieving such high uniformity. This approach requires no special substrate treatment, particle modification, or controlled environments, and works for various particles, including silica and polystyrene. Our method provides a robust solution for fabricating uniform patterns that are crucial for many practical applications, ranging from printing to microelectronics to bio-pharmacy.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous shear thickening of a moderately dense inertial suspension of hydrodynamically interacting frictionless soft particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.</description>

      <title>There is Nothing Anomalous about 'Anomalous' Underscreening in Concentrated Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. This disagreement has led to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as 'anomalous underscreening', while moderate screening lengths - predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation - are referred to as 'normal underscreening'. Herein we use discrete Fourier analysis of the radial charge density obtained from molecular dynamics simulations to confirm the presence of many electrostatic screening modes present at any one time. We present a new approach for extracting screening lengths directly from the bulk charge density that reveals the origins of both normal and anomalous underscreening. These results reconcile a decades-old disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content widely utilized in biomedical applications. Injectable depot-forming hydrogels for drug delivery offer sustained release of biomolecular cargo, leveraging controlled macromolecular diffusion within dynamic networks to promote extended immunity and favorable immunological responses. However, mitigating burst release while maintaining sustained-release properties remains a challenge due to network disruption during needle extrusion, leading to excessive short-term cargo release and local toxicity. While controlling both short- and long-term release profiles would mitigate this issue, it remains a persistent challenge. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy for self-regulating, post-injection network evolution enabled by exchange of functional molecules with physiological environment, achieving controlled cargo release over both short and long durations. By tuning network viscoelasticity, we optimized rheological properties to minimize burst release while preserving sustained-release profiles. Using model protein cargo, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated reduced burst release and comparable sustained-release to unmodified control formulations. These findings highlight a novel strategy for precise cargo delivery in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering active motion in quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</description>

      <title>Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surfaces of Schwarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a new class of shapes, called soft cells which fill space as soft tilings without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here, we demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give rise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we further establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz D surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a one-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by carrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the first order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the body-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection underlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical end-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order equivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such classes among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc tiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging standard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin foam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights that both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their generation provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying natural forms. We also present the soft tiling induced by the gyroid structure.</description>
