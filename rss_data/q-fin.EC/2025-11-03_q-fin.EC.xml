      <title>Political Power and Mortality: Heterogeneous Effects of the U.S. Voting Rights Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the health consequences of redistributing political power through the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act, which eliminated barriers to voting for previously disenfranchised nonwhite populations. The intervention led to broad declines in under-five mortality but sharply contrasting effects in other age groups: mortality fell among non-white children, younger adults, and older women, yet rose among whites and older non-white men. These differences cannot be reconciled by changes in population composition or material conditions. Instead, we present evidence suggesting psychosocial stress and retaliatory responses arising from perceived status threat as key mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Hiring Intrinsically Motivated Agents: A Principal's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employers are concerned not only with a prospective worker's ability, but also their propensity to avoid shirking. This paper proposes a new experimental framework to study how Principals trade-off measures of ability and prosocial behavior when ranking Agents for independent jobs. Subjects participate in a simulated, incentivized job market. In an initial session, subjects are Workers and generate a database of signals and job results. Managers in subsequent sessions observe the signals of Worker behavior and ability and job details before a rank-and-value task, ranking and reporting a value for each Worker for two distinct jobs. Results highlight Managers' preference for ability over prosocial behavior on average, especially for Managers in STEM fields. There is evidence of homophily: the relative value of prosocial behavior is higher for highly prosocial Managers, compensating for ability or even surpassing it in value.</description>

      <title>Delegate Pricing Decisions to an Algorithm? Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the delegation of pricing by participants, representing firms, to a collusive, self-learning algorithm in a repeated Bertrand experiment. In the baseline treatment, participants set prices themselves. In the other treatments, participants can either delegate pricing to the algorithm at the beginning of each supergame or receive algorithmic recommendations that they can override. Participants delegate more when they can override the algorithm's decisions. In both algorithmic treatments, prices are lower than in the baseline. Our results indicate that while self-learning pricing algorithms can be collusive, they can foster competition rather than collusion with humans-in-the-loop.</description>

      <title>Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV) segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features (benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery, coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban analytics.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Predation: Equilibrium Analysis in Dynamic Oligopolies with Smooth Market Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predatory pricing -- where a firm strategically lowers prices to undermine competitors -- is a contentious topic in dynamic oligopoly theory, with scholars debating practical relevance and the existence of predatory equilibria. Although finite-horizon dynamic models have long been proposed to capture the strategic intertemporal incentives of oligopolists, the existence and form of equilibrium strategies in settings that allow for firm exit (drop-outs following loss-making periods) have remained an open question. We focus on the seminal dynamic oligopoly model by Selten (1965) that introduces the subgame perfect equilibrium and analyzes smooth market sharing. Equilibrium can be derived analytically in models that do not allow for dropouts, but not in models that can lead to predatory pricing. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in deep reinforcement learning to compute and verify equilibria in finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly games. Our experiments reveal two key findings: first, state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms reliably converge to equilibrium in both perfect- and imperfect-information oligopoly models; second, when firms face asymmetric cost structures, the resulting equilibria exhibit predatory pricing behavior. These results demonstrate that predatory pricing can emerge as a rational equilibrium strategy across a broad variety of model settings. By providing equilibrium analysis of finite-horizon dynamic oligopoly models with drop-outs, our study answers a decade-old question and offers new insights for competition authorities and regulators.</description>

      <title>Varying reference-point salience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The salience of reference points may theoretically influence the loss aversion mechanism in effort provision. However, we still lack a direct test from real competitive settings that uses exogenous variation to measure the effect of salience. We exploit a natural experiment where highly professional and incentivized individuals perform in real competitive settings with exogenous variation of reference-point salience. While a relevant reference point is salient in some cases, it is obscured in others, which, under reasonable assumptions, may affect individuals' expectations. This enables us to examine the effect of reference-point salience on the loss aversion mechanism in effort provision. Our regression discontinuity analyses reveal that individuals with positive expectations outperform those with negative expectations, but only when the reference point is salient.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When online sellers use AI learning algorithms to automatically compete on e-commerce platforms, there is concern that they will learn to coordinate on higher than competitive prices. However, this concern was primarily raised in single-dimension price competition. We investigate whether this prediction holds when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. We analyze competition in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a large-scale dataset from Amazon.com to provide empirical evidence. We show that when consumers have high search costs, learning algorithms can coordinate on prices lower than competitive prices, facilitating a win-win-win for consumers, sellers, and platforms. This occurs because algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices and enlarging demand on the platform. We also show that our results generalize to any learning algorithm that uses exploration of price and advertising bids. Consistent with our predictions, an empirical analysis shows that price levels exhibit a negative interaction between estimated consumer search costs and algorithm usage index. We analyze the platform's strategic response and find that reserve price adjustments will not increase platform profits, but commission adjustments will, while maintaining the beneficial outcomes for both sellers and consumers.</description>

      <title>DETERring more than Deforestation: Environmental Enforcement Reduces Violence in the Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the impact of environmental law enforcement on violence in the Brazilian Amazon. The introduction of the Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER), which enabled the government to monitor deforestation in real time and issue fines for illegal clearing, significantly reduced homicides in the region. To identify causal effects, we exploit exogenous variation in satellite monitoring generated by cloud cover as an instrument for enforcement intensity. Our estimates imply that the expansion of state presence through DETER prevented approximately 1,477 homicides per year, a 15% reduction in homicides. These results show that curbing deforestation produces important social co-benefits, strengthening state presence and reducing violence in regions marked by institutional fragility and resource conflict.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience. We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</description>
