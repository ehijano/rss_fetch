      <title>Charm lifetime measurements at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report precision measurements of lifetimes of charmed mesons and baryons performed by the Belle II experiment. Specifically, we measure $D_s^+$, $D^+$, $D^0$, $\Lambda_c^+$, and $\Omega_c^0$ lifetimes. Our results for $\tau(D_s^+)$, $\tau(D^+)$, $\tau(D^0)$, and $\tau(\Lambda_c^+)$ are the world's most precise; our result for $\tau(\Omega_c^0)$ confirms that the $\Omega_c^0$ lifetime is longer than that of the $\Lambda_c^+$ and the $\Xi_c^0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basic idea of $CP$ violation and its importance for cosmology, Standard Model and possible New Physics are introduced. Recent (2019) discovery of CP violation in charm in the $\Delta A_{CP}$ between $D^0\rightarrow K^-K^+$ and $D^0\rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ decay channels and evidence for direct CP violation in $D^0\rightarrow \pi^-\pi^+$ decays in 2023 is discussed. Motivation and brief outline for search of CP violation in the $D^0\rightarrow V\gamma$, where $V=\phi,\rho^0, \bar{K}^{*0}$ decays is given.</description>

      <title>Measurement of hadronic cross sections via initial state radiation at BABAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BABAR experiment participates to the global endeavor for a precise prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon by evaluating the contribution of hadronic processes to the vacuum polarization. After its last result published in 2009 and 2012, BABAR is preparing a new independent measurement of the $e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-(\gamma)$ cross section via initial state radiation, with full data statistics and improved uncertainties. A first milestone was reached with the recent study of additional radiations in $e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-(\gamma)$ and $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-(\gamma)$, which uncovered shortcomings of the Phokhara Monte Carlo generator in one-photon rates and angular distributions. This has practically no effect on the previous BABAR measurement, but could explain longstanding discrepancies with other experiments.</description>

      <title>Binned angular analysis of $B^{0} \to K^{*0} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ with LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ flavor-changing neutral current decays is a powerful test of the Standard Model (SM). Due to the strong suppression of these modes in the SM, potential New Physics contributions can have a significant impact on the measured physics observables. The angular analysis of $B^{0} \to K^{*0} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ decays gives access to optimized angular observables, which are less dependent on hadronic form factors than for example branching fraction measurements. The angular observables are extracted in bins of the invariant dimuon mass squared, $q^2$, making the analysis model-independent with respect to any assumptions about the shape of the signal distribution in $q^2$. Previous binned measurements of the $B^{0} \to K^{*0} \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ angular observables by LHCb were in tension with the SM at the level of $3.3$ standard deviations ($\sigma$). These proceedings present the ongoing effort to update the binned angular analysis to include the full Run 1 and Run 2 data sample of LHCb.</description>

      <title>Targeting (Pseudo)-Scalar CP Violation with $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leptonic decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$ is both rare and theoretically clean, making it an excellent probe for New Physics searches. Due to its helicity suppression in the Standard Model, this decay is particularly sensitive to new (pseudo)-scalar contributions. We present a new strategy for detecting CP-violating New Physics contributions of this kind, exploiting two observables: $\adg$, which is accessible due to the sizeable decay width difference of the $B_s$ system, and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry $\smumu$. We also utilize information from semileptonic $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. Using the currently available experimental information, we find remarkably constrained regions in the $\adg$--$\smumu$ plane that serve as promising targets for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Solar Models and Astrophysical S-factors Constrained by Helioseismic Results and Updated Neutrino Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, $(Z/X)_{s}$, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for $(Z/X)_{s}$, which is still in debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg's abundance scale exhibit superior sound-speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within $1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of $1\sigma$. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical $S$-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that $S_{11}$ may be underestimated by $2\%$, while $S_{33}$ may be overestimated by about $3\%$ in previous determinations. The $S$-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.</description>

      <title>Overview of high-density QCD studies with the CMS experiment at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heavy ion (HI) physics program has proven to be an essential part of the overall physics program at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Its main purpose has been to provide a detailed characterization of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons created in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. From the start of the LHC HI program with lead-lead collisions, the CMS Collaboration has performed measurements using additional data sets in different center-of-mass energies with xenon-xenon, proton-lead, and proton-proton collisions. A broad collection of observables related to high-density quantum chromodynamics (QCD), precision quantum electrodynamics (QED), and even novel searches of phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM) have been studied. Major advances toward understanding the macroscopic and microscopic QGP properties were achieved at the highest temperature reached in the laboratory and for vanishingly small values of the baryon chemical potential. This article summarizes key QCD, QED, as well as BSM physics, results of the CMS HI program for the LHC Runs 1 (2010-2013) and 2 (2015-2018). It reviews findings on the partonic content of nuclei and properties of the QGP and describes the surprising QGP-like effects in collision systems smaller than lead-lead or xenon-xenon. In addition, it outlines the scientific case of using ultrarelativistic HI collisions in the coming decades to characterize the QGP with unparalleled precision and to probe novel fundamental physics phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing the heavy neutrino hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a strong experimental program searching for massive sterile neutrinos. Here we focus on the heavy regime above the GeV scale, where their existence can be probed in either high-energy colliders or in high-precision facilities. We first review the current experimental status at colliders, showing that the LHC already improves LEP results for mixings to electrons and muons, while mixings to taus remain challenging at a hadron collider. We also discuss the importance of exploring both lepton number violating and conserving signals, as well as different flavor channels. Finally, we present the latest global analysis of electroweak precision and flavor observables, showing that the intensity frontier provides the strongest constraints for heavy neutrino masses above the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the total and differential cross-sections of $t\bar{t}W$ production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of inclusive and differential production cross-sections of a top-quark-top-antiquark pair in association with a $W$ boson ($t\bar{t}W$) are presented. They are performed by targeting final states with two same-sign or three isolated leptons (electrons or muons) and are based on $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, recorded from 2015 to 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The inclusive $t\bar{t}W$ production cross-section is measured to be $880 \pm 80$ fb, compared to a reference theoretical prediction of $745 \pm 50\,\textrm{(scale)} \pm 13\,\textrm{(2-loop approx.)} \pm 19\,\textrm{(PDF,} \alpha_{\textrm{S}})$ fb. Differential cross-section measurements characterise this process in detail for the first time. Several particle-level observables are compared with a variety of theoretical predictions, which generally agree well with the normalised differential cross-section results. Additionally, the relative charge asymmetry of $t\bar{t}W^{+}$ and $t\bar{t}W^{-}$ is measured inclusively to be ${A_{\mathrm{C}}^{\mathrm{rel}}} = 0.33 \pm 0.05$, in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction of $0.322 \pm 0.003\,\mathrm{(scale)} \pm 0.007\,\mathrm{(PDF)}$, as well as differentially.</description>

      <title>Combination of searches for heavy spin-1 resonances using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combination of searches for new heavy spin-1 resonances decaying into different pairings of $W$, $Z$, or Higgs bosons, as well as directly into leptons or quarks, is presented. The data sample used corresponds to 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected during 2015-2018 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Analyses selecting quark pairs ($qq$, $bb$, $t\bar{t}$, and $tb$) or third-generation leptons ($\tau\nu$ and $\tau\tau$) are included in this kind of combination for the first time. A simplified model predicting a spin-1 heavy vector-boson triplet is used. Cross-section limits are set at the 95% confidence level and are compared with predictions for the benchmark model. These limits are also expressed in terms of constraints on couplings of the heavy vector-boson triplet to quarks, leptons, and the Higgs boson. The complementarity of the various analyses increases the sensitivity to new physics, and the resulting constraints are stronger than those from any individual analysis considered. The data exclude a heavy vector-boson triplet with mass below 5.8 TeV in a weakly coupled scenario, below 4.4 TeV in a strongly coupled scenario, and up to 1.5 TeV in the case of production via vector-boson fusion.</description>

      <title>Search for a light muon-philic $Z'$ with the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclusion of an additional U(1) gauge $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z'$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$ and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z'$ boson acts as a "portal" to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z'$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $ \sim 9 \times 10^{11}$ 100-GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z'$ production yield with an electron beam, the limits sets by NA64-$e$ are competitive with other experimental searches, and partially exclude the $g-2$ preferred model parameter values for $Z'$ masses lighter than 2 MeV. This result proves the complementarity of this search with NA64-${\mu}$, the parallel effort of the NA64 collaboration with a muon beam.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of charged-particle production in pp, p-Pb, Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplicity ($N_{\rm ch}$) distributions and transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of inclusive primary charged particles in the kinematic range of $|\eta| &lt; 0.8$ and 0.15 GeV/$c$ $&lt; p_{T} &lt;$ 10 GeV/$c$ are reported for pp, p-Pb, Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energies per nucleon pair ranging from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV up to $13$ TeV. A sequential two-dimensional unfolding procedure is used to extract the correlation between the transverse momentum of primary charged particles and the charged-particle multiplicity of the corresponding collision. This correlation sharply characterises important features of the final state of a collision and, therefore, can be used as a stringent test of theoretical models. The multiplicity distributions as well as the mean and standard deviation derived from the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra are compared to state-of-the-art model predictions. Providing these fundamental observables of bulk particle production consistently across a wide range of collision energies and system sizes can serve as an important input for tuning Monte Carlo event generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-parton interactions are a fascinating phenomenon that occur in almost every high-energy hadron--hadron collision, yet are remarkably difficult to study quantitatively. In this letter we present a strategy to optimally disentangle multi-parton interactions from the primary scattering in a collision. That strategy enables probes of multi-parton interactions that are significantly beyond the state of the art, including their characteristic momentum scale, the interconnection between primary and secondary scatters, and the pattern of three and potentially even more simultaneous hard scatterings. This opens a path to powerful new constraints on multi-parton interactions for LHC phenomenology and to the investigation of their rich field-theoretical structure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of nuclear effects in neutrino-argon interactions using generalized kinematic imbalance variables with the MicroBooNE detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of new generalized kinematic imbalance variables that can be measured in neutrino scattering. These variables extend previous measurements of kinematic imbalance on the transverse plane, and are more sensitive to modeling of nuclear effects. We demonstrate the enhanced power of these variables using simulation, and then use the MicroBooNE detector to measure them for the first time. We report flux-integrated single- and double-differential measurements of charged-current muon neutrino scattering on argon using a topolgy with one muon and one proton in the final state as a function of these novel kinematic imbalance variables. These measurements allow us to demonstrate that the treatment of charged current quasielastic interactions in GENIE version 2 is inadequate to describe data. Further, they reveal tensions with more modern generator predictions particularly in regions of phase space where final state interactions are important.</description>

      <title>Study the structure of X(3872) from its lineshape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fit the invariant mass distribution of ${X(3872)}\rightarrow{J}/{\psi}\pi^+\pi^-$ from LHCb and ${X(3872)}\rightarrow{D}^{0}\overline{D}^{0*}$ from Belle using the propagator for S-wave threshold states in effective field theory. In this way, we can directly determine the $Z$ which is the probability of finding the compact component in ${X(3872)}$.</description>

      <title>Lepton pair production in muon-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims at providing a novel determination of the leading hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment through the study of elastic muon-electron scattering. Since the initial-state electrons are bound in a low-$Z$ atomic target, the interaction between the incoming muons and the nuclei is expected to be the main source of experimental background. In this article, we study the production of a real lepton pair from the muon-nucleus scattering, discussing its numerical impact in the MUonE kinematic configuration. The process is described as a scattering of a muon in an external Coulomb field with the addition of a form factor to describe the nuclear charge distribution. The calculation is implemented in the fully differential Monte Carlo event generator MESMER, without introducing any approximation on the angular variables.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Unfolding with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent innovations from machine learning allow for data unfolding, without binning and including correlations across many dimensions. We describe a set of known, upgraded, and new methods for ML-based unfolding. The performance of these approaches are evaluated on the same two datasets. We find that all techniques are capable of accurately reproducing the particle-level spectra across complex observables. Given that these approaches are conceptually diverse, they offer an exciting toolkit for a new class of measurements that can probe the Standard Model with an unprecedented level of detail and may enable sensitivity to new phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tau polarization in neutrino-nucleus interactions at the LHC energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering that the study of neutrino-nucleus interactions with incident neutrino energy ranges in the GeV-TeV range is feasible at the Large Hadron Collider, we investigate in this paper the degree of polarization ${\cal{P}}$ of the (anti) tau lepton produced in (anti) tau neutrino - tungsten interactions. We estimate the differential cross-sections and the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau lepton polarization as a function of the tau lepton energy and distinct values of the scattering angle, assuming different values for the energy of the incoming (anti) tau neutrino. Different models for the treatment of the nuclear effects in the parton distribution functions are assumed as input in the calculations. Our results indicate that $ {\cal{P}} &lt; 1$ for the neutrino energies reached at the LHC and are almost insensitive to the nuclear effects.</description>
