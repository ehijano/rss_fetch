      <title>Hartman-Grobman Theorem for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Hartman-Grobman theorem to systems perturbed with white noises. Let's recall that, in deterministic systems, the Hartman-Grobman theorem establishes the "topological equivalence" of the local phase portrait between a system and its linearization around hyperbolic fixed points; hence, simplifying the study of the stability at those points.
  However, it should be pointed out that, the conditions for a "useful" linear approximation of a non-linear system do not solely involved hyperbolic points; indeed, Nils Berglund and Barbara Gentz for example conspicuously used it in their book [3]; particularly during their study of white noise perturbed slow-fast dynamical systems. Yet, since our focus is on behavior of critical points of a system, we need to make sure that the linear approximation of our perturbed system is equivalent in some sense to the perturbed system of the linear approximation of the corresponding deterministic system.
  The paper is organized as follow: we first establish the theorem when the "diffusion" matrix is invertible. We continue by examining the case of non-invertible matrices, and non square matrices. We then apply the results to the study of Multi-dimensional slow-fast systems done by Berglund and Gentz [3] by weakening regularity conditions.</description>

      <title>Quenched correlation decay for random splittings of some prototypical 3D flows including the ABC flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the long-time dynamical challenges of some prototypical 3D flows including the ABC flow on $\mathbb{T}^3$, we apply a random splitting method to establish two fundamental indicators of chaotic dynamics. First, under general assumptions, we establish that these random splittings exhibit Lagrangian chaos, characterized by a positive top Lyapunov exponent. Furthermore, we demonstrate the almost-sure quenched correlation decay of these random splittings, which is a stronger property than the almost-sure positivity of Lyapunov exponents alone. This framework is then applied to construct ideal dynamo in kinematic dynamo theory and to establish exponential mixing of passive scalars.</description>

      <title>Hopf bifurcation in a memory-based diffusion competition model with spatial heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion system with self-memory effects and spatial heterogeneity under Dirichlet boundary conditions. We focus on how memory strength influences the coexistence and stability of competing species. By analyzing the characteristic equation, we establish the existence and stability of a spatially nonhomogeneous positive steady state and demonstrate the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation as memory delay increases. Our results reveal that both weak and some opposing memory effects of two competing species promote stable coexistence, while strong memory may destabilize the system and lead to periodic oscillations. Spatial heterogeneity further enriches the dynamical behaviors. Numerical simulations are presented to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Abstract Continuity Theorem for the Lyapunov Exponents of linear cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents for general linear cocycles when the base measures vary in Wasserstein distance, under the assumption of uniform large deviations type (LDT) estimates. This is a measure version of the abstract continuity theorem (ACT) established by Duarte-Klein [Duarte, P. and Klein, S. (2016). Lyapunov exponents of linear cocycles: Continuity via large deviations. Atlantis Studies in Dynamical Systems, 3]. The main obstacle here lies in the fact that the magnitude of the exceptional sets in LDT estimates is constantly changing when the base measures deviate. We overcome this via a combination of a Urysohn-type lemma and properties of Wasserstein distance in every iteration step. Our measure version of ACT, combined with the original work of Duarte-Klein, provides a complete scheme for proving joint H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents with respect to both measure and fiber which resolves all parameter dependence. This continuity theorem is general and applicable to a wide range of mathematical models, including product of random matrices and cocycles essentially generated by shifts. In particular, it applies to associated Schr\"odinger operators which are central objects in the study of mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of Darwinian evolution in two mathematical models. The first one is a variation on the Malthusian population growth model with Verhulst's environmental capacity. The second model is grounded in the theory of Markov chains and their stationary distributions. We prove preliminary results regarding both models and pose conjectures, which are supported by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>On dissociated infinite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is threefold. First, we describe the notion of dissociation for closed subgroups of the group of permutations on a countably infinite set and explain its numerous consequences on unitary representations (classification of unitary representations, Property (T), Howe-Moore property, etc.) and on ergodic actions (non-existence of type III non-singular actions, Stabilizer rigidity, etc.). Some of the results presented here are new, others were proved in different contexts. Second, we introduce a new method to prove dissociation. It is based on a reinforcement of the classical notion of strong amalgamation, where we allow to amalgamate over countable sets. Third, we apply this technique of amalgamation to provide new examples of dissociated closed permutation groups, including isometry groups of some metrically homogeneous graphs, automorphism groups of diversities, and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent article of J.P. Bell, K. Huang, W. Peng and T.J. Tucker establishes an analog of the Tits alternative for semigroups of endomorphisms of the projective line. The proof involves a ping-pong argument on arithmetic height functions. Extending this method, we obtain a uniform version of the same alternative. In particular, we show that semigroups of $\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{P}^{1})$ of exponential growth are of uniform exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Primality and the ideal intersection property for reduced crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the ideal structure of reduced crossed products over discrete groups. First, we completely characterize primality for reduced crossed products. Second, we characterize the ideal intersection property for reduced crossed products over FC-hypercentral groups. Both of these characterizations are intrinsic, in terms of conditions on the underlying dynamics. A key intermediate result is a complete characterization of the regular ideal intersection property for reduced crossed products. For C*-dynamical systems over groups with restrictive subgroup structure, these characterizations simplify even further, which we demonstrate with a number of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model order reduction for T-Product-Based dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model order reduction plays a crucial role in simplifying complex systems while preserving their essential dynamic characteristics, making it an invaluable tool in a wide range of applications, including robotic systems, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. However, traditional model order reduction techniques like balanced truncation are not designed to handle tensor data directly and instead require unfolding the data, which may lead to the loss of important higher-order structural information. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for data-driven model order reduction of T-product-based dynamical systems (TPDSs), which are often used to capture the evolution of third-order tensor data such as images and videos through the T-product. Specifically, we develop advanced T-product-based techniques, including T-balanced truncation, T-balanced proper orthogonal decomposition, and the T-eigensystem realization algorithm for input-output TPDSs by leveraging the unique properties of T-singular value decomposition. We demonstrate that these techniques offer significant memory and computational savings while achieving reduction errors that are comparable to those of conventional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further validated through synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Planar chemical reaction systems with algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hilbert number $H(n)$ is defined as the maximum number of limit cycles of a planar autonomous system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with right-hand sides containing polynomials of degree at most $n \in {\mathbb N}$. The dynamics of chemical reaction systems with two chemical species can be (under mass-action kinetics) described by such planar autonomous ODEs, where $n$ is equal to the maximum order of the chemical reactions in the system. Analogues of the Hilbert number $H(n)$ for three different classes of chemical reaction systems are investigated: (i) chemical systems with reactions up to the $n$-th order; (ii) systems with up to $n$-molecular chemical reactions; and (iii) weakly reversible chemical reaction networks. In each case (i), (ii) and (iii), the question on the number of limit cycles is considered. Lower bounds on the modified Hilbert numbers are provided for both algebraic and non-algebraic limit cycles. Furthermore, given a general algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ of degree $n_h \in {\mathbb N}$ and containing one or more ovals in the positive quadrant, a chemical system is constructed which has the oval(s) as its stable algebraic limit cycle(s). The ODEs describing the dynamics of the constructed chemical system contain polynomials of degree at most $n=2\,n_h+1.$ Considering $n_h \ge 4,$ the algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ can contain multiple closed components with the maximum number of ovals given by Harnack's curve theorem as $1+(n_h-1)(n_h-2)/2$, which is equal to 4 for $n_h=4.$ Algebraic curve $h(x,y)=0$ with $n_h=4$ and the maximum number of four ovals is used to construct a chemical system which has four stable algebraic limit cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations. Our goal has been to define a meaningful concept of graph of any dynamical system. As a result, we base our definition of ``chain graph'' on ``epsilon-chains'', defining both nodes and edges of the graph in terms of chains. In particular, nodes are often maximal limit sets and there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Our initial goal was to prove that every ``chain graph'' of a dynamical system is, in some sense, connected, and we prove connectedness under mild hypotheses.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

Abstract: We investigate expansiveness, topological stability, and shadowing for continuous actions of semigroups on compact Hausdorff spaces. We characterize semigroups for which all full shifts are expansive. We show that every expansive continuous monoid action on a compact Hausdorff space which has the shadowing property is topologically stable, and that a subshift with finite alphabet over a monoid has the shadowing property if and only if it is of finite type.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a family of Hofer-like metrics ($\dAnV{V}$) on the space of Anosov vector fields $\An(M)$, providing dynamically relevant distances based on the cost of deformation paths using $\Ck{k}$ or Sobolev $\SobolevHk{k}$ norms. We establish fundamental properties, including completeness for $V= C^r (r \ge 1)$ or $H^k (k &gt; \dim(M)/2+1)$, and naturality under diffeomorphisms. We show the utility of these metrics by proving quantitative stability results: proximity in $\dAnV{V}$ implies controlled variation of essential dynamical invariants, including topological entropy, Lyapunov exponents, SRB measures, thermodynamic pressure, spectral gaps (mixing rates), and zeta functions. Sufficient regularity ensures local Lipschitz continuity and Fr\'echet differentiability, connecting the metric structure to linear response formulas, particularly for pressure, exponents, and the spectral gap. While Sobolev metrics yield locally flat geometry with straight line geodesics, the framework is broadly applicable. We explore implications for the moduli space of Anosov flows, including stability of invariants and the framework for local slice theorems. Furthermore, we introduce \emph{Topological Anosov Flows}, defined via simultaneous uniform flow convergence and $\dAn$ metric convergence of the generating fields. This new class aims to capture essential hyperbolic features in non-smooth settings. Overall, the proposed metrics offer several geometric perspectives for analyzing the stability, classification, and possible extensions of Anosov dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model reduction of dynamical systems with root mean squared error</title>

Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity, hypercyclicity and randomness in self-similar groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of cyclicity and hypercyclicity in self-similar groups as an analogue of cyclic and hypercyclic vectors for an operator on a Banach space. We derive a sufficient condition for cyclicity of non-finitary automorphisms in contracting discrete automata groups. In the profinite setting we prove that fractal profinite groups may be regarded as measure-preserving dynamical systems and derive a sufficient condition for the ergodicity and the mixing properties of these dynamical systems. Furthermore, we show that a Haar-random element in a super strongly fractal profinite group is hypercyclic almost surely as an application of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for free semigroup actions.</description>

      <title>Effective Velocities in the Toda Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Toda lattice $(\boldsymbol{p}(t); \boldsymbol{q}(t))$ at thermal equilibrium, meaning that its variables $(p_i)$ and $(e^{q_i-q_{i+1}})$ are independent Gaussian and Gamma random variables, respectively. This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix.</description>
