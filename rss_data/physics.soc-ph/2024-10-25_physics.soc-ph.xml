      <title>Massive Genealogies Distinguish Frontier from Steady-State Internal Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of human migration have focused on modern issues of international economics, politics, urbanization, or commuting. Here we make use of very large anonymized genealogies which offer quantitative metrics and models before census data became available. In European and North American data from 1400 to 1950 we find two distinct patterns of lifetime migration. The steady-state pattern shows a universal power-law distribution of migration distance; by its early appearance it cannot be dependent on post-industrial technology. The frontier pattern, in contrast, is not scale-free with its much longer average distances. All migration distances are well fit by a three parameter model; the temporal and geographic patterns of the fitted parameters give new insight to American internal expansion 1620-1950. Frontier migration is also highly directional and asymmetric; gravity models do not apply. The American frontier pattern arose from the colonial-era steady-state within a generation, plateaued for three generations, then returned to a more mobile steady-state, a sequence paralleled by the Steppe migrations that brought the Bronze Age to Neolithic Europe. The transient frontier pattern is enabled by large-scale technological or numeric imbalance and geographic opportunity; when these forces abate, a new steady-state begins.</description>

      <title>Potemkin village of Russian science: The case of JINR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document reviews international cooperation of the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR). It shows that of the original 11 founding members of the JINR, only one -- Mongolia -- is still fully active within the organization. Out of 16 existing members four have their participation suspended. The review of the Topical Plan for JINR Research and International Cooperation 2024 shows that the number of 990 institutes collaborating with JINR is overestimated by at least 10% and probably closer to 25%. Countries with the highest number of participating institutes listed for 2024 are Russia, USA and Italy with 203, 77 and 49 institutes, respectively. JINR collaboration with impostor institutes on the occupied territories of Ukraine is presented as well as JINR publications which associate the occupied Ukrainian territories to Russia. JINR cooperation with organizations in Russia, which are under sanctions for their support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contribution to the war effort, is also discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this doctoral thesis, we investigate the complex interplay between temporal dynamics associated with aging and memory and their effects on social and economic systems. To do so, we combine theoretical modeling, to explore the aging implications in threshold (peer pressure) models, and empirical analysis, to address the impact of temporal and spatial patterns in real complex systems, taking housing market as a case study.</description>

      <title>Exploring Network Structure with the Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection, as well as the identification of other structures like core periphery and disassortative patterns, is an important topic in network analysis. While most methods seek to find the best partition of the network according to some criteria, there is a body of results that suggest that a single network can have many good but distinct partitions. In this paper we introduce the density of states as a tool for studying the space of all possible network partitions. We demonstrate how to use the well known Wang-Landau method to compute a network's density of states. We show that, even using modularity to measure quality, the density of states can still rule out spurious structure in random networks and overcome resolution limits. We demonstrate how these methods can be used to find `building blocks', groups of nodes which are consistently found together in detected communities. This suggests an approach to partitioning based on exploration of the network's structure landscape rather than optimisation.</description>

      <title>Synergistic signatures of group mechanisms in higher-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between causal mechanisms and emerging collective behaviors is a central aspect of understanding, controlling, and predicting complex networked systems. In our work, we investigate the relationship between higher-order mechanisms and higher-order behavioral observables in two representative models with group interactions: a simplicial Ising model and a social contagion model. In both systems, we find that group (higher-order) interactions show emergent synergistic (higher-order) behavior. The emergent synergy appears only at the group level and depends in a complex, non-linear way on the trade-off between the strengths of the low- and higher-order mechanisms and is invisible to low-order behavioral observables. Our work sets the basis for systematically investigating the relation between causal mechanisms and behavioral patterns in complex networked systems with group interactions, offering a robust methodological framework to tackle this challenging task.</description>

      <title>The microscopic origin of abrupt transitions in interdependent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental features of statistical physics. While the well-studied continuous phase transitions are known to be controlled by external \textit{macroscopic} changes in the order parameter, the origin of abrupt transitions is not yet clear. Here we show that abrupt phase transitions may occur due to a unique internal \textit{microscopic} cascading mechanism, resulting from dependency interactions. We experimentally unveil the underlying mechanism of the abrupt transition in interdependent superconducting networks to be governed by a unique metastable state of a long-living resistance cascading plateau. This plateau is characterized by spontaneous \textit{microscopic} changes that last for \textit{thousands} of seconds, followed by a \textit{macroscopic} phase shift of the system. Similar microscopic mechanisms are expected to be found in a variety of systems showing abrupt transitions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Parallel Boarding Methods in a Multi-Aisle Flying Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the speed of different boarding methods in a proposed Flying Wing aircraft design with four aisles using an agent-based model. We study the effect of various passenger movement variables on the boarding process. We evaluate the impact of these factors on the boarding time when the boarding process runs sequentially and in parallel with the aisles of the Flying Wing layout. Then, we analyze the impact of an increase in the number of aisles on the relative speed of all boarding methods and conclude that methods utilizing boarding of the separate aisles simultaneously (parallel boarding) converge to the fastest boarding time given by the Steffen method. With parallel boarding of the aisles the relative advantage of the Steffen method compared to Windows-Middle-Aisle (WMA) or Back-to-front boarding decreases, from being 1.6-2.1 times as fast to being approximately equal for our fiducial Flying Wing seating arrangement. Standard methods such as Back-to-front or WMA are about twice as fast to board a four-aisle Flying Wing plane, compared to a single-aisle aircraft with the same number of passengers. We also investigate the difference between the optimal approach to parallel boarding, where consecutive passengers always enter separate aisles, and a less optimal but more practical approach. The practical approach is only up to 1.06 times slower than the optimal, meaning that the advantages of parallel boarding can be utilized without resorting to impractical boarding methods. Hence, the introduction of multiple aisles into aircraft seating design offers the prospect of significantly decreasing the boarding time for passengers, without the introduction of inconvenient boarding methods.</description>

      <title>Forecasting trends in food security with real time data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early warning systems are an essential tool for effective humanitarian action. Advance warnings on impending disasters facilitate timely and targeted response which help save lives and livelihoods. In this work we present a quantitative methodology to forecast levels of food consumption for 60 consecutive days, at the sub-national level, in four countries: Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen. The methodology is built on publicly available data from the World Food Programme's global hunger monitoring system which collects, processes, and displays daily updates on key food security metrics, conflict, weather events, and other drivers of food insecurity. In this study we assessed the performance of various models including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Reservoir Computing (RC), by comparing their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. Our findings highlight Reservoir Computing as a particularly well-suited model in the field of food security given both its notable resistance to over-fitting on limited data samples and its efficient training capabilities. The methodology we introduce establishes the groundwork for a global, data-driven early warning system designed to anticipate and detect food insecurity.</description>

      <title>The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods that extend Baldassari and Gelman's theory of polarisation. They show that it is useful to define polarisation as increasing correlation between positions in an ideological field, which reduces political pluralism. We also draw from post-structuralist work which argues that deliberate development of these correlations is a feature of polarised regimes such as apartheid.
  To measure polarisation in social networks, we use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of a social network provides an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. Each uncorrelated dimension in a social network represents a part of that society which allows two people from different groups to form a social connection, such as living in a racially integrated neighbourhood. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We apply this method to the communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues from 2017 to 2023. We find that the discussion is more polarised after 2020 than before, as shown by a decrease in the dimensionality of the communication network. Second, we apply this method to discussions of the COP climate change conferences, showing that our methods agree with other researchers' detections of polarisation in this space. Finally, we use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>
