      <title>Selective Information Borrowing for Region-Specific Treatment Effect Inference under Covariate Mismatch in Multi-Regional Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-regional clinical trials (MRCTs) are central to global drug development, enabling evaluation of treatment effects across diverse populations. A key challenge is valid and efficient inference for a region-specific estimand when the target region is small and differs from auxiliary regions in baseline covariates or unmeasured factors. We adopt an estimand-based framework and focus on the region-specific average treatment effect (RSATE) in a prespecified target region, which is directly relevant to local regulatory decision-making. Cross-region differences can induce covariate shift, covariate mismatch, and outcome drift, potentially biasing information borrowing and invalidating RSATE inference. To address these issues, we develop a unified causal inference framework with selective information borrowing. First, we introduce an inverse-variance weighting estimator that combines a "small-sample, rich-covariate" target-only estimator with a "large-sample, limited-covariate" full-borrowing doubly robust estimator, maximizing efficiency under no outcome drift. Second, to accommodate outcome drift, we apply conformal prediction to assess patient-level comparability and adaptively select auxiliary-region patients for borrowing. Third, to ensure rigorous finite-sample inference, we employ a conditional randomization test with exact, model-free, selection-aware type I error control. Simulation studies show the proposed estimator improves efficiency, yielding 10-50% reductions in mean squared error and higher power relative to no-borrowing and full-borrowing approaches, while maintaining valid inference across diverse scenarios. An application to the POWER trial further demonstrates improved precision for RSATE estimation.</description>

      <title>Effect-Wise Inference for Smoothing Spline ANOVA on Tensor-Product Sobolev Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional ANOVA provides a nonparametric modeling framework for multivariate covariates, enabling flexible estimation and interpretation of effect functions such as main effects and interaction effects. However, effect-wise inference in such models remains challenging. Existing methods focus primarily on inference for entire functions rather than individual effects. Methods addressing effect-wise inference face substantial limitations: the inability to accommodate interactions, a lack of rigorous theoretical foundations, or restriction to pointwise inference. To address these limitations, we develop a unified framework for effect-wise inference in smoothing spline ANOVA on a subspace of tensor product Sobolev space. For each effect function, we establish rates of convergence, pointwise confidence intervals, and a Wald-type test for whether the effect is zero, with power achieving the minimax distinguishable rate up to a logarithmic factor. Main effects achieve the optimal univariate rates, and interactions achieve optimal rates up to logarithmic factors. The theoretical foundation relies on an orthogonality decomposition of effect subspaces, which enables the extension of the functional Bahadur representation framework to effect-wise inference in smoothing spline ANOVA with interactions. Simulation studies and real-data application to the Colorado temperature dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Markov Random Fields: Structural Properties, Phase Transition, and Response Function Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a focused review of Markov random fields (MRFs)--commonly used probabilistic representations of spatial dependence in discrete spatial domains--for categorical data, with an emphasis on models for binary-valued observations or latent variables. We examine core structural properties of these models, including clique factorization, conditional independence, and the role of neighborhood structures. We also discuss the phenomenon of phase transition and its implications for statistical model specification and inference. A central contribution of this review is the use of response functions, a unifying tool we introduce for prior analysis that provides insight into how different formulations of MRFs influence implied marginal and joint distributions. We illustrate these concepts through a case study of direct-data MRF models with covariates, highlighting how different formulations encode dependence. While our focus is on binary fields, the principles outlined here extend naturally to more complex categorical MRFs and we draw connections to these higher-dimensional modeling scenarios. This review provides both theoretical grounding and practical tools for interpreting and extending MRF-based models.</description>

      <title>Disentangling spatial interference and spatial confounding biases in causal inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial interference and spatial confounding are two major issues inhibiting precise causal estimates when dealing with observational spatial data. Moreover, the definition and interpretation of spatial confounding remain arguable in the literature. In this paper, our goal is to provide clarity in a novel way on misconception and issues around spatial confounding from Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) perspective and to disentangle both direct, indirect spatial confounding and spatial interference based on bias induced on causal estimates. Also, existing analyses of spatial confounding bias typically rely on Normality assumptions for treatments and confounders, assumptions that are often violated in practice. Relaxing these assumptions, we derive analytical expressions for spatial confounding bias under more general distributional settings using Poisson as example . We showed that the choice of spatial weights, the distribution of the treatment, and the magnitude of interference critically determine the extent of bias due to spatial interference. We further demonstrate that direct and indirect spatial confounding can be disentangled, with both the weight matrix and the nature of exposure playing central roles in determining the magnitude of indirect bias. Theoretical results are supported by simulation studies and an application to real-world spatial data. In future, parametric frameworks for concomitantly adjusting for spatial interference, direct and indirect spatial confounding for both direct and mediated effects estimation will be developed.</description>

      <title>A Model-Robust G-Computation Method for Analyzing Hybrid Control Studies Without Assuming Exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in a hybrid control design for treatment evaluation, where a randomized controlled trial is augmented with external control data from a previous trial or a real world data source. The hybrid control design has the potential to improve efficiency but also carries the risk of introducing bias. The potential bias in a hybrid control study can be mitigated by adjusting for baseline covariates that are related to the control outcome. Existing methods that serve this purpose commonly assume that the internal and external control outcomes are exchangeable upon conditioning on a set of measured covariates. Possible violations of the exchangeability assumption can be addressed using a g-computation method with variable selection under a correctly specified outcome regression model. In this article, we note that a particular version of this g-computation method is protected against misspecification of the outcome regression model. This observation leads to a model-robust g-computation method that is remarkably simple and easy to implement, consistent and asymptotically normal under minimal assumptions, and able to improve efficiency by exploiting similarities between the internal and external control groups. The method is evaluated in a simulation study and illustrated using real data from HIV treatment trials.</description>

      <title>Functional regression with multivariate responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the functional regression model with multivariate response and functional predictors. Compared to fitting each individual response variable separately, taking advantage of the correlation between the response variables can improve the estimation and prediction accuracy. Using information in both functional predictors and multivariate response, we identify the optimal decomposition of the coefficient functions for prediction in population level. Then we propose methods to estimate this decomposition and fit the regression model for the situations of a small and a large number $p$ of functional predictors separately. For a large $p$, we propose a simultaneous smooth-sparse penalty which can both make curve selection and improve estimation and prediction accuracy. We provide the asymptotic results when both the sample size and the number of functional predictors go to infinity. Our method can be applied to models with thousands of functional predictors and has been implemented in the R package FRegSigCom.</description>

      <title>Shiha Distribution: Statistical Properties and Applications to Reliability Engineering and Environmental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new two-parameter distribution, referred to as the Shiha distribution, which provides a flexible model for skewed lifetime data with either heavy or light tails. The proposed distribution is applicable to various fields, including reliability engineering, environmental studies, and related areas. We derive its main statistical properties, including the moment generating function, moments, hazard rate function, quantile function, and entropy. The stress--strength reliability parameter is also derived in closed form. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate its performance. Applications to several real data sets demonstrate that the Shiha distribution consistently provides a superior fit compared with established competing models, confirming its practical effectiveness for lifetime data analysis.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum-of-Trees Model for Clustered Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustered data, which arise when observations are nested within groups, are incredibly common in clinical, education, and social science research. Traditionally, a linear mixed model, which includes random effects to account for within-group correlation, would be used to model the observed data and make new predictions on unseen data. Some work has been done to extend the mixed model approach beyond linear regression into more complex and non-parametric models, such as decision trees and random forests. However, existing methods are limited to using the global fixed effects for prediction on data from out-of-sample groups, effectively assuming that all clusters share a common outcome model. We propose a lightweight sum-of-trees model in which we learn a decision tree for each sample group. We combine the predictions from these trees using weights so that out-of-sample group predictions are more closely aligned with the most similar groups in the training data. This strategy also allows for inference on the similarity across groups in the outcome prediction model, as the unique tree structures and variable importances for each group can be directly compared. We show our model outperforms traditional decision trees and random forests in a variety of simulation settings. Finally, we showcase our method on real-world data from the sarcoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas, where patient samples are grouped by sarcoma subtype.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Shrinkage of Functional Effects, with Application to Analysis of Dynamic eQTLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce functional adaptive shrinkage (FASH), an empirical Bayes method for joint analysis of observation units in which each unit estimates an effect function at several values of a continuous condition variable. The ideas in this paper are motivated by dynamic expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, which aim to characterize how genetic effects on gene expression vary with time or another continuous condition. FASH integrates a broad family of Gaussian processes defined through linear differential operators into an empirical Bayes shrinkage framework, enabling adaptive smoothing and borrowing of information across units. This provides improved estimation of effect functions and principled hypothesis testing, allowing straightforward computation of significance measures such as local false discovery and false sign rates. To encourage conservative inferences, we propose a simple prior- adjustment method that has theoretical guarantees and can be more broadly used with other empirical Bayes methods. We illustrate the benefits of FASH by reanalyzing dynamic eQTL data on cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells. FASH identified novel dynamic eQTLs, revealed diverse temporal effect patterns, and provided improved power compared with the original analysis. More broadly, FASH offers a flexible statistical framework for joint analysis of functional data, with applications extending beyond genomics. To facilitate use of FASH in dynamic eQTL studies and other settings, we provide an accompanying R package at https: //github.com/stephenslab/fashr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance sampling is a Monte Carlo method which designs estimators of expectations under a target distribution using weighted samples from a proposal distribution. When the target distribution is complex, such as multimodal distributions in highdimensional spaces, the efficiency of importance sampling critically depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive scheme for the construction of efficient proposal distributions. Our algorithm promotes efficient exploration of the target distribution by combining global sampling mechanisms with a delayed weighting procedure. The proposed weighting mechanism plays a key role by enabling rapid resampling in regions where the proposal distribution is poorly adapted to the target. Our sampling algorithm is shown to be geometrically convergent under mild assumptions and is illustrated through various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Blinded sample size re-estimation accounting for uncertainty in mid-trial estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For randomized controlled trials to be conclusive, it is important to set the target sample size accurately at the design stage. Comparing two normal populations, the sample size calculation requires specification of the variance other than the treatment effect and misspecification can lead to underpowered studies. Blinded sample size re-estimation is an approach to minimize the risk of inconclusive studies. Existing methods proposed to use the total (one-sample) variance that is estimable from blinded data without knowledge of the treatment allocation. We demonstrate that, since the expectation of this estimator is greater than or equal to the true variance, the one-sample variance approach can be regarded as providing an upper bound of the variance in blind reviews. This worst-case evaluation can likely reduce a risk of underpowered studies. However, blinded reviews of small sample size may still lead to underpowered studies. We propose a refined method accounting for estimation error in blind reviews using an upper confidence limit of the variance. A similar idea had been proposed in the setting of external pilot studies. Furthermore, we developed a method to select an appropriate confidence level so that the re-estimated sample size attains the target power. Numerical studies showed that our method works well and outperforms existing methods. The proposed procedure is motivated and illustrated by recent randomized clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Kriging for large datasets via penalized neighbor selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kriging is a fundamental tool for spatial prediction, but its computational complexity of $O(N^3)$ becomes prohibitive for large datasets. While local kriging using $K$-nearest neighbors addresses this issue, the selection of $K$ typically relies on ad-hoc criteria that fail to account for spatial correlation structure. We propose a penalized kriging framework that incorporates LASSO-type penalties directly into the kriging equations to achieve automatic, data-driven neighbor selection. We further extend this to adaptive LASSO, using data-driven penalty weights that account for the spatial correlation structure. Our method determines which observations contribute non-zero weights through $\ell_1$ regularization, with the penalty parameter selected via a novel criterion based on effective sample size that balances prediction accuracy against information redundancy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that penalized kriging automatically adapts neighborhood structure to the underlying spatial correlation, selecting fewer neighbors for smoother processes and more for highly variable fields, while maintaining prediction accuracy comparable to global kriging at substantially reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference via Regression Projection and Batched Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a lightweight simulation-based inference method that infers simulator parameters using only a regression-based projection of the observed data. After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian variable and hazard structure selection in the General Hazard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proportional hazards (PH) and accelerated failure time (AFT) models are the most widely used hazard structures for analysing time-to-event data. When the goal is to identify variables associated with event times, variable selection is typically performed within a single hazard structure, imposing strong assumptions on how covariates affect the hazard function. To allow simultaneous selection of relevant variables and the hazard structure itself, we develop a Bayesian variable selection approach within the general hazard (GH) model, which includes the PH, AFT, and other structures as special cases. We propose two types of g-priors for the regression coefficients that enable tractable computation and show that both lead to consistent model selection. We also introduce a hierarchical prior on the model space that accounts for multiplicity and penalises model complexity. To efficiently explore the GH model space, we extend the Add-Delete-Swap algorithm to jointly sample variable inclusion indicators and hazard structures. Simulation studies show accurate recovery of both the true hazard structure and active variables across different sample sizes and censoring levels. Two real-data applications are presented to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology and to compare it with existing variable selection methods.</description>

      <title>Downscaling land surface temperature data using edge detection and block-diagonal Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution estimation of land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in estimating evapotranspiration, a measure of plant water use and a central quantity in agricultural applications. In this work, we develop a novel statistical method for downscaling LST data obtained from NASA's ECOSTRESS mission, using high-resolution data from the Landsat 8 mission as a proxy for modeling agricultural field structure. Using the Landsat data, we identify the boundaries of agricultural fields through edge detection techniques, allowing us to capture the inherent block structure present in the spatial domain. We propose a block-diagonal Gaussian process (BDGP) model that captures the spatial structure of the agricultural fields, leverages independence of LST across fields for computational tractability, and accounts for the change of support present in ECOSTRESS observations. We use the resulting BDGP model to perform Gaussian process regression and obtain high-resolution estimates of LST from ECOSTRESS data, along with uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method in producing reliable high-resolution LST estimates, with potential applications in agriculture, urban planning, and climate studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting spatial patterns is fundamental to scientific discovery, yet current methods lack statistical consensus and face computational barriers when applied to large-scale spatial omics datasets. We unify major approaches through a single quadratic form and derive general consistency conditions. We reveal that several widely used methods, including Moran's I, are inconsistent, and propose scalable corrections. The resulting test enables robust pattern detection across millions of spatial locations and single-cell lineage-tracing datasets.</description>

      <title>SC3D: Dynamic and Differentiable Causal Discovery for Temporal and Instantaneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering causal structures from multivariate time series is a key problem because interactions span across multiple lags and possibly involve instantaneous dependencies. Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.</description>

      <title>Unified Inference Framework for Single and Multi-Player Performative Prediction: Method and Asymptotic Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performative prediction characterizes environments where predictive models alter the very data distributions they aim to forecast, triggering complex feedback loops. While prior research treats single-agent and multi-agent performativity as distinct phenomena, this paper introduces a unified statistical inference framework that bridges these contexts, treating the former as a special case of the latter. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we put forward the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) procedure for estimating the performative stability, and establish a rigorous inferential theory for admitting its asymptotic normality and confirming its asymptotic efficiency. Second, for the performative optimality, we introduce a novel two-step plug-in estimator that integrates the idea of Recalibrated Prediction Powered Inference (RePPI) with Importance Sampling, and further provide formal derivations for the Central Limit Theorems of both the underlying distributional parameters and the plug-in results. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and maintains robustness under mild distributional misspecification. This work provides a principled toolkit for reliable estimation and decision-making in dynamic, performative environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs When They Do Not Know the Answer: Statistical Evaluation of Mathematical Reasoning via Comparative Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating mathematical reasoning in LLMs is constrained by limited benchmark sizes and inherent model stochasticity, yielding high-variance accuracy estimates and unstable rankings across platforms. On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference on Networks under Misspecified Exposure Mappings: A Partial Identification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings.</description>

      <title>Factorial Difference-in-Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11937v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate factorial difference-in-differences (FDID), a research design that extends canonical difference-in-differences (DID) to settings in which an event affects all units. In many panel data applications, researchers exploit cross-sectional variation in a baseline factor alongside temporal variation in the event, but the corresponding estimand is often implicit and the justification for applying the DID estimator remains unclear. We frame FDID as a factorial design with two factors, the baseline factor $G$ and the exposure level $Z$, and define effect modification and causal moderation as the associative and causal effects of $G$ on the effect of $Z$, respectively. Under standard DID assumptions of no anticipation and parallel trends, the DID estimator identifies effect modification but not causal moderation. Identifying the latter requires an additional \emph{factorial parallel trends} assumption, that is, mean independence between $G$ and potential outcome trends. We extend the framework to conditionally valid assumptions and regression-based implementations, and further to repeated cross-sectional data and continuous $G$. We demonstrate the framework with an empirical application on the role of social capital in famine relief in China.</description>

      <title>Functional-SVD for Heterogeneous Trajectories: Case Studies in Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03619v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory data, including time series and longitudinal measurements, are increasingly common in health-related domains such as biomedical research and epidemiology. Real-world trajectory data frequently exhibit heterogeneity across subjects such as patients, sites, and subpopulations, yet many traditional methods are not designed to accommodate such heterogeneity in data analysis. To address this, we propose a unified framework, termed Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), for statistical learning with heterogeneous trajectories. We establish the theoretical foundations of FSVD and develop a corresponding estimation algorithm that accommodates noisy and irregular observations. We further adapt FSVD to a wide range of trajectory-learning tasks, including dimension reduction, factor modeling, regression, clustering, and data completion, while preserving its ability to account for heterogeneity, leverage inherent smoothness, and handle irregular sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing approaches across these tasks. Finally, we apply FSVD to a COVID-19 case-count dataset and electronic health record datasets, showcasing its effective performance in global and subgroup pattern discovery and factor analysis.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Missing Data Handling Methods across the Stages of Producing Clinical Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Missing data is a challenge when developing, validating and deploying clinical prediction models (CPMs). Traditionally, decisions concerning missing data handling during CPM development and validation havent accounted for whether missingness is allowed at deployment. We hypothesised that the missing data approach used during model development should optimise model performance upon deployment, whilst the approach used during model validation should yield unbiased predictive performance estimates upon deployment; we term this compatibility. We aimed to determine which combinations of missing data handling methods across the CPM life cycle are compatible. We considered scenarios where CPMs are intended to be deployed with missing data allowed or not, and we evaluated the impact of that choice on earlier modelling decisions. Through a simulation study and an empirical analysis of thoracic surgery data, we compared CPMs developed and validated using combinations of complete case analysis, mean imputation, single regression imputation, multiple imputation, and pattern sub-modelling. If planning to deploy a CPM without allowing missing data, then development and validation should use multiple imputation when required. Where missingness is allowed at deployment, the same imputation method must be used during development and validation. Commonly used combinations of missing data handling methods result in biased predictive performance estimates.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Causal Effects Using Proxies of a Latent Interference Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network interference occurs when treatments assigned to some units affect the outcomes of others. Traditional approaches often assume that the observed network correctly specifies the interference structure. However, in practice, researchers frequently only have access to proxy measurements of the interference network due to limitations in data collection or potential mismatches between measured networks and actual interference pathways. In this paper, we introduce a framework for estimating causal effects when only proxy networks are available. Our approach leverages a structural causal model that accommodates diverse proxy types, including noisy measurements, multiple data sources, and multilayer networks, and defines causal effects as interventions on population-level treatments. The latent nature of the true interference network poses significant challenges. To overcome them, we develop a Bayesian inference framework. We propose a Block Gibbs sampler with Locally Informed Proposals to update the latent network, thereby efficiently exploring the high-dimensional posterior space composed of both discrete and continuous parameters. The latent network updates are driven by information from the proxy networks, treatments, and outcomes. We illustrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering causal effects even when only proxies of the interference network are available.</description>

      <title>Federated Causal Inference from Multi-Site Observational Data via Propensity Score Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inference typically assumes centralized access to individual-level data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites, making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal constraints. We address this problem by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from decentralized observational data via a Federated Learning (FL) approach, allowing inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than individual-level data.
  We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores via a federated weighted average of local scores using Membership Weights (MW), defined as probabilities of site membership conditional on covariates. MW can be flexibly estimated with parametric or non-parametric classification models using standard FL algorithms. The resulting propensity scores are used to construct Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting (Fed-IPW) and Augmented IPW (Fed-AIPW) estimators. In contrast to meta-analysis methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach exploits heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. We show that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions. Theoretical analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate clear advantages over meta-analysis and related approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Block Designs for Order-of-Addition Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designs for Order-of-Addition (OofA) experiments have received growing attention due to their impact on responses based on the sequence of component addition. In certain cases, these experiments involve heterogeneous groups of units, which necessitates the use of blocking to manage variation effects. Despite this, the exploration of block OofA designs remains limited in the literature. As experiments become increasingly complex, addressing this gap is essential to ensure that the designs accurately reflect the effects of the addition sequence and effectively handle the associated variability. Motivated by this, this paper seeks to address the gap by expanding the indicator function framework for block OofA designs. We propose the use of the word length pattern as a criterion for selecting robust block OofA designs. To improve search efficiency and reduce computational demands, we develop algorithms that employ orthogonal Latin squares for design construction and selection, minimizing the need for exhaustive searches. Our analysis, supported by correlation plots, reveals that the algorithms effectively manage confounding and aliasing between effects. Additionally, simulation studies indicate that designs based on our proposed criterion and algorithms achieve power and type I error rates comparable to those of full block OofA designs. This approach offers a practical and efficient method for constructing block OofA designs and may provide valuable insights for future research and applications.</description>

Abstract: The paper analyzes four classical signal-plus-noise models: the factor model, spiked sample covariance matrices, the sum of a Wigner matrix and a low-rank perturbation, and canonical correlation analysis with low-rank dependencies. The objective is to construct confidence intervals for the signal strength that are uniformly valid across all regimes - strong, weak, and critical signals. We demonstrate that traditional Gaussian approximations fail in the critical regime. Instead, we introduce a universal transitional distribution that enables valid inference across the entire spectrum of signal strengths. The approach is illustrated through applications in macroeconomics and finance.</description>

      <title>Causal inference for calibrated scaling interventions on time-to-event processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops a flexible inferential framework for nonparametric causal inference in time-to-event settings, based on stochastic interventions defined through multiplicative scaling of the intensity governing an intermediate event process. These interventions induce a family of estimands indexed by a scalar parameter {\alpha}, representing effects of modifying event rates while preserving the temporal and covariate-dependent structure of the observed data generating mechanism. To enhance interpretability, we introduce calibrated interventions, where {\alpha} is chosen to achieve a pre-specified goal, such as a desired level of cumulative risk of the intermediate event, and define corresponding composite target parameters capturing the downstream effects on the outcome process. This yields clinically meaningful contrasts while avoiding unrealistic deterministic intervention regimes. Under a nonparametric model, we derive efficient influence curves for {\alpha}-indexed, calibrated, and composite target parameters and establish their double robustness properties. We further sketch a targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) strategy that accommodates flexible, machine learning based nuisance estimation. The proposed framework applies broadly to (causal) questions involving time-to-event treatments or mediators and is illustrated through different examples event-history settings. A simulation study demonstrates finite-sample inferential properties, and highlights the implications of practical positivity violations when interventions extend beyond observed data support.</description>

      <title>Inference on the Significance of Modalities in Multimodal Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the popular of multimodal statistical models, there lacks rigorous statistical inference tools for inferring the significance of a single modality within a multimodal model, especially in high-dimensional models. For high-dimensional multimodal generalized linear models, we propose a novel entropy-based metric, called the expected relative entropy, to quantify the information gain of one modality in addition to all other modalities in the model. We propose a deviance-based statistic to estimate the expected relative entropy, prove that it is consistent and its asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a non-central chi-squared distribution. That enables the calculation of confidence intervals and p-values to assess the significance of the expected relative entropy for a given modality. We numerically evaluate the empirical performance of our proposed inference tool by simulations and apply it to a multimodal neuroimaging dataset to demonstrate its good performance on various high-dimensional multimodal generalized linear models.</description>

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving estimation and prediction performance by leveraging information from related datasets, with the offset TL (O-TL) being a prevailing implementation. In this paper, we adapt the control-variates (CVS) method for TL and develop CVS-based estimators for scalar-on-function regression. These estimators rely exclusively on dataset-specific summary statistics, thereby avoiding the pooling of subject-level data and remaining applicable in privacy-restricted or decentralized settings. We establish, for the first time, a theoretical connection between O-TL and CVS-based TL, showing that these two seemingly distinct TL strategies adjust local estimators in fundamentally similar ways. We further derive convergence rates that explicitly account for the unavoidable but typically overlooked smoothing error arising from discretely observed functional predictors, and clarify how similarity among covariance functions across datasets governs the performance of TL. Numerical studies support the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve competitive estimation and prediction performance compared with existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Bias-Reduced Estimation of Finite Mixtures: An Application to Latent Group Structures in Panel Data</title>

Abstract: Finite mixture models are widely used in econometric analyses to capture unobserved heterogeneity. This paper shows that maximum likelihood estimation of finite mixtures of parametric densities can suffer from substantial finite-sample bias in all parameters under mild regularity conditions. The bias arises from the influence of outliers in component densities with unbounded or large support and increases with the degree of overlap among mixture components. I show that maximizing the classification-mixture likelihood function, equipped with a consistent classifier, yields parameter estimates that are less biased than those obtained by standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). I then derive the asymptotic distribution of the resulting estimator and provide conditions under which oracle efficiency is achieved. Monte Carlo simulations show that conventional mixture MLE exhibits pronounced finite-sample bias, which diminishes as the sample size or the statistical distance between component densities tends to infinity. The simulations further show that the proposed estimation strategy generally outperforms standard MLE in finite samples in terms of both bias and mean squared errors under relatively weak assumptions. An empirical application to latent group panel structures using health administrative data shows that the proposed approach reduces out-of-sample prediction error by approximately 17.6% relative to the best results obtained from standard MLE procedures.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Causal Effects of Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of causal effects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as personalized medicine. A powerful approach for this is conformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to model-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal prediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make highly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work, we provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced through propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are valid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential outcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating the derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal prediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for continuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be estimated from data.</description>

      <title>Bias-variance Tradeoff in Tensor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study denoising of a third-order tensor when the ground-truth tensor is not necessarily Tucker low-rank. Specifically, we observe $$ Y=X^\ast+Z\in \mathbb{R}^{p_{1} \times p_{2} \times p_{3}}, $$ where $X^\ast$ is the ground-truth tensor, and $Z$ is the noise tensor. We propose a simple variant of the higher-order tensor SVD estimator $\widetilde{X}$. We show that uniformly over all user-specified Tucker ranks $(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$, $$ \| \widetilde{X} - X^* \|_{ \mathrm{F}}^2 = O \Big( \kappa^2 \Big\{ r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k} \Big\} \; + \; \xi_{(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})}^2\Big) \quad \text{ with high probability.} $$ Here, the bias term $\xi_{(r_1,r_2,r_3)}$ corresponds to the best achievable approximation error of $X^\ast$ over the class of tensors with Tucker ranks $(r_1,r_2,r_3)$; $\kappa^2$ quantifies the noise level; and the variance term $\kappa^2 \{r_{1}r_{2}r_{3}+\sum_{k=1}^{3} p_{k} r_{k}\}$ scales with the effective number of free parameters in the estimator $\widetilde{X}$. Our analysis achieves a clean rank-adaptive bias--variance tradeoff: as we increase the ranks of estimator $\widetilde{X}$, the bias $\xi(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3})$ decreases and the variance increases. As a byproduct we also obtain a convenient bias-variance decomposition for the vanilla low-rank SVD matrix estimators.</description>

      <title>Online Price Competition under Generalized Linear Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10718v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\lambda_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mu_i(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $\mu_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Causal Bounds under Unmeasured Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven information-theoretic framework for sharp partial identification of causal effects under unmeasured confounding. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as bounded or discrete outcomes; require external inputs (for example, instrumental variables, proxies, or user-specified sensitivity parameters); necessitate full structural causal model specifications; or focus solely on population-level averages while neglecting covariate-conditional treatment effects. We overcome all four limitations simultaneously by establishing novel information-theoretic, data-driven divergence bounds. Our key theoretical contribution shows that the f-divergence between the observational distribution P(Y | A = a, X = x) and the interventional distribution P(Y | do(A = a), X = x) is upper bounded by a function of the propensity score alone. This result enables sharp partial identification of conditional causal effects directly from observational data, without requiring external sensitivity parameters, auxiliary variables, full structural specifications, or outcome boundedness assumptions. For practical implementation, we develop a semiparametric estimator satisfying Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), which ensures square-root-n consistent inference even when nuisance functions are estimated using flexible machine learning methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications, implemented in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/yonghanjung/Information-Theretic-Bounds), demonstrate that our framework provides tight and valid causal bounds across a wide range of data-generating processes.</description>
