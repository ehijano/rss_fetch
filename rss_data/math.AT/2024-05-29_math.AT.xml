      <title>Parametrised Poincar\'e duality and equivariant fixed points methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce and develop the notion of parametrised Poincar\'{e} duality in the formalism of parametrised higher category theory by Martini-Wolf, in part generalising Cnossen's theory of twisted ambidexterity to the nonpresentable setting. We prove several basechange results, allowing us to move between different coefficient categories and ambient topoi. We then specialise the general framework to yield a good theory of equivariant Poincar\'{e} duality spaces for compact Lie groups and apply our basechange results to obtain a suite of isotropy separation methods. Finally, we employ this theory to perform various categorical Smith-theoretic manoeuvres to prove, among other things, a generalisation of a theorem of Atiyah-Bott and Conner-Floyd on group actions with single fixed points.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation : Beyond Plug-in Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) used to summarize the topology underlying data. It can be conveniently represented through persistence diagrams. Observing a noisy signal, common strategies to infer its persistence diagram involve plug-in estimators, and convergence properties are then derived from sup-norm stability. This dependence on the sup-norm convergence of the preliminary estimator is restrictive, as it essentially imposes to consider regular classes of signals. Departing from these approaches, we design an estimator based on image persistence. In the context of the Gaussian white noise model, and for large classes of piecewise-H\"older signals, we prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and achieves minimax rates. Notably, these rates coincide with the well known minimax rates for H\"older continuous signals.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional half-harmonic maps into the circle and their degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a half-harmonic map $u\in \dot H^{\frac{1}{2},2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{S}^1)$ minimizing the fractional Dirichlet energy under Dirichlet boundary conditions in $\mathbb{R}\setminus I$, we show the existence of a second half-harmonic map, minimizing the Dirichlet energy in a different homotopy class. This is a first step towards addressing a problem raised by Brezis and is based on the study of the degree of fractional Sobolev maps and a sharp estimate \`a la Brezis-Coron. We give examples showing that it is in general not possible to minimize in every homotopy class and show a contrast with the 2-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Structures in Symplectic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Cohen-Jones-Segal construction of stable homotopy types associated to flow categories of Morse-Smale functions $f$ to the setting where $f$ is equivariant under a finite group action and is Morse but no longer Morse-Smale. This setting occurs universally, as equivariant Morse functions can rarely be perturbed to nearby equivariant Morse-Smale functions. The method is very general, and allows one to do equivariant Floer theory while avoiding all the complications typically caused by issues of equivariant transversality. The construction assigns a (genuine) equivariant orthogonal spectrum to an equivariant framed virtually smooth flow category. Using this method, we construct, for a compact symplectic manifold $M$, which is symplectically atoroidal with contact boundary, and is equipped with an equivariant trivialization of its polarization class, a cyclotomic structure on the spectral lift of the symplectic cohomology $SH^*(M)$. This generalizes a variant of the map which sends loops to their $p$-fold covers on free loop spaces to the setting of general Liouville domains, and suggests a systematic connection between Floer homology and $p$-adic Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Non-accessible localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 2005 paper, Casacuberta, Scevenels and Smith construct a homotopy idempotent functor $E$ on the category of simplicial sets with the property that whether it can be expressed as localization with respect to a map $f$ is independent of the ZFC axioms. We show that this construction can be carried out in homotopy type theory. More precisely, we give a general method of associating to a suitable (possibly large) family of maps, a reflective subuniverse of any universe $\mathcal{U}$. When specialized to an appropriate family, this produces a localization which when interpreted in the $\infty$-topos of spaces agrees with the localization corresponding to $E$. Our approach generalizes the approach of [CSS] in two ways. First, by working in homotopy type theory, our construction can be interpreted in any $\infty$-topos. Second, while the local objects produced by [CSS] are always 1-types, our construction can produce $n$-types, for any $n$. This is new, even in the $\infty$-topos of spaces. In addition, by making use of universes, our proof is very direct.
  Along the way, we prove many results about "small" types that are of independent interest. As an application, we give a new proof that separated localizations exist. We also give results that say when a localization with respect to a family of maps can be presented as localization with respect to a single map, and show that the simplicial model satisfies a strong form of the axiom of choice which implies that sets cover and that the law of excluded middle holds.</description>

      <title>On Postnikov completeness for replete topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the hypercomplete $\infty$-topos associated with any replete topos is Postnikov complete, positively answering a question of Bhatt and Scholze; this will be deduced from the Milnor sequences for sheaves of spaces on replete topoi that we construct. As a corollary, we generalize a result of To\"en on affine stacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Church-Farb-Putman formulated stability and vanishing conjectures for the high-dimensional cohomology of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, surface mapping class groups and automorphism groups of free groups.
