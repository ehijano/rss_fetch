      <title>Semiparametric Single-Index Estimation for Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method to estimate the average treatment effect under the assumption of unconfoundedness given observational data. Our estimation method alleviates misspecification issues of the propensity score function by estimating the single-index link function involved through Hermite polynomials. Our approach is computationally tractable and allows for moderately large dimension covariates. We provide the large sample properties of the estimator and show its validity. Also, the average treatment effect estimator achieves the parametric rate and asymptotic normality. Our extensive Monte Carlo study shows that the proposed estimator is valid in finite samples. Applying our method to maternal smoking and infant health, we find that conventional estimates of smoking's impact on birth weight may be biased due to propensity score misspecification, and our analysis of job training programs reveals earnings effects that are more precisely estimated than in prior work. These applications demonstrate how addressing model misspecification can substantively affect our understanding of key policy-relevant treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Causal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The credibility revolution advances the use of research designs that permit identification and estimation of causal effects. However, understanding which mechanisms produce measured causal effects remains a challenge. A dominant current approach to the quantitative evaluation of mechanisms relies on the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to pre-treatment covariates. This paper develops a framework to understand when the existence of such heterogeneous treatment effects can support inferences about the activation of a mechanism. We show first that this design cannot provide evidence of mechanism activation without an additional, generally implicit, assumption. Further, even when this assumption is satisfied, if a measured outcome is produced by a non-linear transformation of a directly-affected outcome of theoretical interest, heterogeneous treatment effects are not informative of mechanism activation. We provide novel guidance for interpretation and research design in light of these findings.</description>

      <title>Estimating Time-Varying Parameters of Various Smoothness in Linear Models via Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider estimating nonparametric time-varying parameters in linear models using kernel regression. Our contributions are twofold. First, we consider a broad class of time-varying parameters including deterministic smooth functions, the rescaled random walk, structural breaks, the threshold model and their mixtures. We show that those time-varying parameters can be consistently estimated by kernel regression. Our analysis exploits the smoothness of the time-varying parameter quantified by a single parameter. The second contribution is to reveal that the bandwidth used in kernel regression determines the trade-off between the rate of convergence and the size of the class of time-varying parameters that can be estimated. We demonstrate that an improper choice of the bandwidth yields biased estimation, and argue that the bandwidth should be selected according to the smoothness of the time-varying parameters. An empirical application shows that the kernel-based estimator with a particular bandwidth choice can capture the random-walk dynamics in time-varying parameters.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Deep Neural Networks with Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</description>
