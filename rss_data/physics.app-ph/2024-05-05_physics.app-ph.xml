      <title>Foundry's perspective on laser and SOA module integration with silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonic integrated circuit (PIC) builds on the demand for a low cost approach from established silicon-based manufacturing infrastructure traditionally built for electronics. Besides its natural abundance, silicon has desirable properties such as optically low loss (at certain critical wavelengths), and small form factor to enable high density scaled-up optical on-chip circuitry. However, given its indirect bandgap, the platform is typically integrated with other direct bandgap (e.g., III-V semiconductor) platforms for on-chip light source. An effective solution to integrating light source onto silicon photonics platform is integral to a practical scaled-up and full-fledged integrated photonics implementation. Here, we discuss the integration solutions, and present our foundry's perspective toward realizing it.</description>

      <title>Progress in multijunction solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advanced multijunction solar cell (MJSC) has emerged as a frontrunner with higher efficiency in photovoltaic literature. It started its journey with a modest 20% efficient tandem solar cell, and today, it has reached an impressive 47.1% photoconversion efficiency (PCE) with six junction combinations. Since the early 1990s, these solar cells have been utilised for space applications. Recently, there has been a trend of using this genre for terrestrial applications as well. However, the complexity and high cost of the fabrication procedure have been the significant challenges over the last three decades. The photovoltaic (PV) community has witnessed a variety of fabrication approaches to address these hurdles. This paper reviews the progression of computational and experimental research approaches of III-V MJSCs and their fabrication processes. In addition, it addresses the barriers hindering the progress of these cells and their prospects. This review gathers insights from a handful number of articles on III-V MJSCs to provide a comprehensive guide for the new entrants, experts and practitioners about the research methodologies, growth techniques, current status, challenges, and opportunities in a timely and conscious manner.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectric microresonators for sensitive spin detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric microresonators are indispensable in wireless communications, and underpin radio frequency filtering in mobile phones. These devices are usually analyzed in the quasi-(electro)static regime with the magnetic field effectively ignored. On the other hand, at GHz frequencies and especially in piezoelectric devices exploiting strong dimensional confinement of acoustic fields, the surface magnetic fields ($B_{1}$) can be significant. This $B_1$ field, which oscillates at GHz frequencies, but is confined to ${\mu}$m-scale wavelengths provides a natural route to efficiently interface with nanoscale spin systems. We show through scaling arguments that $B_1{\propto}f^2$ for tightly focused acoustic fields at a given operation frequency $f$. We demonstrate the existence of these surface magnetic fields in a proof-of-principle experiment by showing excess power absorption at the focus of a surface acoustic wave (SAW), when a polished Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) sphere is positioned in the evanescent field, and the magnon resonance is tuned across the SAW transmission. Finally, we outline the prospects for sensitive spin detection using small mode volume piezoelectric microresonators, including the feasibility of electrical detection of single spins at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Reversible single-pulse laser-induced phase change of Sb$_2$S$_3$ thin films: multi-physics modeling and experimental demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) have gained a tremendous interest as a means to actively tune nanophotonic devices through the large optical modulation produced by their amorphous to crystalline reversible transition. Recently, materials such as Sb$_2$S$_3$ emerged as particularly promising low loss PCMs, with both large refractive index modulations and transparency in the visible and NIR. Controlling the local and reversible phase transition in this material is of major importance for future applications, and an appealing method to do so is to exploit pulsed lasers. Yet, the physics and limits involved in the optical switching of Sb$_2$S$_3$ are not yet well understood. Here, we investigate the reversible laser-induced phase transition of Sb$_2$S$_3$, focusing specifically on the mechanisms that drive the optically induced amorphization, with multi-physics considerations including the optical and thermal properties of the PCM and its environment. We theoretically and experimentally determine the laser energy threshold for reversibly changing the phase of the PCM, not only between fully amorphous and crystalline states but also between partially recrystallized states. We then reveal the non-negligible impact of the material's polycrystallinity and anisotropy on the power thresholds for optical switching. Finally, we address the challenges related to laser amorphization of thick Sb$_2$S$_3$ layers, as well as strategies to overcome them. These results enable a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the physics behind the optically-induced reversible change of phase in Sb$_2$S$_3$ layers.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>Performance of Superconducting Resonators Suspended on SiN Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated errors in superconducting circuits due to nonequilibrium quasiparticles are a notable concern in efforts to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing. The propagation of quasiparticles causing these correlated errors can potentially be mediated by phonons in the substrate. Therefore, methods that decouple devices from the substrate are possible solutions, such as isolating devices atop SiN membranes. In this work, we validate the compatibility of SiN membrane technology with high quality superconducting circuits, adding the technique to the community's fabrication toolbox. We do so by fabricating superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators entirely atop a thin ($\sim$110 nm) SiN layer, where the bulk Si originally supporting it has been etched away, achieving a suspended membrane where the shortest length to its thickness yields an aspect ratio of approximately $7.4 \times 10^3$. We compare these membrane resonators to on-substrate resonators on the same chip, finding similar internal quality factors $\sim$$10^5$ at single photon levels. Furthermore, we confirm that these membranes do not adversely affect the resonator thermalization rate. With these important benchmarks validated, this technique can be extended to qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions are an emerging class of structured light with sophisticated particle-like topologies with great potential for revolutionizing modern informatics. However, the current generation of optical skyrmions involves complex or bulky systems, hindering their development of practical applications. Here, exploiting the emergent "lab-on-fiber" technology, we demonstrate the design of a metafiber-integrated photonic skyrmion generator. We not only successfully generated high-quality optical skyrmions from metafibers, but also experimentally verified their remarkable properties, such as regulability and topological stability with deep-subwavelength features beyond the diffraction limits. Our flexible and fiber-integrated optical skyrmions platform paves the avenue for future applications of topologically-enhanced remote super-resolution microscopy and super-robust information transfer.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of spin wave imaging using nitrogen vacancy centers and time resolved magneto-optical measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin waves, the fundamental excitations in magnetic materials, are promising candidates for realizing low-dissipation information processing in spintronics. The ability to visualize and manipulate coherent spin-wave transport is crucial for the development of spin wave-based devices. We use a recently discovered method utilizing nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, point defects in the diamond lattice, to measure spin waves in thin film magnetic insulators by detecting their magnetic stray field. We experimentally demonstrate enhanced contrast in the detected wavefront amplitudes by imaging spin waves underneath a reference stripline and phenomenologically model the results. By extracting the spin wave dispersion and comparing NV center based spin wave measurements to spin wave imaging conducted through the well-established time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we discuss the advantages and limitations of employing NV centers as spin wave sensors.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Graphene-On-Silicon Nitride Integrated Waveguide Dual-Mode Electro-Absorption Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, simulation and optimization of a graphene-on-silicon nitride (GOSiN) integrated waveguide dual-mode electro-absorption modulator operating with a speed between 27-109 GHz and an energy consumption below 6 pJ/bit. This device individually modulates the TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ modes in a single-arm dual-mode waveguide with modulation depths up to 316 dB/cm and 273 dB/cm, respectively. It has promising applications in Multimode Division Multiplexing (MDM) systems, where single-mode modulation induces high losses and costs. We have started from the design of GOSiN TE$_0$ and TE$_1$ passive low-loss mode filters. Then, applying a gate voltage to graphene via transparent IHO electrodes, we have combined both filters and shown that the light absorption can be modulated to obtain four logical values in transmission: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Our proposed devices can potentially boost the development of efficient MDM systems for ultra-fast on-chip interconnections.</description>

      <title>Design rules for controlling active topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects play a central role in the physics of many materials, including magnets, superconductors and liquid crystals. In active fluids, defects become autonomous particles that spontaneously propel from internal active stresses and drive chaotic flows stirring the fluid. The intimate connection between defect textures and active flow suggests that properties of active materials can be engineered by controlling defects, but design principles for their spatiotemporal control remain elusive. Here we propose a symmetry-based additive strategy for using elementary activity patterns, as active topological tweezers, to create, move and braid such defects. By combining theory and simulations, we demonstrate how, at the collective level, spatial activity gradients act like electric fields which, when strong enough, induce an inverted topological polarization of defects, akin to a negative susceptibility dielectric. We harness this feature in a dynamic setting to collectively pattern and transport interacting active defects. Our work establishes an additive framework to sculpt flows and manipulate active defects in both space and time, paving the way to design programmable active and living materials for transport, memory and logic.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fiber photometry is a significantly less invasive method compared to other deep brain imaging microendoscopy approaches due to the use of thin multimode fibers (MMF diameter $&lt;$ 500 $\mu$m). Nevertheless, the transmitted signals get scrambled upon propagation within the MMF, thus limiting the technique's potential in resolving temporal readouts with cellular resolution. Here, we demonstrate how to separate the time trace signals of several fluorescent sources probed by a thin ($\approx$ 200 $\mu$m) MMF with typical implantable length in a mouse brain. We disentangled several spatio-temporal fluorescence signals by using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that commercial and low-cost open-source miniscopes display enough sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof of principle experiment, suggesting that a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies with multimode fibers in freely-behaving mice could be possible.</description>
