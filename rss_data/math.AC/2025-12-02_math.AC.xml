      <title>When is the relative Frobenius an isomorphism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field extension $L/K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ is formally \'etale if and only if the relative Frobenius of $L/K$ is an isomorphism. Inspired by this classical result, we explore whether the formally \'etale property for a map $R \to S$ of $\mathbf{F}_p$-algebras is characterized by isomorphism of the relative Frobenius $F_{S/R}$. While $F_{S/R}$ being an isomorphism implies $R \to S$ is formally \'etale, the converse fails in the non-Noetherian setting. Thus, following Morrow, we introduce an enhancement of the formally \'etale property that we call b-nil (bounded nil) formally \'etale, and we show that $F_{S/R}$ is an isomorphism precisely when $R \to S$ is b-nil formally \'etale. The b-nil formally \'etale property is quite different from the formally \'etale property. For instance, we show that any b-nil formally \'etale algebra over an $F$-pure ring is reduced, whereas non-reduced formally \'etale algebras exist over $\mathbf{F}_p$ by a construction of Bhatt. We also show that the b-nil formally \'etale property neither implies nor is implied by having a trivial cotangent complex. We explore when formally \'etale implies b-nil formally \'etale in prime characteristic. The known cases mainly arise from the fact that a weakly \'etale map has isomorphic relative Frobenius. We record two additional cases that may be of interest. The first is for a map $R \to S$ of $F$-finite rings such that $S$ has finitely presented absolute Frobenius. Secondly, we show that any formally \'etale map of Noetherian rings of prime characteristic is b-nil formally \'etale.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and grade of Hilbert polynomial of invariant rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and let $V$ be a $k$-vector space of dimension $d$. Let $G \subseteq GL(V)$ be a finite group. Let $r = \dim_k (V^*)^G$. Assume $r \geq 1$. Let $R = k[V]^G$ be the ring of invariants of $G$. Let $H_R(n) = a_{d-1}(n)n^{d-1} + \cdots a_1(n)n + a_0(n)$ be the Hilbert polynomial of $R$ where $a_i(-)$ are periodic functions. We show
  $a_{d-1}(-), \ldots, a_{d-r}(-)$ are constants. In the terminology of Erhart, $\text{grade} H_R \leq d - r-1$. We also give an example which shows that our result is sharp.</description>

      <title>Grade three perfect ideals and length four self-dual resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with a grade three perfect ideal $I \subset R$, we demonstrate how to produce the a self-dual resolution of length four using the resolution of the original ideal. This process is also reversible. The main case of interest is when the grade three perfect ideal has type two, so the output complex resolves $R/J$ for a grade four Gorenstein ideal $J$. This suggests that the structure theory of these two families of ideals should be closely related.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the upper bound conjecture proposed by Saeedi Madani \&amp; Kiani on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of generalized binomial edge ideals. We give a combinatorial upper bound of regularity for generalized binomial edge ideals, which is better than the bound claimed in that conjecture. Also, we show that the bound is tight by providing an infinite class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Divisibility Relations and $\mathcal{D}$-Extremal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A divisibility relation between the generators of a square-free monomial ideal formally encodes the situation when one generator divides the least common multiple of some other generators. The divisibility relations contribute to the deletion of some parts of the Taylor resolution of the ideal, and therefore lead to finding a resolution closer to the minimal one. Motivated by this observation, for a given set $\mathcal{D}$ of divisibility relations, we study all square-free monomials satisfying the relations in $\mathcal{D}$. We define a class of square-free monomial ideals called $\mathcal{D}$-extremal ideals $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$ , and show it is optimal in the sense that it is an ideal satisfying exactly those divisibility relations coming from $\mathcal{D}$, and no others. We then show that $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$ is extremal in the sense that the resolution and betti numbers of the powers of any square-free monomial ideal satisfying the relations in $\mathcal{D}$ are bounded by those of the same powers of $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the squarefree powers of facet ideals associated with simplicial trees. Specifically, we examine the linearity of their minimal free resolution and their regularity. Additionally, we investigate when the first syzygy module of squarefree powers of a simplicial tree is generated by linear relations. Finally, we provide a combinatorial formula for the regularity of the squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals of path graphs.</description>

      <title>Some new Betti numbers of ideals generated by n+1 generic forms in n variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very little is known on the Hilbert series of graded algebras $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_r)$, $r&gt;n$, $g_i$ generic form of degree $e_i$, in general. One instance when the series is known, is for $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables, \cite{St}. Of course even less is known about Betti numbers. There are some general results on the Betti table by Pardue and Richert in \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and by Diem in \cite{Di}. Then there are results on Betti numbers in the case $n+1$ relations in $n$ variables, described below, by Migliore and Mir\`o-Roig in \cite{Mi-Mi}, and more partial results in the general case by the same authors in \cite{Mi-Mi1}. In this paper we consider the same case as in \cite{Mi-Mi}, $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables. Our results can be described as follows. We can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $g_i$ generic, at least if $\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\deg(g_i)-n$ is even, often in more cases. Thus, given {\em any} set $\{ e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$, $e_i\ge2$ for all $i$, such that $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $i=1,\ldots,n$, we get many numbers $D_j$, so that we can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $1\le i\le n$, $\deg(g_{n+1})=D_j$. The main ingredients of the proof is a theorem by Pardue and Richert, \cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and later by Diem,\cite{Di}, and a new short proof of a theorem on Hilbert series of artinian complete intersections by Reid, Roberts, and Roitman, \cite{R-R-R}. We also give examples of algebras with many so called "ghost terms" in the minimal resolution.</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that for a monomial ideal $I$, the number of minimal generators, $\mu(I^n)$, eventually follows a polynomial pattern for increasing $n$. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. Let $s\ge \mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is a constant bounded above by the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the set $\mathsf{G}(I)$ of minimal generators of $I$. We show that every higher power $I^{s+\ell}$ for any $\ell \ge 0$ can be constructed from certain subideals of $I^s$. This provides an explicit description of~$\mathsf{G}(I^{s+\ell})$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$. Given $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, this construction significantly reduces computational complexity in determining larger powers of~$I$. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <title>Cuts of an ordered abelian group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the cuts of a totally ordered abelian group $\Gamma$. We begin by recalling some results on ordered sets I and on the associated sets IS(I) and FS(I) of initial and final segments of I.  For a totally ordered set I we review the notion of an I-structure defined on a module over a ring R, and the definition of the Hahn product of a family of R-modules indexed by I.  The set Cv($\Gamma$)of convex subgroups of a totally ordered group $\Gamma$ is also a totally ordered set, canonically isomorphic to the set of cuts of the subset Pr($\Gamma$)of principal convex subgroups. One of the first results is then to equip the group $\Gamma$ with an I-structure where I is the set Pr($\Gamma$) endowed with the opposite order.  We associate a convex subgroup with every cut of the group $\Gamma$, and conversely, we can associate a family of cuts with every convex subgroup of $\Gamma$. It is by looking at these subgroups, and the I-structure of $\Gamma$ that we can obtain a classification of the different types of cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homological shift algebra and the projective dimension function of complementary edge ideals are investigated. Let $G$ be a connected graph, and let $I$ be its complementary edge ideal. For bipartite graphs $G$, we show that the projective dimension of $I^s$ increases strictly with $s$ until reaching its maximum value. For trees and cycles, explicit expressions for the projective dimension of $I^s$ are provided, along with detailed descriptions of their homological shift algebras. In particular, it is shown that the $i$-th homological shift algebra of such ideals is generated in degree at most $i$. Additionally, we prove that if $G$ is a tree, then the homological shift ideal $\mathrm{HS}_i(I^i)$, when divided by a suitable monomial, becomes a Veronese-type ideal, and every Veronese-type ideal arises in this manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study rooted products of graphs from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. For edge ideals, we introduce the 2-Cohen-Macaulayness with respect to a vertex and use it to investigate when edge ideals of rooted products of graphs are Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we completely determine when attaching a graph on at most six vertices to a given graph as rooted products, yields a Cohen-Macaulay edge ideal. Also, we define mulit-clique corona graphs as a generalization of clique-corona graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique corona graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. Also, we give formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}(RC)$ be the derived category of representations of a small category $C$ over a commutative noetherian ring $R$. We study the homotopically smashing t-structures on this category. Specifying our discussion to the stalk categories $\Gamma_{\mathfrak{p}}\mathcal{D}(RQ)$ for a finite quiver $Q$ and a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $R$, we prove the telescope conjecture for the derived category of representations of finite quivers over artinian rings. More generally, we prove the same result also outside of the noetherian context, for representations of finite quivers over commutative perfect rings.</description>
