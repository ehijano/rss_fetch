      <title>Did the Big Bang and cosmic inflation really happen? (A tale of alternative cosmological models)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular science article designed to introduce people familiar with basic cosmological nomenclature with models alternative to cosmological inflation. The paper briefly discusses the modern view of the Big Bang model, inflation (both its advantages and potential deficiencies). This is followed by a discussion of historical alternative models and modern approaches such as matter bounce, ekpyrotic Universe, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, Hartle-Hawking state and loop quantum cosmology. The final aspect of the paper is to present the advantages and potential problems associated with alternative models and to present the conceptual challenges associated with the uniqueness of cosmology as a specific domain of physics.</description>

      <title>Maximum Expected Reward Lines If Non Specialist (for darts)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owning up to the authors' occasional mixed performances when playing darts we follow up on the ingenious work to determine the optimal aim to score high by Tibshirani et. al [JRS A 174, 213 (2011)] and expand on maximal expected reward lines assuming spread profiles beyond the standard case of an isotropic distribution by investigating situations in which a players' aiming quality differs in horizontal and vertical direction, arguably representing more realistic profiles. To render the theoretical findings applicable, we determine regions $\Gamma$ on the dart board that may serve as an aid to players in order to maximise their score depending on whether said areas are hit sufficiently often. Lastly we compare all three strategies with the simple approaches to always aim for triple 20 or bulls eye respectively, probing their usefulness.</description>
