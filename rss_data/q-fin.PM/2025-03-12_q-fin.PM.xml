      <title>Dynamically optimal portfolios for monotone mean--variance preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monotone mean-variance (MMV) utility is the minimal modification of the classical Markowitz utility that respects rational ordering of investment opportunities. This paper provides, for the first time, a complete characterization of optimal dynamic portfolio choice for the MMV utility in asset price models with independent returns. The task is performed under minimal assumptions, weaker than the existence of an equivalent martingale measure and with no restrictions on the moments of asset returns. We interpret the maximal MMV utility in terms of the monotone Sharpe ratio (MSR) and show that the global squared MSR arises as the nominal yield from continuously compounding at the rate equal to the maximal local squared MSR. The paper gives simple necessary and sufficient conditions for mean-variance (MV) efficient portfolios to be MMV efficient. Several illustrative examples contrasting the MV and MMV criteria are provided.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Correlation Models for the Cross-Section of Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note discusses some of the aspects of a model for the covariance of equity returns based on a simple "isotropic" structure in which all pairwise correlations are taken to be the same value. The effect of the structure on feasible values for the common correlation of returns and on the "effective degrees of freedom" within the equity cross-section are discussed, as well as the impact of this constraint on the asymptotic Normality of portfolio returns. An eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is presented and used to partition variance into that from a common "market" factor and "non-diversifiable" idiosyncratic risk. A empirical analysis of the recent history of the returns of S&amp;P 500 Index members is presented and compared to the expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis supports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence in support of linear factor models. Analysis of portfolio selection under isotropic correlation is presented using mean-variance optimization for both heteroskedastic and homoskedastic cases. Portfolio selection for negative exponential utility maximizers is also discussed for the general case of distributions of returns with elliptical symmetry. The fact that idiosyncratic risk may not be removed by diversification in a model that the data supports undermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T. If the cross-section of equity returns is more accurately described by this structure then an inevitable consequence is that picking stocks is not a "pointless" activity, as the returns to residual risk would be non-zero.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data follows a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updates this coefficient over time, forming a dynamic strategy that approaches the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies can be universally guaranteed under stationary stochastic markets. Furthermore, in certain time-reversible stochastic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on past market information during investment, does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>
