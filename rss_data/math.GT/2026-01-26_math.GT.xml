      <title>Signs of knot polynomial evaluations from a topological perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for knots, the evaluation of the Jones polynomial at the sixth root of unity, as well as the evaluation of the $Q$-polynomial at the reciprocal of the golden ratio, are uniquely determined by the oriented homeomorphism type of the double branched covering. We provide explicit formulae for these evaluations in terms of the linking pairing. The proof proceeds via so-called singular determinants, from which we also extract new lower bounds for the unknotting numbers of knots and links.</description>

      <title>Tautological classes for (n,n+1) torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an explicit isomorphism between the HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and the direct sum of hook isotypic components of the space of diagonal coinvariants. As a consequence, we compute the action of tautological classes in HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and prove that it extends to an action of the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane. We also compute the action of differentials $d_N$ in Rasmussen spectral sequences from HOMLFY-PT to $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving UMAP with Geometric and Topological Priors: The JORC-UMAP Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.</description>

      <title>Oka and Alexander polynomials of symplectic curves and divisibility relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove Libgober's divisibility relations for Oka and Alexander polynomials of symplectic curves in the complex projective plane. Along the way, we give new proofs of the divisibility relations for the Alexander polynomials of complex algebraic curves with respect to a generic line at infinity.</description>

      <title>Computing colored Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincar\'e series of the skein lasagna module of $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of boundary orbits (separatrices) of canonical regions (basins/neighbourhoods of equilibria) in holomorphic flows with real-valued time. We establish the continuity of transit times along these boundary orbits and classify possible path components of the boundary of flow-invariant domains. Thus, we provide central tools for topological and geometric constructions aimed at examining the role of blow-up scenarios in separatrix configurations of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors: First, we prove that the separatrices of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices with a blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time. Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in ["The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows", K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions. Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>
