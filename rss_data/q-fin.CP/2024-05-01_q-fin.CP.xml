      <title>The Effect of Data Types' on the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Financial Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting cryptocurrencies as a financial issue is crucial as it provides investors with possible financial benefits. A small improvement in forecasting performance can lead to increased profitability; therefore, obtaining a realistic forecast is very important for investors. Successful forecasting provides traders with effective buy-or-hold strategies, allowing them to make more profits. The most important thing in this process is to produce accurate forecasts suitable for real-life applications. Bitcoin, frequently mentioned recently due to its volatility and chaotic behavior, has begun to pay great attention and has become an investment tool, especially during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provided a comprehensive methodology, including constructing continuous and trend data using one and seven years periods of data as inputs and applying machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast Bitcoin price movement. A binarization procedure was applied using continuous data to construct the trend data representing each input feature trend. Following the related literature, the input features are determined as technical indicators, google trends, and the number of tweets. Random forest (RF), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost-XGB), Support vector machine (SVM) Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were applied on the selected features for prediction purposes. This work investigates two main research questions: i. How does the sample size affect the prediction performance of ML algorithms? ii. How does the data type affect the prediction performance of ML algorithms? Accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were used to compare the model performance. A t-test was performed to test the statistical significance of the prediction results.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse $Z$-transform and Wiener-Hopf factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest new closely related methods for numerical inversion of $Z$-transform and Wiener-Hopf factorization of functions on the unit circle, based on sinh-deformations of the contours of integration, corresponding changes of variables and the simplified trapezoid rule. As applications, we consider evaluation of high moments of probability distributions and construction of causal filters. Programs in Matlab running on a Mac with moderate characteristics achieves the precision E-14 in several dozen of microseconds and E-11 in several milliseconds, respectively.</description>
