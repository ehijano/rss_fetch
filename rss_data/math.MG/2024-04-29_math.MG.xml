      <title>A Constructive Real Projective Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical theory of plane projective geometry is examined constructively, using both synthetic and analytic methods. The topics include Desargues's Theorem, harmonic conjugates, projectivities, involutions, conics, Pascal's Theorem, poles and polars. The axioms used for the synthetic treatment are constructive versions of the traditional axioms. The analytic construction is used to verify the consistency of the axioms; it is based on the usual model in three-dimensional Euclidean space, using only constructive properties of the real numbers. The methods of strict constructivism, following principles put forward by Errett Bishop, reveal the hidden constructive content of a portion of classical geometry. A number of open problems remain for future studies.</description>

      <title>Detecting fast vanishing loops in complex-analytic germs (and detecting germs that are inner metrically conical)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X be a reduced complex-analytic germ of pure dimension n\ge2, with arbitrary singularities (not necessarily normal or complete intersection). Various homology cycles on Link_\ep[X] vanish at different speeds when \ep\to0. We give a condition ensuring fast vanishing loops on X. The condition is in terms of the discriminant and the covering data for "convenient" coverings X\to (C^n,o). No resolution of singularities is involved.
  For surface germs (n=2) this condition becomes necessary and sufficient.
  A corollary for surface germs that are strictly complete intersections detects fast loops via singularities of the projectivized tangent cone of X.
  Fast loops are the simplest obstructions for X to be inner metrically conical. Hence we get simple necessary conditions to the IMC property. For normal surface germs these conditions are also sufficient.
  We give numerous classes of non-IMC germs and IMC germs.</description>

      <title>Besicovitch's 1/2 problem and linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following classical conjecture of Besicovitch: a $1$-dimensional Borel set in the plane with finite Hausdorff $1$-dimensional measure $\mathcal{H}^1$ which has lower density strictly larger than $\frac{1}{2}$ almost everywhere must be countably rectifiable. We improve the best known bound, due to Preiss and Ti\v{s}er, showing that the statement is indeed true if $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced by $\frac{7}{10}$ (in fact we improve the Preiss-Ti\v{s}er bound even for the corresponding statement in general metric spaces). More importantly, we propose a family of variational problems to produce the latter and many other similar bounds and we study several properties of them, paving the way for further improvements.</description>

      <title>On coarse embeddings of amenable groups into hyperbolic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove that if a finitely generated amenable group admits a regular map to a direct product of a hyperbolic space and a euclidean space, then it must be virtually nilpotent. We deduce that an amenable group regularly embeds into a hyperbolic group if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, answering a question of Hume and Sisto. We describe an application to Lorentz geometry due to Charles Frances.</description>

      <title>Are all Weakly Convex and Decomposable Polyhedral Surfaces Infinitesimally Rigid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is conjectured that all decomposable (i.e. interior can be triangulated without adding new vertices) polyhedra with vertices in convex position are infinitesimally rigid and only recently has it been shown that this is indeed true under an additional assumption of codecomposability (i.e. the interior of the difference between the convex hull and the polyhedron itself can be triangulated without adding new vertices).
  One major set of tools for studying infinitesimal rigidity happens to be throughout the (negative) Hessian $M_T$ of the discrete Hilbert-Einstein functional. Besides its theoretical importance, it provides the necessary machinery to tackle the problem experimentally. To search for potential counterexamples to the conjecture, one constructs an explicit family of so-called $T$-polyhedra, all of which are weakly convex and decomposable, while being non-codecomposable. Since infinitesimal rigidity is equivalent to a non-degenerate $M_T$, one can let Mathematica search for the eigenvalues of $M_T$ and gather experimental evidence that such a flexible, weakly convex and decomposable $T$-polyhedron may not exist.</description>

      <title>Coarse geometry of quasi-transitive graphs beyond planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08902v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>

      <title>The tangent space in sub-Finsler geometry and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tangent space to a sub-Finsler manifold in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense. We prove that the metric tangent is described by the nilpotent approximation, generalizing the sub-Riemannian result. Additionally, we study the blow-up of a measure on a sub-Finsler manifold. We identify the new notion of bounded measure which ensures that, in the limit, the blow-up is a scalar multiple of the Lebesgue measure. Our results have applications in the study of the Lott-Sturm-Villani curvature-dimension condition in sub-Finsler manifolds. In particular, we show the failure of the CD condition in equiregular sub-Finsler manifolds with growth vector (2,3), equipped with a bounded measure.</description>
