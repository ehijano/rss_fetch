      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results imply that the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run can potentially be refined to be an order of magnitude stronger. We also study the impact of jittering on the sensitivity of resonant experiments more broadly. Interestingly, we find that, depending on the nature of the relevant noise sources, jittering can actually enhance the sensitivity by introducing distinct spectral features into the response of the system. In future work, we will explore how resonant experiments may benefit from introducing frequency modulation into their system.</description>

      <title>Antenna Arrays for CRES-based Neutrino Mass Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRES is a technique for precision measurements of kinetic energies of charged particles, pioneered by the Project 8 experiment to measure the neutrino mass using the tritium endpoint method. It was recently employed for the first time to measure the molecular tritium spectrum and place a limit on the neutrino mass using a cm$^3$-scale detector. Future direct neutrino mass experiments are developing the technique to overcome the systematic and statistical limitations of current detectors. This paper describes one such approach, namely the use of antenna arrays for CRES in free space. Phenomenology, detector design, simulation, and performance estimates are discussed, culminating with an example design with a projected sensitivity of $m_{\beta} &lt; 0.04 \ \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. Prototype antenna array measurements are also shown for a demonstrator-scale setup as a benchmark for the simulation. By consolidating these results, this paper serves as a comprehensive reference for the development and performance of antenna arrays for CRES.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive radon assay using an electrostatic chamber in a recirculating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare event searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay and Weakly Interacting Massive Particle detection require ultra-low background detectors. Radon contamination is a significant challenge for these experiments, which employ highly sensitive radon assay techniques to identify and select low-emission materials. This work presents the development of ultra-sensitive electrostatic chamber (ESC) instruments designed to measure radon emanation in a recirculating gas loop, for future lower background experiments. Unlike traditional methods that separate emanation and detection steps, this system allows continuous radon transport and detection. This is made possible with a custom-built recirculation pump. A Python-based analysis framework, PyDAn, was developed to process and fit time-dependent radon decay data. Radon emanation rates are given for various materials measured with this instrument. A radon source of known activity provides an absolute calibration, enabling statistically-limited minimal detectable activities of 20 $\mu$Bq. These devices are powerful tools for screening materials in the development of low-background particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Radiation Hardness and Granularity in HV-CMOS: The RD50-MPW4 Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor developed by the former CERN-RD50-CMOS group, known as the \mpw, demonstrates competitive radiation tolerance, spatial granularity, and timing resolution -- key requirements for future high-energy physics experiments such as the HL-LHC and FCC. Fabricated using a \SI{150}{nm} CMOS process by \emph{LFoundry}, it introduces several improvements over its predecessor, the \emph{RD50-MPW3}, including separated power domains for reduced noise, a new backside biasing scheme, and an enhanced guard ring structure, enabling operation at bias voltages up to \SI{800}{V}.
  Tests with non-irradiated samples achieved hit detection efficiencies exceeding \SI{99.9}{\%} and a spatial resolution around \SI{16}{\mu m}. Neutron-irradiated sensors were characterized using IV measurements and test-beam campaigns, confirming the sensor's robustness in high-radiation environments. The results highlight the ability of HV-CMOS technology to restore hit detection efficiency post-irradiation by increasing the applied bias voltage. Details of these measurements and timing performance are presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>KOMPASS: the new cold neutron triple-axis-spectrometer specialized for polarization analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KOMPASS is a polarized triple-axis cold neutron spectrometer recently installed at the FRM II neutron source. The instrument is designed to operate exclusively with polarized neutrons and is specialized in longitudinal polarization analysis using Helmholtz coils and spherical zero-field neutron polarimetry using a Cryopad device. The advanced guide system polarizes and focuses flexibly in the scattering plane. A first, fixed parabolic focusing part contains a series of three polarizing supermirror V-cavities that produce a highly polarized beam. By exchanging straight and parabolic front-end guide sections, the resolution of the instrument can be optimized to meet experimental requirements. Large, double-focusing monochromator and analyzer units with pyrolytic graphite crystals enable efficient and adaptive energy selection, and a compact supermirror cavity analyzes the final neutron polarization. Alternatively, or in combination with this cavity, a Heusler polarization analyzer can be used. KOMPASS offers full- and half-polarized configurations with or without secondary energy analysis and provides a wide range of polarization options. Therefore, KOMPASS is well suited for various studies of static and dynamic magnetic correlations with energy transfers on the neutron energy loss side up to ~12 meV.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning methods find growing application in the reconstruction and analysis of data in high energy physics experiments. A modified convolutional autoencoder model was employed to identify and reconstruct the pulses from scintillating crystals. The model was further investigated using four xAI methods for deeper understanding of the underlying reconstruction mechanism.

      <title>Positive-tone Nanolithography of Antimony Trisulfide with Femtosecond Laser Wet-etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimony trisulfide ($Sb_{2}S_{3}$), as an emerging material for integrated photonic devices, has attracted significant attention due to its high index, low loss, and phase-changing property in the optical regime. However, conventional lithography-based fabrication methods involve complex, time-consuming, multistep processes, rendering the photonic application of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ challenging. Here, we demonstrate that positive-tone fabrication of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ nanostructures using wet-etch femtosecond laser processing, a straightforward technique for the engraving of micro- and nanoscale structures, can address major fabrication challenges. The patterning mechanism and factors influencing resolution of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ thin film structures deposited on quartz (transmissive) and gold (reflective) substrates are experimentally investigated and supported by theoretical modelling. Using this approach, the smallest linewidth fabricated is measured at 178 nm. Consequently, multiple test patterns are demonstrated showing versatile functionalities. Functional Fresnel Zone Plates (FZPs) with varying focal length are fabricated and characterized. This study provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ based integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Light exposure and temperature effects on quantum efficiency of bialkali metal photomultipier tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In astroparticle experiments, photomultiplier tubes are crucial for detecting Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged particles, owing to their exceptional sensitivity to low-intensity light, which is essential for studying high-energy phenomena associated with astrophysical neutrinos. However, due to their high sensitivity, PMTs are vulnerable to significant damage to their photocathode coating when exposed to intense light and/or high temperatures. Although this scenario is rare under controlled conditions, it can become relevant in experiments with prolonged exposure to sunlight and elevated temperatures.
  This study presents an analysis of the damage threshold and recovery time of photomultipliers with bialkali metal coatings. The investigation involved measuring the quantum efficiency of the PMTs before and after exposure to a xenon lamp for varying durations, simulating sunlight exposure over several days. Additionally, quantum efficiency was assessed before and after the PMTs were subjected to thermal stress, providing an evaluation of their performance under different thermal conditions.</description>

      <title>Primary Ionization and Particle Identification with Straw Tube Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The charged particles are tracked in the high energy physics detectors to provide the information of their properties. One of the tracking detector is straw tube detector that has been used by many experiments. The motivation behind the current work is to study the primary ionization and particle identification using straw tube detectors. Additionally, we report the decay of $^{60}$CO for the study of gamma peaks since these are used in cobalt therapy, that is beneficial for cancer/tumor treatment. The various studies like primary ionization, spatial co-ordinate distributions in the different gas mixtures, transition radiation, drift velocities of electrons and diffusion coefficients using different xenon-based gas mixtures have been obtained. These studies have been done after the optimization of xenon-based gas mixtures for a deeper understanding. The gas mixture that shows maximum transition radiation among the xenon-based gas mixtures was found to be $Xe:He:CH_{4}$ :: 30:55:15. The gas mixture that posses maximum primary ionization has been observed to be $Xe:CO_{2}$ :: 70:30. Finally, the simulations have been carried out for the particle identification in the straw tube detectors with different particles i.e., muons, pions and kaons.</description>
