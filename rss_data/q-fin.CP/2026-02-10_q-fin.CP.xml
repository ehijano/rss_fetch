      <title>The Extremity Premium: Sentiment Regimes and Adverse Selection in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index and Bitcoin daily data, we document that sentiment extremity predicts excess uncertainty beyond realized volatility. Extreme fear and extreme greed regimes exhibit significantly higher spreads than neutral periods -- a phenomenon we term the "extremity premium." Extended validation on the full Fear &amp; Greed history (February 2018--January 2026, N = 2,896) confirms the finding: within-volatility-quintile comparisons show a significant premium (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.21), Granger causality from uncertainty to spreads is strong (F = 211), and placebo tests reject the null (p &lt; 0.0001). The effect replicates on Ethereum and across 6 of 7 market cycles. However, the premium is sensitive to functional form: comprehensive regression controls absorb regime effects, while nonparametric stratification preserves them. We interpret this as evidence that sentiment extremity captures volatility-regime interactions not fully represented by parametric controls -- consistent with, but not conclusively separable from, the F&amp;G Index's embedded volatility component. An agent-based model reproduces the pattern qualitatively. The results suggest that intensity, not direction, drives uncertainty-linked liquidity withdrawal in cryptocurrency markets, though identification of "pure" sentiment effects from volatility remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Financial Bond Similarity Search Using Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding similar bonds remains challenging in fixed-income analytics, as numerical financial attributes often overshadow categorical non-financial ones such as issuer sector and domicile. This paper shows that these categorical attributes dominate the predictability of spread curves and proposes embedding models to capture their semantic similarities, outperforming one-hot and many other baselines. Evaluated via sparse-issuer augmentation, the approach improves risk modeling and curve construction.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Without Structure: Differential Market Responses to Infrastructure vs Regulatory Events in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate differential market responses to infrastructure versus regulatory events in cryptocurrency markets using event study methodology with 4-category event classification. From 50 candidate events (2019-2025), 31 meet our impact and estimation-data criteria across 4 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). We employ constant mean and market-adjusted models with event-level block bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) that properly account for cross-sectional correlation.
  Our primary comparison focuses on negative-valence events: infrastructure failures (10 events identified; 8 with sufficient estimation data for analysis) versus regulatory enforcement (7 events). We find infrastructure failures produce mean Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR) of -7.6% (bootstrap 95% CI: [-25.8%, +11.3%]) and regulatory enforcement produces mean CAR of -11.1% (CI: [-31.0%, +10.7%]). The difference in mean CARs of +3.6 percentage points (pp) has CI [-25.3%, +30.9%], p = 0.81. This is a null finding: markets respond similarly to both shock types when controlling for event valence.
  Robustness checks confirm: (1) consistent negative sign across all window specifications ([0, +1] to [-5, +30]), (2) results survive leave-one-out exclusion of FTX and Terra, (3) market model with BTC/equal-weighted (EW) proxy attenuates but does not flip results. The 4-category classification addresses prior conflation of upgrades with failures.
  Interpretation note: This exploratory analysis should be treated as hypothesis-generating; any post-hoc theoretical framing requires prospective testing with larger samples.</description>

      <title>QuantaAlpha: An Evolutionary Framework for LLM-Driven Alpha Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are noisy and non-stationary, making alpha mining highly sensitive to noise in backtesting results and sudden market regime shifts. While recent agentic frameworks improve alpha mining automation, they often lack controllable multi-round search and reliable reuse of validated experience. To address these challenges, we propose QuantaAlpha, an evolutionary alpha mining framework that treats each end-to-end mining run as a trajectory and improves factors through trajectory-level mutation and crossover operations. QuantaAlpha localizes suboptimal steps in each trajectory for targeted revision and recombines complementary high-reward segments to reuse effective patterns, enabling structured exploration and refinement across mining iterations. During factor generation, QuantaAlpha enforces semantic consistency across the hypothesis, factor expression, and executable code, while constraining the complexity and redundancy of the generated factor to mitigate crowding. Extensive experiments on the China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300) demonstrate consistent gains over strong baseline models and prior agentic systems. When utilizing GPT-5.2, QuantaAlpha achieves an Information Coefficient (IC) of 0.1501, with an Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) of 27.75% and a Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 7.98%. Moreover, factors mined on CSI 300 transfer effectively to the China Securities Index 500 (CSI 500) and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (S&amp;P 500), delivering 160% and 137% cumulative excess return over four years, respectively, which indicates strong robustness of QuantaAlpha under market distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>RealFin: How Well Do LLMs Reason About Finance When Users Leave Things Unsaid?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable financial reasoning requires knowing not only how to answer, but also when an answer cannot be justified. In real financial practice, problems often rely on implicit assumptions that are taken for granted rather than stated explicitly, causing problems to appear solvable while lacking enough information for a definite answer. We introduce REALFIN, a bilingual benchmark that evaluates financial reasoning by systematically removing essential premises from exam-style questions while keeping them linguistically plausible. Based on this, we evaluate models under three formulations that test answering, recognizing missing information, and rejecting unjustified options, and find consistent performance drops when key conditions are absent. General-purpose models tend to over-commit and guess, while most finance-specialized models fail to clearly identify missing premises. These results highlight a critical gap in current evaluations and show that reliable financial models must know when a question should not be answered.</description>

      <title>Nansde-net: A neural sde framework for generating time series with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling time series with long- or short-memory characteristics is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with It\^o calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an It\^o-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NANSDE-Net matches or outperforms existing models, including fractional SDE-Net, in reproducing long- and short-memory features of the data, while maintaining computational tractability within the It\^o calculus framework.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Execution Problems via In-Context Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel transformer-based neural network architecture (ICON-OCnet) for solving optimal order execution problems in the presence of unknown price impact. Our architecture facilitates data-driven in-context operator learning for the incurred price impact by merging offline pre-training with online few-shot prompting inference. First, the operator learning component (ICON) learns the prevailing price impact environment from only a few executed trade and price impact trajectories (time series data) provided as context. Second, we employ ICON as a surrogate operator to train a neural network policy (OCnet) for the optimal order execution strategy for the price impact regime inferred from the in-context examples. We study the efficiency of our approach for linear propagator models with path-dependent transient price impact and explicitly known optimal execution strategies. In this model class, price impact persists and decays over time according to some propagator kernel. We illustrate that ICON is capable of accurately inferring the underlying price impact model from the data prompts, even for propagator kernels not seen in the training data. Moreover, we demonstrate that ICON-OCnet correctly retrieves the exact optimal order execution strategy for the model generating the in-context examples. Our introduced methodology is very general, offering a new approach to solving path-dependent optimal stochastic control problems sample-based with unknown state dynamics.</description>
