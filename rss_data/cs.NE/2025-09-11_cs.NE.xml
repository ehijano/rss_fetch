      <title>Time-Fair Benchmarking for Metaheuristics: A Restart-Fair Protocol for Fixed-Time Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous purportedly improved metaheuristics claim superior performance based on equivalent function evaluations (FEs), yet often conceal additional computational burdens in more intensive iterations, preprocessing stages, or hyperparameter tuning. This paper posits that wall-clock time, rather than solely FEs, should serve as the principal budgetary constraint for equitable comparisons. We formalize a fixed-time, restart-fair benchmarking protocol wherein each algorithm is allotted an identical wall-clock time budget per problem instance, permitting unrestricted utilization of restarts, early termination criteria, and internal adaptive mechanisms. We advocate for the adoption of anytime performance curves, expected running time (ERT) metrics, and performance profiles that employ time as the cost measure, all aimed at predefined targets. Furthermore, we introduce a concise, reproducible checklist to standardize reporting practices and mitigate undisclosed computational overheads. This approach fosters more credible and practically relevant evaluations of metaheuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>A modified RIME algorithm with covariance learning and diversity enhancement for numerical optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The results show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic RIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed and stability.</description>

      <title>An improved educational competition optimizer with multi-covariance learning operators for global optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites, and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability, and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses, including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Convolution and Vision Transformer integrated model with Multi-scale Self-attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. \textcolor{blue}{However, its large model size and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance in downstream vision tasks, we propose an efficient ViT model with sparse attention (dubbed SAEViT) and convolution blocks. Specifically, a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module has been proposed to perform adaptive sparse sampling and recover the feature map via deconvolution operation,} which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, which mitigates the redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FFN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for fundamental vision tasks.</description>
