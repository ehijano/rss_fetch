      <title>MemWarp: Discontinuity-Preserving Cardiac Registration with Memorized Anatomical Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing learning-based deformable image registration methods impose constraints on deformation fields to ensure they are globally smooth and continuous. However, this assumption does not hold in cardiac image registration, where different anatomical regions exhibit asymmetric motions during respiration and movements due to sliding organs within the chest. Consequently, such global constraints fail to accommodate local discontinuities across organ boundaries, potentially resulting in erroneous and unrealistic displacement fields. In this paper, we address this issue with MemWarp, a learning framework that leverages a memory network to store prototypical information tailored to different anatomical regions. MemWarp is different from earlier approaches in two main aspects: firstly, by decoupling feature extraction from similarity matching in moving and fixed images, it facilitates more effective utilization of feature maps; secondly, despite its capability to preserve discontinuities, it eliminates the need for segmentation masks during model inference. In experiments on a publicly available cardiac dataset, our method achieves considerable improvements in registration accuracy and producing realistic deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable 7.1\% Dice score improvement over the runner-up semi-supervised method.

      <title>Explicit_NeRF_QA: A Quality Assessment Database for Explicit NeRF Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated significant advantages in representing and synthesizing 3D scenes. Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit_NeRF_QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics. The dataset, including NeRF samples, source 3D objects, multiview images for NeRF generation, PVSs, MOS, is made publicly available at the following location: https://github.com/LittlericeChloe/Explicit_NeRF_QA.</description>

      <title>DSCENet: Dynamic Screening and Clinical-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for MPNs Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise subtype classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) based on multimodal information, which assists clinicians in diagnosis and long-term treatment plans, is of great clinical significance. However, it remains a great challenging task due to the lack of diagnostic representativeness for local patches and the absence of diagnostic-relevant features from a single modality. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Screening and Clinical-Enhanced Network (DSCENet) for the subtype classification of MPNs on the multimodal fusion of whole slide images (WSIs) and clinical information. (1) A dynamic screening module is proposed to flexibly adapt the feature learning of local patches, reducing the interference of irrelevant features and enhancing their diagnostic representativeness. (2) A clinical-enhanced fusion module is proposed to integrate clinical indicators to explore complementary features across modalities, providing comprehensive diagnostic information. Our approach has been validated on the real clinical data, achieving an increase of 7.91% AUC and 16.89% accuracy compared with the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

      <title>Multimodal contrastive learning for spatial gene expression prediction using histology images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the advent of spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology has unlocked unprecedented opportunities for delving into the complexities of gene expression patterns within intricate biological systems. Despite its transformative potential, the prohibitive cost of ST technology remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in large-scale studies. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy involves employing artificial intelligence to predict gene expression levels using readily accessible whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&amp;E). However, existing methods have yet to fully capitalize on multimodal information provided by H&amp;E images and ST data with spatial location. In this paper, we propose \textbf{mclSTExp}, a multimodal contrastive learning with Transformer and Densenet-121 encoder for Spatial Transcriptomics Expression prediction. We conceptualize each spot as a "word", integrating its intrinsic features with spatial context through the self-attention mechanism of a Transformer encoder. This integration is further enriched by incorporating image features via contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the predictive capability of our model. Our extensive evaluation of \textbf{mclSTExp} on two breast cancer datasets and a skin squamous cell carcinoma dataset demonstrates its superior performance in predicting spatial gene expression. Moreover, mclSTExp has shown promise in interpreting cancer-specific overexpressed genes, elucidating immune-related genes, and identifying specialized spatial domains annotated by pathologists.

      <title>Spatially-Variant Degradation Model for Dataset-free Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the dataset-free Blind Image Super-Resolution (BISR). Unlike existing dataset-free BISR methods that focus on obtaining a degradation kernel for the entire image, we are the first to explicitly design a spatially-variant degradation model for each pixel. Our method also benefits from having a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to data-driven spatially-variant BISR methods. Concretely, each pixel's degradation kernel is expressed as a linear combination of a learnable dictionary composed of a small number of spatially-variant atom kernels. The coefficient matrices of the atom degradation kernels are derived using membership functions of fuzzy set theory. We construct a novel Probabilistic BISR model with tailored likelihood function and prior terms. Subsequently, we employ the Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer the degradation kernels for each pixel. Our method achieves a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art BISR methods, with an average improvement of 1 dB (2x).Code will be released at https://github.com/shaojieguoECNU/SVDSR.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compressed Sensing with Diffusion-Based Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed Sensing (CS) facilitates rapid image acquisition by selecting a small subset of measurements sufficient for high-fidelity reconstruction. Adaptive CS seeks to further enhance this process by dynamically choosing future measurements based on information gleaned from data that is already acquired. However, many existing frameworks are often tailored to specific tasks and require intricate training procedures. We propose AdaSense, a novel Adaptive CS approach that leverages zero-shot posterior sampling with pre-trained diffusion models. By sequentially sampling from the posterior distribution, we can quantify the uncertainty of each possible future linear measurement throughout the acquisition process. AdaSense eliminates the need for additional training and boasts seamless adaptation to diverse domains with minimal tuning requirements. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSense in reconstructing facial images from a small number of measurements. Furthermore, we apply AdaSense for active acquisition of medical images in the domains of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), highlighting its potential for tangible real-world acceleration.</description>

      <title>GUI-based Pedicle Screw Planning on Fluoroscopic Images Utilizing Vertebral Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed work establishes a novel Graphical User Interface (GUI) framework, primarily designed for intraoperative pedicle screw planning. Current planning workflow in Image Guided Surgeries primarily relies on pre-operative CT planning. Intraoperative CT planning can be time-consuming and expensive and thus is not a common practice. In situations where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are paramount, planning to utilize fluoroscopic images acquired for image registration emerges as the optimal choice. The methodology proposed in this study employs a simulated 3D pedicle screw to calculate its coronal and sagittal projections for pedicle screw planning using anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LP) images. The initialization and placement of pedicle screw is computed by utilizing the bounding box of vertebral segmentation, which is obtained by the application of enhanced YOLOv5. The GUI front end includes functionality that allows surgeons or medical practitioners to efficiently choose, set up, and dynamically maneuver the pedicle screw on AP and LP images. This is based on a novel feature called synchronous planning, which involves correlating pedicle screws from the coronal and sagittal planes. This correlation utilizes projective correspondence to ensure that any movement of the pedicle screw in either the AP or LP image will be reflected in the other image. The proposed GUI framework is a time-efficient and cost-effective tool for synchronizing and planning the movement of pedicle screws during intraoperative surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>Ethics of Generating Synthetic MRI Vocal Tract Views from the Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forming oral models capable of understanding the complete dynamics of the oral cavity is vital across research areas such as speech correction, designing foods for the aging population, and dentistry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, capable of capturing oral data essential for creating such detailed representations, offer a powerful tool for illustrating articulatory dynamics. However, its real-time application is hindered by expense and expertise requirements. Ever advancing generative AI approaches present themselves as a way to address this barrier by leveraging multi-modal approaches for generating pseudo-MRI views. Nonetheless, this immediately sparks ethical concerns regarding the utilisation of a technology with the capability to produce MRIs from facial observations.
  This paper explores the ethical implications of external-to-internal correlation modeling (E2ICM). E2ICM utilises facial movements to infer internal configurations and provides a cost-effective supporting technology for MRI. In this preliminary work, we employ Pix2PixGAN to generate pseudo-MRI views from external articulatory data, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Ethical considerations concerning privacy, consent, and potential misuse, which are fundamental to our examination of this innovative methodology, are discussed as a result of this experimentation.</description>

      <title>Global Spatial-Temporal Information-based Residual ConvLSTM for Video Space-Time Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By converting low-frame-rate, low-resolution videos into high-frame-rate, high-resolution ones, space-time video super-resolution techniques can enhance visual experiences and facilitate more efficient information dissemination. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for space-time video super-resolution, namely GIRNet. To generate highly accurate features and thus improve performance, the proposed network integrates a feature-level temporal interpolation module with deformable convolutions and a global spatial-temporal information-based residual convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) module. In the feature-level temporal interpolation module, we leverage deformable convolution, which adapts to deformations and scale variations of objects across different scene locations. This presents a more efficient solution than conventional convolution for extracting features from moving objects. Our network effectively uses forward and backward feature information to determine inter-frame offsets, leading to the direct generation of interpolated frame features. In the global spatial-temporal information-based residual convLSTM module, the first convLSTM is used to derive global spatial-temporal information from the input features, and the second convLSTM uses the previously computed global spatial-temporal information feature as its initial cell state. This second convLSTM adopts residual connections to preserve spatial information, thereby enhancing the output features. Experiments on the Vimeo90K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in peak signal-to-noise-ratio (by 1.45 dB, 1.14 dB, and 0.02 dB over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), structural similarity index(by 0.027, 0.023, and 0.006 over STARnet, TMNet, and 3DAttGAN, respectively), and visually.</description>

      <title>SliceMamba for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the progress made in Mamba-based medical image segmentation models, current methods utilizing unidirectional or multi-directional feature scanning mechanisms fail to well model dependencies between neighboring positions in the image, hindering the effective modeling of local features. However, local features are crucial for medical image segmentation as they provide vital information about lesions and tissue structures. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet effective method named SliceMamba, a locally sensitive pure Mamba medical image segmentation model. The proposed SliceMamba includes an efffcient Bidirectional Slice Scan module (BSS), which performs bidirectional feature segmentation while employing varied scanning mechanisms for distinct features. This ensures that spatially adjacent features maintain proximity in the scanning sequence, thereby enhancing segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>DIOR-ViT: Differential Ordinal Learning Vision Transformer for Cancer Classification in Pathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational pathology, cancer grading has been mainly studied as a categorical classification problem, which does not utilize the ordering nature of cancer grades such as the higher the grade is, the worse the cancer is. To incorporate the ordering relationship among cancer grades, we introduce a differential ordinal learning problem in which we define and learn the degree of difference in the categorical class labels between pairs of samples by using their differences in the feature space. To this end, we propose a transformer-based neural network that simultaneously conducts both categorical classification and differential ordinal classification for cancer grading. We also propose a tailored loss function for differential ordinal learning. Evaluating the proposed method on three different types of cancer datasets, we demonstrate that the adoption of differential ordinal learning can improve the accuracy and reliability of cancer grading, outperforming conventional cancer grading approaches. The proposed approach should be applicable to other diseases and problems as they involve ordinal relationship among class labels.</description>

      <title>Haar Nuclear Norms with Applications to Remote Sensing Imagery Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration.
  It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing context models for point cloud geometry compression with context feature residuals and multi-loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In point cloud geometry compression, context models usually use the one-hot encoding of node occupancy as the label, and the cross-entropy between the one-hot encoding and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss function. However, this approach has two main weaknesses. First, the differences between contexts of different nodes are not significant, making it difficult for the context model to accurately predict the probability distribution of node occupancy. Second, as the one-hot encoding is not the actual probability distribution of node occupancy, the cross-entropy loss function is inaccurate. To address these problems, we propose a general structure that can enhance existing context models. We introduce the context feature residuals into the context model to amplify the differences between contexts. We also add a multi-layer perception branch, that uses the mean squared error between its output and node occupancy as a loss function to provide accurate gradients in backpropagation. We validate our method by showing that it can improve the performance of an octree-based model (OctAttention) and a voxel-based model (VoxelDNN) on the object point cloud datasets MPEG 8i and MVUB, as well as the LiDAR point cloud dataset SemanticKITTI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing octree-based context models for point cloud geometry compression with attention-based child node number prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In point cloud geometry compression, most octreebased context models use the cross-entropy between the onehot encoding of node occupancy and the probability distribution predicted by the context model as the loss. This approach converts the problem of predicting the number (a regression problem) and the position (a classification problem) of occupied child nodes into a 255-dimensional classification problem. As a result, it fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. We first analyze why the cross-entropy loss function fails to accurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability distribution. Then, we propose an attention-based child node number prediction (ACNP) module to enhance the context models. The proposed module can predict the number of occupied child nodes and map it into an 8- dimensional vector to assist the context model in predicting the probability distribution of the occupancy of the current node for efficient entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module enhances the coding efficiency of octree-based context models.</description>

Abstract: Screen content (SC) differs from natural scene (NS) with unique characteristics such as noise-free, repetitive patterns, and high contrast. Aiming at addressing the inadequacies of current learned image compression (LIC) methods for SC, we propose an improved two-stage octave convolutional residual blocks (IToRB) for high and low-frequency feature extraction and a cascaded two-stage multi-scale residual blocks (CTMSRB) for improved multi-scale learning and nonlinearity in SC. Additionally, we employ a window-based attention module (WAM) to capture pixel correlations, especially for high contrast regions in the image. We also construct a diverse SC image compression dataset (SDU-SCICD2K) for training, including text, charts, graphics, animation, movie, game and mixture of SC images and NS images. Experimental results show our method, more suited for SC than NS data, outperforms existing LIC methods in rate-distortion performance on SC images.

      <title>SLoRD: Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for Shape Consistency in Vertebrae Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic and precise segmentation of vertebrae from CT images is crucial for various clinical applications. However, due to a lack of explicit and strict constraints, existing methods especially for single-stage methods, still suffer from the challenge of intra-vertebrae segmentation inconsistency, which refers to multiple label predictions inside a singular vertebra. For multi-stage methods, vertebrae detection serving as the first step, is affected by the pathology and mental implants. Thus, incorrect detections cause biased patches before segmentation, then lead to inconsistent labeling and segmentation. In our work, motivated by the perspective of instance segmentation, we try to label individual and complete binary masks to address this limitation. Specifically, a contour-based network is proposed based on Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for shape consistency, termed SLoRD. These contour descriptors are acquired in a data-driven manner in advance. For a more precise representation of contour descriptors, we adopt the spherical coordinate system and devise the spherical centroid. Besides, the contour loss is designed to impose explicit consistency constraints, facilitating regressed contour points close to vertebral boundaries. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on VerSe 2019 demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over other single-stage and multi-stage state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>BiasPruner: Debiased Continual Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is crucial for enabling networks to dynamically adapt as they learn new tasks sequentially, accommodating new data and classes without catastrophic forgetting. Diverging from conventional perspectives on CL, our paper introduces a new perspective wherein forgetting could actually benefit the sequential learning paradigm. Specifically, we present BiasPruner, a CL framework that intentionally forgets spurious correlations in the training data that could lead to shortcut learning. Utilizing a new bias score that measures the contribution of each unit in the network to learning spurious features, BiasPruner prunes those units with the highest bias scores to form a debiased subnetwork preserved for a given task. As BiasPruner learns a new task, it constructs a new debiased subnetwork, potentially incorporating units from previous subnetworks, which improves adaptation and performance on the new task. During inference, BiasPruner employs a simple task-agnostic approach to select the best debiased subnetwork for predictions. We conduct experiments on three medical datasets for skin lesion classification and chest X-Ray classification and demonstrate that BiasPruner consistently outperforms SOTA CL methods in terms of classification performance and fairness. Our code is available here.</description>

      <title>Histopathological Image Classification with Cell Morphology Aware Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathological images are widely used for the analysis of diseased (tumor) tissues and patient treatment selection. While the majority of microscopy image processing was previously done manually by pathologists, recent advances in computer vision allow for accurate recognition of lesion regions with deep learning-based solutions. Such models, however, usually require extensive annotated datasets for training, which is often not the case in the considered task, where the number of available patient data samples is very limited. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel DeepCMorph model pre-trained to learn cell morphology and identify a large number of different cancer types. The model consists of two modules: the first one performs cell nuclei segmentation and annotates each cell type, and is trained on a combination of 8 publicly available datasets to ensure its high generalizability and robustness. The second module combines the obtained segmentation map with the original microscopy image and is trained for the downstream task. We pre-trained this module on the Pan-Cancer TCGA dataset consisting of over 270K tissue patches extracted from 8736 diagnostic slides from 7175 patients. The proposed solution achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the dataset under consideration, detecting 32 cancer types with over 82% accuracy and outperforming all previously proposed solutions by more than 4%. We demonstrate that the resulting pre-trained model can be easily fine-tuned on smaller microscopy datasets, yielding superior results compared to the current top solutions and models initialized with ImageNet weights. The codes and pre-trained models presented in this paper are available at: https://github.com/aiff22/DeepCMorph</description>

      <title>SPOCKMIP: Segmentation of Vessels in MRAs with Enhanced Continuity using Maximum Intensity Projection as Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of vessel structures of different sizes in biomedical images is crucial in the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the sparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel segmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment vessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations and the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised patch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one to two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation quality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the Maximum Intensity Projection~(MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the single~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed MIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which is evident in visual examinations of ROIs. Patch-based training is improved by introducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted discontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the StudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight~(ToF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. The generalisation performance of the method is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is observed that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better quality segmentations with a median Dice of $80.245 \pm 0.129$. Also, the method with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of $79.749 \pm 0.109$. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the predicted segmentation reveals a significant improvement in the continuity of the vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.</description>

      <title>PowerYOLO: Mixed Precision Model for Hardware Efficient Object Detection with Event Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of object detection systems in automotive solutions must be as high as possible, with minimal response time and, due to the often battery-powered operation, low energy consumption. When designing such solutions, we therefore face challenges typical for embedded vision systems: the problem of fitting algorithms of high memory and computational complexity into small low-power devices. In this paper we propose PowerYOLO - a mixed precision solution, which targets three essential elements of such application. First, we propose a system based on a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), a novel sensor, that offers low power requirements and operates well in conditions with variable illumination. It is these features that may make event cameras a preferential choice over frame cameras in some applications. Second, to ensure high accuracy and low memory and computational complexity, we propose to use 4-bit width Powers-of-Two (PoT) quantisation for convolution weights of the YOLO detector, with all other parameters quantised linearly. Finally, we embrace from PoT scheme and replace multiplication with bit-shifting to increase the efficiency of hardware acceleration of such solution, with a special convolution-batch normalisation fusion scheme. The use of specific sensor with PoT quantisation and special batch normalisation fusion leads to a unique system with almost 8x reduction in memory complexity and vast computational simplifications, with relation to a standard approach. This efficient system achieves high accuracy of mAP 0.301 on the GEN1 DVS dataset, marking the new state-of-the-art for such compressed model.</description>

      <title>ERD: Exponential Retinex decomposition based on weak space and hybrid nonconvex regularization and its denoising application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Retinex theory models the image as a product of illumination and reflection components, which has received extensive attention and is widely used in image enhancement, segmentation and color restoration. However, it has been rarely used in additive noise removal due to the inclusion of both multiplication and addition operations in the Retinex noisy image modeling. In this paper, we propose an exponential Retinex decomposition model based on hybrid non-convex regularization and weak space oscillation-modeling for image denoising. The proposed model utilizes non-convex first-order total variation (TV) and non-convex second-order TV to regularize the reflection component and the illumination component, respectively, and employs weak $H^{-1}$ norm to measure the residual component. By utilizing different regularizers, the proposed model effectively decomposes the image into reflection, illumination, and noise components. An alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM) combined with the Majorize-Minimization (MM) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Furthermore, we provide a detailed proof of the convergence property of the algorithm. Numerical experiments validate both the proposed model and algorithm. Compared with several state-of-the-art denoising models, the proposed model exhibits superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for generating 3D microstructures from a single two-dimensional (2D) image, capable of producing high-quality, realistic 3D images at low cost. In the method, a framework (CEM3DMG) is designed to synthesize 3D images by learning microstructural information from a 2D backscattered electron (BSE) image. Experimental results show that CEM3DMG can generate realistic 3D images of arbitrary size with a resolution of 0.47 $\mu m$ per pixel. Visual observation confirms that the generated 3D images exhibit similar microstructural features to the 2D images, including pores and particles morphology. Furthermore, quantitative analysis reveals that these 3D microstructures closely match the real 2D microstructure in terms of gray level histogram, phase proportions, and pore size distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET-MRI) systems can obtain functional and anatomical scans. PET suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the k-space data acquisition process in MRI is time-consuming. The study aims to accelerate MRI and enhance PET image quality. Conventional approaches involve the separate reconstruction of each modality within PET-MRI systems. However, there exists complementary information among multi-modal images. The complementary information can contribute to image reconstruction. In this study, we propose a novel PET-MRI joint reconstruction model employing a mutual consistency-driven diffusion mode, namely MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion learns the joint probability distribution of PET and MRI for utilizing complementary information. We conducted a series of contrast experiments about LPLS, Joint ISAT-net and MC-Diffusion by the ADNI dataset. The results underscore the qualitative and quantitative improvements achieved by MC-Diffusion, surpassing the state-of-the-art method.</description>

Abstract: In the field of medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, the reliability of these models is heavily dependent on the quality of training data, and the existence of label noise (errors in dataset annotations) of medical image data presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a new sample selection method that enhances the performance of neural networks when trained on noisy datasets. Our approach features estimating the noise rate of a dataset by analyzing the distribution of loss values using Linear Regression. Samples are then ranked according to their loss values, and potentially noisy samples are excluded from the dataset. Additionally, we employ sparse regularization to further enhance the noise robustness of our model. Our proposed method is evaluated on five benchmark datasets and a real-life noisy medical image dataset. Notably, two of these datasets contain 3D medical images. The results of our experiments show that our method outperforms existing noise-robust learning methods, particularly in scenarios with high noise rates. Key words: noise-robust learning, medical image analysis, noise rate estimation, sample selection, sparse regularization</description>

Abstract: In this study, we aim to build up a model that can Segment Anything in radiology scans, driven by Text prompts, termed as SAT. Our main contributions are three folds: (i) for dataset construction, we construct the first multi-modal knowledge tree on human anatomy, including 6502 anatomical terminologies; Then we build up the largest and most comprehensive segmentation dataset for training, by collecting over 22K 3D medical image scans from 72 segmentation datasets, across 497 classes, with careful standardization on both image scans and label space; (ii) for architecture design, we propose to inject medical knowledge into a text encoder via contrastive learning, and then formulate a universal segmentation model, that can be prompted by feeding in medical terminologies in text form; (iii) As a result, we have trained SAT-Nano (110M parameters) and SAT-Pro (447M parameters), demonstrating comparable performance to 72 specialist nnU-Nets trained on each dataset/subsets. We validate SAT as a foundational segmentation model, with better generalization ability on external (unseen) datasets, and can be further improved on specific tasks after fine-tuning adaptation. Comparing with interactive segmentation model, for example, MedSAM, segmentation model prompted by text enables superior performance, scalability and robustness. As a use case, we demonstrate that SAT can act as a powerful out-of-the-box agent for large language models, enabling visual grounding in clinical procedures such as report generation. All the data, codes, and models in this work have been released.</description>

      <title>Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction of Freehand 3D Ultrasound Volume with Geometric Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound (US) is a widely used imaging modality that allows non-invasive imaging of medical anatomy without radiation exposure. Surface reconstruction of US volume is vital to acquire the accurate anatomical structures needed for modeling, registration, and visualization. However, traditional methods cannot produce a high-quality surface due to image noise. Despite improvements in smoothness, continuity, and resolution from deep learning approaches, research on surface reconstruction in freehand 3D US is still limited. This study introduces FUNSR, a self-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction method to learn signed distance functions (SDFs) from US volumes. In particular, FUNSR iteratively learns the SDFs by moving the 3D queries sampled around volumetric point clouds to approximate the surface, guided by two novel geometric constraints: sign consistency constraint and onsurface constraint with adversarial learning. Our approach has been thoroughly evaluated across four datasets to demonstrate its adaptability to various anatomical structures, including a hip phantom dataset, two vascular datasets and one publicly available prostate dataset. We also show that smooth and continuous representations greatly enhance the visual appearance of US data. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of our method to improve segmentation performance, and its robustness to noise distribution and motion perturbation.</description>

      <title>Towards Arbitrary-Scale Histopathology Image Super-resolution: An Efficient Dual-branch Framework via Implicit Self-texture Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15613v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality whole-slide scanners are expensive, complex, and time-consuming, thus limiting the acquisition and utilization of high-resolution pathology whole-slide images in daily clinical work. Deep learning-based single-image super-resolution techniques are an effective way to solve this problem by synthesizing high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. However, the existing super-resolution models applied in pathology images can only work in fixed integer magnifications, significantly decreasing their applicability. Though methods based on implicit neural representation have shown promising results in arbitrary-scale super-resolution of natural images, applying them directly to pathology images is inadequate because they have unique fine-grained image textures different from natural images. Thus, we propose an Implicit Self-Texture Enhancement-based dual-branch framework (ISTE) for arbitrary-scale super-resolution of pathology images to address this challenge. ISTE contains a pixel learning branch and a texture learning branch, which first learn pixel features and texture features, respectively. Then, we design a two-stage texture enhancement strategy to fuse the features from the two branches to obtain the super-resolution results, where the first stage is feature-based texture enhancement, and the second stage is spatial-domain-based texture enhancement. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that ISTE outperforms existing fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale algorithms at multiple magnifications and helps to improve downstream task performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve arbitrary-scale super-resolution in pathology images. Codes will be available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human vision relies heavily on available ambient light to perceive objects. Low-light scenes pose two distinct challenges: information loss due to insufficient illumination and undesirable brightness shifts. Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) refers to image enhancement technology tailored to handle this scenario. We introduce CPGA-Net, an innovative LLIE network that combines dark/bright channel priors and gamma correction via deep learning and integrates features inspired by the Atmospheric Scattering Model and the Retinex Theory. This approach combines the use of traditional and deep learning methodologies, designed within a simple yet efficient architectural framework that focuses on essential feature extraction. The resulting CPGA-Net is a lightweight network with only 0.025 million parameters and 0.030 seconds for inference time, yet it achieves superior performance over existing LLIE methods on both objective and subjective evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we utilized knowledge distillation with explainable factors and proposed an efficient version that achieves 0.018 million parameters and 0.006 seconds for inference time. The proposed approaches inject new solution ideas into LLIE, providing practical applications in challenging low-light scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mask-Enhanced Segment Anything Model for Tumor Lesion Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Tumor lesion segmentation on CT or MRI images plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Considering the inherent differences in tumor lesion segmentation data across various medical imaging modalities and equipment, integrating medical knowledge into the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents promising capability due to its versatility and generalization potential. Recent studies have attempted to enhance SAM with medical expertise by pre-training on large-scale medical segmentation datasets. However, challenges still exist in 3D tumor lesion segmentation owing to tumor complexity and the imbalance in foreground and background regions. Therefore, we introduce Mask-Enhanced SAM (M-SAM), an innovative architecture tailored for 3D tumor lesion segmentation. We propose a novel Mask-Enhanced Adapter (MEA) within M-SAM that enriches the semantic information of medical images with positional data from coarse segmentation masks, facilitating the generation of more precise segmentation masks. Furthermore, an iterative refinement scheme is implemented in M-SAM to refine the segmentation masks progressively, leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments on seven tumor lesion segmentation datasets indicate that our M-SAM not only achieves high segmentation accuracy but also exhibits robust generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/nanase1025/M-SAM.</description>

      <title>Advancing Medical Image Segmentation with Mini-Net: A Lightweight Solution Tailored for Efficient Segmentation of Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures and abnormalities in medical images is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and analysis. While deep learning techniques excel at this task, their computational demands pose challenges. Additionally, some cutting-edge segmentation methods, though effective for general object segmentation, may not be optimised for medical images. To address these issues, we propose Mini-Net, a lightweight segmentation network specifically designed for medical images. With fewer than 38,000 parameters, Mini-Net efficiently captures both high- and low-frequency features, enabling real-time applications in various medical imaging scenarios. We evaluate Mini-Net on various datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, ISIC-2016, ISIC-2018, and MoNuSeg, demonstrating its robustness and good performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Clinical Benchmark of Public Self-Supervised Pathology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) to train pathology foundation models has increased substantially in the past few years. Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Improved Calibrationless Radial MRI with NLINV-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a neural network architecture for improved calibrationless reconstruction of radial data when no ground truth is available for training. Methods: NLINV-Net is a model-based neural network architecture that directly estimates images and coil sensitivities from (radial) k-space data via non-linear inversion (NLINV). Combined with a training strategy using self-supervision via data undersampling (SSDU), it can be used for imaging problems where no ground truth reconstructions are available. We validated the method for (1) real-time cardiac imaging and (2) single-shot subspace-based quantitative T1 mapping. Furthermore, region-optimized virtual (ROVir) coils were used to suppress artifacts stemming from outside the FoV and to focus the k-space based SSDU loss on the region of interest. NLINV-Net based reconstructions were compared with conventional NLINV and PI-CS (parallel imaging + compressed sensing) reconstruction and the effect of the region-optimized virtual coils and the type of training loss was evaluated qualitatively. Results: NLINV-Net based reconstructions contain significantly less noise than the NLINV-based counterpart. ROVir coils effectively suppress streakings which are not suppressed by the neural networks while the ROVir-based focussed loss leads to visually sharper time series for the movement of the myocardial wall in cardiac real-time imaging. For quantitative imaging, T1-maps reconstructed using NLINV-Net show similar quality as PI-CS reconstructions, but NLINV-Net does not require slice-specific tuning of the regularization parameter. Conclusion: NLINV-Net is a versatile tool for calibrationless imaging which can be used in challenging imaging scenarios where a ground truth is not available.</description>

      <title>Domain wall and Magnetic Tunnel Junction Hybrid for on-chip Learning in UNet architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present spintronic devices based hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, rectified activation function (ReLU), and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We designed the convolution and deconvolution layers of the network using the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ. We also construct the ReLU and max pooling functions of the network utilizing the spin hall driven orthogonal current injected MTJ. To incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our UNet design, we employ a hybrid simulation setup that couples micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, SPICE simulation along with network implementation. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies of 83.71$\%$ on test data, on par with the software implementation with 821mJ of energy consumption for on-chip training over 150 epochs. We further demonstrate nearly one order $(10\times)$ improvement in the energy requirement of the network using unstable ferromagnet ($\Delta$=4.58) over the stable ferromagnet ($\Delta$=45) based ReLU and max pooling functions while maintaining the similar accuracy. The hybrid architecture comprising domain wall MTJ and unstable FM-based MTJ leads to an on-chip energy consumption of 85.79mJ during training, with a testing energy cost of 1.55 $\mu J$.</description>

      <title>BANF: Band-limited Neural Fields for Levels of Detail Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Largely due to their implicit nature, neural fields lack a direct mechanism for filtering, as Fourier analysis from discrete signal processing is not directly applicable to these representations. Effective filtering of neural fields is critical to enable level-of-detail processing in downstream applications, and support operations that involve sampling the field on regular grids (e.g. marching cubes). Existing methods that attempt to decompose neural fields in the frequency domain either resort to heuristics or require extensive modifications to the neural field architecture. We show that via a simple modification, one can obtain neural fields that are low-pass filtered, and in turn show how this can be exploited to obtain a frequency decomposition of the entire signal. We demonstrate the validity of our technique by investigating level-of-detail reconstruction, and showing how coarser representations can be computed effectively.</description>

      <title>Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new task called Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR), aimed at identifying atomic actions of a particular person based on a textual description and the video data of this person. This task differs from traditional action recognition and localization, where predictions are delivered for all present individuals. In contrast, we focus on recognizing the correct atomic action of a specific individual, guided by text. To explore this task, we present the RefAVA dataset, containing 36,630 instances with manually annotated textual descriptions of the individuals. To establish a strong initial benchmark, we implement and validate baselines from various domains, e.g., atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval. Since these existing methods underperform on RAVAR, we introduce RefAtomNet -- a novel cross-stream attention-driven method specialized for the unique challenges of RAVAR: the need to interpret a textual referring expression for the targeted individual, utilize this reference to guide the spatial localization and harvest the prediction of the atomic actions for the referring person. The key ingredients are: (1) a multi-stream architecture that connects video, text, and a new location-semantic stream, and (2) cross-stream agent attention fusion and agent token fusion which amplify the most relevant information across these streams and consistently surpasses standard attention-based fusion on RAVAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RefAtomNet and its building blocks for recognizing the action of the described individual. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/RAVAR.</description>

      <title>Functional Assessment of Cerebral Capillaries using Single Capillary Reporters in Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain's microvascular cerebral capillary network plays a vital role in maintaining neuronal health, yet capillary dynamics are still not well understood due to limitations in existing imaging techniques. Here, we present Single Capillary Reporters (SCaRe) for transcranial Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM), a novel approach enabling non-invasive, whole-brain mapping of single capillaries and estimates of their transit-time as a neurovascular biomarker. We accomplish this first through computational Monte Carlo and ultrasound simulations of microbubbles flowing through a fully-connected capillary network. We unveil distinct capillary flow behaviors which informs methodological changes to ULM acquisitions to better capture capillaries in vivo. Subsequently, applying SCaRe-ULM in vivo, we achieve unprecedented visualization of single capillary tracks across brain regions, analysis of layer-specific capillary heterogeneous transit times (CHT), and characterization of whole microbubble trajectories from arterioles to venules. Lastly, we evaluate capillary biomarkers using injected lipopolysaccharide to induce systemic neuroinflammation and track the increase in SCaRe-ULM CHT, demonstrating the capability to detect subtle capillary functional changes. SCaRe-ULM represents a significant advance in studying microvascular dynamics, offering novel avenues for investigating capillary patterns in neurological disorders and potential diagnostic applications.</description>
