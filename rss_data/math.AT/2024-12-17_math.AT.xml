      <title>Machine Proofs for Adams Differentials and Extension Problems among CW Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document, we describe the process of obtaining numerous Adams differentials and extensions using computational methods, as well as how to interpret the dataset uploaded to Zenodo. Detailed proofs of the machine-generated results are also provided. The dataset includes information on 210 CW spectra, 624 maps, and 98 cofiber sequences. Leveraging these results, and with the addition of some ad hoc arguments derived through human insight, we successfully resolved the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem in dimension 126.</description>

      <title>On the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence. As a result, we establish the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem.
  Combining this result with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, we conclude that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions $2, 6, 14, 30, 62$, and $126$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Without Open Sets: A Net Approach to Homotopy Theory in Limit Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence spaces are a generalization of topological spaces. The category of convergence spaces is well-suited for Algebraic Topology, one of the reasons is the existence of exponential objects provided by continuous convergence. In this work, we use a net-theoretic approach to convergence spaces. The goal is to simplify the description of continuous convergence and apply it to problems related to homotopy theory. We present methods to develop the basis of homotopy theory in limit spaces, define the fundamental groupoid, and prove the groupoid version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for limit spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the classical results of Stong, we introduce a cohomological analogue of a core of a finite sheaved topological space and propose an algorithm for simplification in this category. In particular we generalize the notion of beat vertices and show that if a vertex of a sheaved space has topologically acyclic downset (with trivial coefficients), then its removal preserves the sheaf cohomology.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Persistence Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method to apply and visualize persistent homology of time series is proposed. The method captures persistent features in space and time, in contrast to the existing procedures, where one usually chooses one while keeping the other fixed. An extended zigzag module that is built from a time series is defined. This module combines ideas from zigzag persistent homology and multiparameter persistent homology. Persistence landscapes are defined for the case of extended zigzag modules using a recent generalization of the rank invariant (Kim, M\'emoli, 2021). This new invariant is called spatiotemporal persistence landscapes. Under certain finiteness assumptions, spatiotemporal persistence landscapes are a family of functions that take values in Lebesgue spaces, endowing the space of persistence landscapes with a distance. Stability of this invariant is shown with respect to an adapted interleaving distance for extended zigzag modules. Being an invariant that takes values in a Banach space, spatiotemporal persistence landscapes can be used for statistical analysis as well as for input to machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Digital $n-$Manifolds With Or Without Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to define the concept of manifold, which has a very important place in the topology, on digital images. So, a general perspective is provided for two and three-dimensional imaging studies on digital curves and digital surfaces. Throughout the study, the features present in topological manifolds but that are not satisfied in the discrete version are specifically underlined. In addition, other concepts closely related to manifolds such as submanifold, orientation, and partition of unity are also discussed in digital images.</description>

      <title>The geometry of simplicial distributions on suspension scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements often exhibit non-classical features, such as contextuality, which generalizes Bell's non-locality and serves as a resource in various quantum computation models. Existing frameworks have rigorously captured these phenomena, and recently, simplicial distributions have been introduced to deepen this understanding. The geometrical structure of simplicial distributions can be seen as a resource for applications in quantum information theory. In this work, we use topological foundations to study this geometrical structure, leveraging the fact that, in this simplicial framework, measurements and outcomes are represented as spaces. This allows us to depict contextuality as a topological phenomenon. We show that applying the cone construction to the measurement space makes the corresponding non-signaling polytope equal to the join of $m$ copies of the original polytope, where $m$ is the number of possible outcomes per measurement. Then we glue two copies of cone measurement spaces to obtain a suspension measurement space. The decomposition done for simplicial distributions on a cone measurement space provides deeper insights into the geometry of simplicial distributions on a suspension measurement space and aids in characterizing the contextuality there. Additionally, we apply these results to derive a new type of Bell inequalities (inequalities that determine the set of local joint probabilities/non-contextual simplicial distributions) and to offer a mathematical explanation for certain contextual vertices from the literature.</description>

      <title>A unifying view toward polyhedral products through panel structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.04281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A panel structure on a topological space is just a locally finite family of closed subspaces. A space together with a panel structure is called a space with faces. In this paper, we introduce a notion of polyhedral product over a space with faces. This notion provides a unifying viewpoint on the constructions of polyhedral products and generalized moment-angle complexes in various settings. We compute the stable decomposition of these spaces and use it to study their cohomology ring structures. Moreover, we can compute the equivariant cohomology ring of the moment-angle complex over a space with faces with respect to the canonical torus action. The calculation leads to the notion of topological face ring of a space with faces, which generalizes the classical notion of face ring (Stanley-Reisner ring) of a simplicial complex. We will see that many known results in the study of polyhedral products and moment-angle complexes can be reinterpreted from our general theorems on the polyhedral product over a space with faces. Moreover, we can derive some new results via our approach in some settings.</description>

      <title>Stable homology of Lie algebras of derivations and homotopy invariants of wheeled operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18594v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a theorem that computes, for any augmented operad $\mathcal{O}$, the stable homology of the Lie algebra of derivations of the free algebra $\mathcal{O}(V)$ with twisted bivariant coefficients (here stabilization occurs as $\dim(V)\to\infty$) out of the homology of the wheeled bar construction of $\mathcal{O}$; this can further be used to prove uniform mixed representation stability for the homology of the positive part of that Lie algebra with constant coefficients. This result generalizes both the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan theorem on the homology of the Lie algebra of infinite matrices and the Fuchs stability theorem for the homology of the Lie algebra of vector fields. We also prove analogous theorems for the Lie algebras of derivations with constant and zero divergence, in which case one has to consider the wheeled bar construction of the wheeled completion of $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly to how cyclic homology of an algebra $A$ may be viewed as an additive version of the algebraic $K$-theory of $A$, our results hint at the additive $K$-theoretic nature of the wheeled bar construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the theory of constrained motion spaces of robotic arms. We compute their homology groups in two cases: when the constraint is a horizontal line and when it is a smooth curve whose motion space is a smooth manifold. We show the computation of homology amounts to counting the collinear configurations, reducing a topological problem to a combinatorial problem. Our results rely on Morse theory, along with Walker's and Farber's work on polygonal linkages.</description>

      <title>New Aspects of Analyzing Amyloid Fibrils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a summary of mathematical tools we used in research of analyzing the structure of proteins with amyloid form \cite{xi2024Top}. We defined several geometry indicators on the discrete curve namely the hop distance, the discrete curvature and the discrete torsion. Then, we used these indicators to analyze the structure of amyloid fibrils by regarding its peptide chains as discrete curves in $\Rds^3$. We gave examples to show that these indicators give novel insights in the characterization analysis of the structure of amyloid fibrils, for example the discrete torsion can detect the hydrogen bonds interactions between layers of amyloid fibril. {Moreover,} the topological tool performs better than the root mean square deviation (RMSD) in quantifying the difference of the structure of amyloid fibrils, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03730v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a basic class of algebras which we call homotopy path algebras. We find that such algebras always admit a cellular resolution and detail the intimate relationship between these algebras, stratifications of topological spaces, and entrance/exit paths. As examples, we prove versions of homological mirror symmetry due to Bondal-Ruan for toric varieties and due to Berglund-H\"ubsch-Krawitz for hypersurfaces with maximal symmetry. We also demonstrate that a form of shellability implies Koszulity and the existence of a minimal cellular resolution. In particular, when the algebra determined by the image of the toric Frobenius morphism is directable, then it is Koszul and admits a minimal cellular resolution.</description>

      <title>Topological Generalization Bounds for Discrete-Time Stochastic Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology has been the subject of much study in knot theory and low dimensional topology since 2000. This work introduces a Khovanov Laplacian and a Khovanov Dirac to study knot and link diagrams. The harmonic spectrum of the Khovanov Laplacian or the Khovanov Dirac retains the topological invariants of Khovanov homology, while their non-harmonic spectra reveal additional information that is distinct from Khovanov homology.</description>
