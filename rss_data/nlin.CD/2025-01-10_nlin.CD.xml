      <title>Local predictors of explosive synchronization with ordinal methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use the ordinal pattern transition (OPT) entropy measured at sentinel central nodes as a potential predictor of explosive transitions to synchronization in networks of various dynamical systems with increasing complexity. Our results demonstrate that the OPT entropic measure surpasses traditional early warning signals (EWS) measures and could be valuable to the tools available for predicting critical transitions. In particular, we investigate networks of diffusively coupled phase oscillators and chaotic R\"ossler systems. As maps, we consider a neural network of Chialvo maps coupled in star and scale-free configurations. Furthermore, we apply this measure to time series data obtained from a network of electronic circuits operating in the chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous emulation and downscaling with physically-consistent deep learning-based regional ocean emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on top of the success in AI-based atmospheric emulation, we propose an AI-based ocean emulation and downscaling framework focusing on the high-resolution regional ocean over Gulf of Mexico. Regional ocean emulation presents unique challenges owing to the complex bathymetry and lateral boundary conditions as well as from fundamental biases in deep learning-based frameworks, such as instability and hallucinations. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based framework to autoregressively integrate ocean-surface variables over the Gulf of Mexico at $8$ Km spatial resolution without unphysical drifts over decadal time scales and simulataneously downscale and bias-correct it to $4$ Km resolution using a physics-constrained generative model. The framework shows both short-term skills as well as accurate long-term statistics in terms of mean and variability.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, and its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems have not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith, as well as each individual reflection and transmission time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with scattering singularities such as coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each time-delay quantity are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, number of scattering channels $M$, Dyson symmetry class $\beta$, and uniform attenuation $\eta$. The tails determine the abundance of the singularities in generic scattering systems, and the superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established statistics of unitary systems, where the distribution tail depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. We relate the statistics to the topological properties of the corresponding singularities. Although the results presented here are based on classical microwave experiments, they are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as optical or acoustic resonators.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>
