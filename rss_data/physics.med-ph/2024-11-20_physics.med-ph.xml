      <title>Performance of Large Language Models in Technical MRI Question Answering: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have the potential to enhance technical expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of operator skill or geographic location.
  Methods: We assessed the accuracy of several LLMs in answering 570 technical MRI questions derived from a standardized review book. The questions spanned nine MRI topics, including Basic Principles, Image Production, and Safety. Closed-source models (e.g., OpenAI's o1 Preview, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) and open-source models (e.g., Phi 3.5 Mini, Llama 3.1, smolLM2) were tested. Models were queried using standardized prompts via the LangChain framework, and responses were graded against correct answers using an automated scoring protocol. Accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct answers, was the primary outcome.
  Results: The closed-source o1 Preview model achieved the highest accuracy (94%), exceeding the random-guess baseline (26.5%). GPT-4o and o1 Mini scored 88%, and GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Haiku each scored 84%. Among open-source models, Phi 3.5 Mini performed well, achieving 78% accuracy, comparable to several closed-source models. Accuracy was highest in Basic Principles and Instrumentation categories but lower in Image Weighting and Contrast, History, and Artifacts and Corrections.
  Conclusions: LLMs exhibit high accuracy in addressing technical MRI questions, suggesting their potential to standardize and enhance MRI practice. These models may improve image quality and consistency across varied clinical environments. Further studies are needed to refine LLMs for clinical use and integrate them into MRI workflows.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Vibrational Frequency of Canine Vocal Folds Using a Two-Way Fluid-Solid Interaction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction Speech is an integral component of human communication, requiring the coordinated efforts of various organs to produce sound (Titze &amp; Alipour, 2006). The glottis region, a key player in voice production, assumes a crucial role in this intricate process. As air, emanating from the lungs in a confined space, interacts with the vocal folds (VFs) within the human body, it gives rise to the creation of voice (Alipour &amp; Vigmostad, 2012). Understanding the mechanical intricacies of this process is very important. Studying VFs in vivo situations is hard work. However, the orientation, shape and size of VFs fibers have been extracted with synchrotron X-ray microtomography. (Bailly et al., 2018) The investigation of mechanical properties of both human and animal VFs has been carried out through various methodologies in the literature. The mechanical properties of VFs have been studied using the uniaxial extension test (Alipour &amp; Vigmostad, 2012) assuming a linear behavior, while the nonlinearity and anisotropy of VFs has been determined using a multiscale method as in Miri et al. (2013). Pipette aspiration has also been used to extract in vivo elastic properties of VFs (Scheible et al., 2023). Mechanical behavior of VFs layers in tension, compression and shear has been studied. (Cochereau et al., 2020). Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations provide a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of voice production (Ghorbani et al. 2022). These simulations allow us to model the dynamic interplay between the VFs and air. Our research focuses on investigating the mechanical properties of canine vocal folds and utilizing these findings in an FSI simulation. Through this simulation, we aim to unravel how these mechanical properties affect voice production.Methods To investigate the mechanical properties of canine VFs, an in vitro study was conducted involving 6 mixedbreed dogs. The samples were harvested from canine cadavers euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. In the following, the VFs were harvested and tested upon 3-4 hours post-animal sacrifice. Experimental trials were carried out using the STM-1 device (SANTAM Co.), equipped with a 100 kg load cell. Seven uniaxial tensile tests were done on each sample, with displacement rates of 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 mm/min. The very slow rate of 1 mm/min was chosen to assess only elastic properties eliminating viscosity effects. Various hyperelastic models were used to fit the experimental data. Subsequently, for each model, both the mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined for the hyperelastic model parameters and their residuals. For FSI analysis we used a simplified laryngeal model as a hollow cylinder with a diameter of 50 mm and a thickness of 3 mm. The overall length of the larynx was set at 100 mm. The VFs were modeled as a circular disc with a small elliptical fissure in the midst of the cylinder section. Boundary conditions were established based on pressure differentials, with the inlet gauge pressure set at 1200 Pa and the relative pressure at the outlet set to 0. To account for the turbulent nature of airflow within the larynx, we employed the K-epsilon method to solve the motion differential equations in a two-way fluid-structure interaction simulation using ANSYS FLUENT 2021. This approach enabled us to investigate how the acquired mechanical properties of canine vocal folds affect the FSI simulations during phonation, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of their impact. To determine the vibrational frequency of VFs, we calculated the time it took to reach maximum displacement and then quadrupled this value to obtain the period of vibration.</description>

      <title>Rapid Differentiation between Microplastic Particles Using Integrated Microwave Cytometry with 3D Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid identification of microparticles in liquid is an important problem in environmental and biomedical applications such as for microplastic detection in water sources and physiological fluids. Existing spectro-scopic techniques are usually slow and not compatible with flow-through systems. Here we analyze single microparticles in the 14 - 20 micrometer range using a combination of two electronic sensors in the same microfluidic system: a microwave capacitive sensor and a resistive pulse sensor. Together, this integrated sen-sor system yields the effective electrical permittivity of the analyte particles. To simplify data analysis, 3D electrode arrangements were used instead of planar electrodes, so that the generated signal is unaffected by the height of the particle in the microfluidic channel. With this platform, we were able to distinguish between polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microparticles. We showcase the sensitivity and speed of this tech-nique and discuss the implications for the future application of microwave cytometry technology in the en-vironmental and biomedical fields.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of PET-enabled dual-energy CT imaging: First physical phantom and initial patient results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) in PET/CT is commonly operated with a single energy, resulting in a limitation of lacking tissue composition information. Dual-energy (DE) spectral CT enables material decomposition by using two different x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved multimodality imaging, but would either require hardware upgrade or increase radiation dose due to the added second x-ray CT scan. Recently proposed PET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy spectral imaging using a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. A gamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV can be generated from the existing time-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) approach and is then combined with the low-energy x-ray CT image to form dual-energy spectral imaging. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel MLAA method was further proposed by incorporating x-ray CT as a priori information. The concept of this PET-enabled DECT has been validated using simulation studies, but not yet with 3D real data. In this work, we developed a general open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction from PET data and use this implementation for the first real data validation with both a physical phantom study and a human subject study on a uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of this method for spectral imaging and material decomposition.</description>

      <title>Single-pulse Gy-scale irradiation of biological cells at $10^{13}$ Gy/s average dose-rates from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental characterization of a laser-wakefield accelerator able to deliver, in a single pulse, doses in excess of \unit[1]{Gy} on timescales of the order of a hundred femtoseconds, reaching unprecedented average dose-rates up to \unit[10$^{13}$]{Gy/s}. The irradiator is demonstrated to deliver doses tuneable up to \unit[2.2]{Gy} in a cm$^2$ area and with a high degree of longitudinal and transverse uniformity in a single irradiation. In this regime, proof-of-principle irradiation of patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells and human skin fibroblast cells show indications of a differential cellular response, when compared to reference irradiations at conventional dose-rates. These include a statistically significant increase in relative biological effectiveness ($1.40\pm0.08$ at 50\% survival for both cell lines) and a significant reduction of the relative radioresistance of tumour cells. Data analysis provides preliminary indications that these effects might not be fully explained by induced oxygen depletion in the cells but may be instead linked to a higher complexity of the damages triggered by the ultra-high density of ionising tracks of femtosecond-scale radiation pulses. These results demonstrate an integrated platform for systematic radiobiological studies at unprecedented beam durations and dose-rates, a unique infrastructure for translational research in radiobiology at the femtosecond scale.</description>

      <title>Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation from [18F]F-FDG PET/CT Images Based on 3D Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Head and neck (H&amp;N) cancers are among the most prevalent types of cancer worldwide, and [18F]F-FDG PET/CT is widely used for H&amp;N cancer management. Recently, the diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable performance in various image-generation tasks. In this work, we proposed a 3D diffusion model to accurately perform H&amp;N tumor segmentation from 3D PET and CT volumes. The 3D diffusion model was developed considering the 3D nature of PET and CT images acquired. During the reverse process, the model utilized a 3D UNet structure and took the concatenation of PET, CT, and Gaussian noise volumes as the network input to generate the tumor mask. Experiments based on the HECKTOR challenge dataset were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion model. Several state-of-the-art techniques based on U-Net and Transformer structures were adopted as the reference methods. Benefits of employing both PET and CT as the network input as well as further extending the diffusion model from 2D to 3D were investigated based on various quantitative metrics and the uncertainty maps generated. Results showed that the proposed 3D diffusion model could generate more accurate segmentation results compared with other methods. Compared to the diffusion model in 2D format, the proposed 3D model yielded superior results. Our experiments also highlighted the advantage of utilizing dual-modality PET and CT data over only single-modality data for H&amp;N tumor segmentation.</description>
