      <title>New Bounds on Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Corrections to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Poynting momentum driven particle rotation by cylindrically polarized Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaginary Poynting momentum (IPM) provides a new degree of freedom for particle manipulation. However, the application of IPM in experiments has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the IPM driven particle rotation by cylindrically polarized Gaussian beams with no spin or orbital angular momentum. Theoretical analysis and experimental measurements demonstrate that gold microparticles will be rotated in the azimuthal direction while confined in the radial direction. We achieved controllable rotation of the particle by tuning the cylindrical polarization state. Interestingly, the transfer of IPM to a gold particle is demonstrated to be competitive with that of spin angular momentum. These findings hold promising in light-matter interactions and particle manipulations.</description>

      <title>Constructing Berry-Maxwell equations with Lorentz invariance and Gauss' law of Weyl monopoles in 4D energy-momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the construction of a reciprocal electromagnetic field by extending the Berry curvatures into four-dimensional (4D) energy-momentum space. The resulting governing equations, termed Berry-Maxwell equations, are derived, by incorporating Lorentz invariance to constrain the parameter space of energy-momentum. Notably, these Berry-Maxwell equations exhibit dual and self-dual structures compared to the Maxwell equations. The very existence of Berry-Maxwell equations is independent of the geometrical phase of matter waves, implying that they cannot be directly derived from the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Indeed, we find that the physical reality of this reciprocal electromagnetic field is rooted in the fundamental principles of special relativity and Gauss's law of Weyl monopoles. To validate our theory experimentally, we outline three effects for verification: (i) Lorentz boost of a Weyl monopole, (ii) reciprocal Thouless pumping, and (iii) plane-wave solutions of Berry-Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Topological dynamics of continuum lattice structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum lattice structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. Here, first, we reveal the topological dynamics of continuous beam structures by rigorously proving the existence of infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps. Then, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the Zak phase that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to general continuum lattice structures. We demonstrate the topological edge states of bridge-like frames, plates, and continuous beams on elastic foundations and springs, and the topological corner states of kagome frames. The continuum lattice structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topologically protected states at multifrequencies, and their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>
