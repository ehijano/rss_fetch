      <title>2-Segal sets and pseudomonoids in the bicategory of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey article, we give an introduction to the notion of a 2-Segal set and prove that 2-Segal sets are equivalent to pseudomonoids in the bicategory of spans. The proof utilizes graphical techniques for 2-Segal sets and spans that should be useful in more general settings.
  There are procedures for obtaining an associative algebra from a 2-Segal set (satisfying finiteness conditions). We describe these procedures and give several examples of algebras arising from 2-Segal sets.
  Wherever possible, we avoid higher category theory so as to make the paper accessible to a wide audience.</description>

      <title>Recursive Difference Categories and Topos-Theoretic Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a radically minimal categorical foundation for logic, semantics, and computation, built from a single generative axiom of recursive difference. From the null mnema M0 and iterated labeled extensions by D, we form the free category M and its sheaf topos Sh(M). We prove:
  Modal completeness: Lawvere-Tierney topologies on Sh(M) classify all standard modal logics (K, T, S4, S5) purely via submonoids of the free monoid D*.
  Fixed-point expressivity: The internal mu-calculus over infinite branching realizes the full Janin-Walukiewicz theorem.
  ZFC and Set-modeling: Sh(M) embeds Set via constant sheaves and internalizes a model of ZFC by recursive descent.
  Turing encodability: Finite-automaton and Turing-machine sheaves arise syntactically, yielding a fully mechanizable internal semantics.
  Internal meta-theorems: Godel completeness and Lowenheim-Skolem hold internally via total descent and vanishing first cohomology H1.
  We further construct faithful geometric embeddings:
  Set -&gt; Sh(M) -&gt; Eff, and Sh(M) -&gt; sSet,
  connecting to realizability and simplicial frameworks. Unlike HoTT and classical site-theoretic models, Sh(M) exhibits total cohomological triviality, no torsors, and fully conservative gluing of all local data. Thus, we realize Lawvere's vision of deriving semantics-modal, set-theoretic, computational, and meta-logical-entirely from one syntactic axiom, unifying logic, semantics, and computation under a single recursive principle.</description>

      <title>Foundations of superstack theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of applications to the construction of moduli spaces of objects in algebraic supergeometry, we start a systematic study of stacks in that context. After defining a superstack as a stack over the \'etale site of superschemes, we define quotient superstacks, and, based on previous literature, we see that, in analogy with superschemes, every superstack has an underlying ordinary stack, which we call its bosonic reduction. Then we progressively introduce more structure, considering algebraic superspaces, Deligne-Mumford superstacks and algebraic superstacks. We study the topology of algebraic superstacks and several properties of morphisms between them. We introduce quasi-coherent sheaves, and the sheaves of relative differentials. An important issue is how to check that an algebraic superstack is Deligne-Mumford, and we generalize to this setting the usual criteria in terms of the unramifiedness of the diagonal of the stack. Two appendices are devoted to collecting the basic definitions of group superschemes and principal superbundles, and to stating and analyzing some properties of morphisms of superschemes, that are at the basis of the study of morphisms of superstacks in the main text.</description>

      <title>Categorical Lyapunov Theory II: Stability of Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyapunov's theorem provides a foundational characterization of stable equilibrium points in dynamical systems. In this paper, we develop a framework for stability for F-coalgebras. We give two definitions for a categorical setting in which we can study the stability of a coalgebra for an endofunctor F. One is minimal and better suited for concrete settings, while the other is more intricate and provides a richer theory. We prove a Lyapunov theorem for both notions of setting for stability, and a converse Lyapunov theorem for the second.</description>

      <title>A modern perspective on rational homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Quillen's paper on rational homotopy theory, the category of 1-reduced simplicial sets is endowed with a family of model structures, the most prominent of which is the one whose weak equivalences are the rational homotopy equivalences. In this paper, we give a modern approach to this family of model structures.</description>

      <title>A categorification of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT with application to TQFTs and once-extended TQFTs derived from strict omega-groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first revisit the construction of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, which depends on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$. This constitutes a vast generalisation of the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT, with a trivial cocycle, and of Yetter's homotopy 2-type TQFT. We build our construction directly from homotopy theoretical techniques, and hence, as in Quinn's original notes from 1995, the construction works in all dimensions.
  Our aim in this is to provide background for giving in detail the construction of a once-extended TQFT categorifying Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, in the form of a symmetric monoidal bifunctor from the bicategory of manifolds, cobordisms and extended cobordisms, first to the symmetric monoidal bicategory of profunctors (enriched over vector spaces), and then to the Morita bicategory of algebras, bimodules and bimodule maps. These once-extended versions of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT likewise are defined for all dimensions, and, as with the original version, depend on the choice of a homotopy finite space, $\boldsymbol{B}$.
  To show the utility of this approach, we explicitly compute both Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT, and its extended version, for the case when $\boldsymbol{B}$ is the classifying space of a homotopy finite omega-groupoid, in this paper taking the form of a crossed complex, following Brown and Higgins.
  The constructions in this paper include, in particular, the description of once-extended TQFTs derived from the classifying space of a finite strict 2-group, of relevance for modelling discrete higher gauge theory, although the techniques involved are considerably more general.</description>

      <title>Towards a double operadic theory of systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for categorical systems theory which packages a collection of open systems, their interactions, and their maps into a symmetric monoidal loose right module of systems over a symmetric monoidal double category of interfaces and interactions. As examples, we give detailed descriptions of (1) the module of open Petri nets over undirected wiring diagrams and (2) the module of deterministic Moore machines over lenses. We define several pseudo-functorial constructions of modules of systems in the form of doctrines of systems theories. In particular, we introduce doctrines for port-plugging systems, variable sharing systems, and generalized Moore machines, each of which generalizes existing work in categorical systems theory. Finally, we observe how diagrammatic interaction patterns are free processes in particular doctrines.</description>

      <title>Galois descent for motivic theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary conditions for a category fibred in pseudo-abelian additive categories over the classifying topos of a profinite group to be a stack; these conditions are sufficient when the coefficients are $\mathbf{Q}$-linear. This applies to pure motives over a field in the sense of Grothendieck, Deligne-Milne and Andr\'e, to mixed motives in the sense of Nori and to several motivic categories considered in arXiv:1506.08386 [math.AG]. We also give a simple proof of the exactness of a sequence of motivic Galois groups under a Galois extension of the base field, which applies to all the above (Tannakian) situations. Finally, we clarify the construction of the categories of Chow-Lefschetz motives given in arXiv:2302.08327 [math.AG] and simplify the computation of their motivic Galois group in the numerical case.</description>

      <title>Limits over orbit categories of locally finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We correct an error in the paper [BLO3], and take the opportunity to examine in more detail the derived functors of inverse limits over orbit categories of (infinite) locally finite groups. The main results show how to reduce this in many cases to limits over orbit categories of finite groups, but we also look at generalizations of the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for higher limits over orbit categories for an extension of locally finite groups.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Feigin-Frenkel Duality at the Critical Level to Matrices of Complex Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Feigin-Frenkel duality at the critical level to the setting of complex rank. This is accomplished by considering the center of a vertex algebra in Deligne's interpolating categories, along with Feigin's Lie algebras of complex rank, $\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda}$ and $\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda}$. More precisely, we define the universal affine vertex algebras associated with Lie algebras in $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{GL}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$, $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{O}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$ and $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{Sp}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$, and describe their centers at the critical level explicitly by interpolating Molev's construction of Segal-Sugawara vectors. Using the formalism of Poisson vertex algebras, we identify a natural set of generators for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of $\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda}$ and $\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda}$, denoted by $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda})$ and $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda})$, respectively. Finally, we show that the interpolated Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism maps the interpolated Segal-Sugawara vectors to these generators.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Quillen's D\'evissage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a different proof of Quillen's D\'evissage theorem using Barwick's theorem of the heart. The key ingredient is a certain short exact sequence of dg categories, which is closely related with the Auslander-type construction for nilpotent extensions which was used in the papers of Kuznetsov-Lunts \cite{KL15}, Land-Tamme \cite{LT19} and the author \cite{E20}.</description>
