      <title>Real-Time Health Analytics Using Ontology-Driven Complex Event Processing and LLM Reasoning: A Tuberculosis Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely detection of critical health conditions remains a major challenge in public health analytics, especially in Big Data environments characterized by high volume, rapid velocity, and diverse variety of clinical data. This study presents an ontology-enabled real-time analytics framework that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intelligent health event detection and semantic reasoning over heterogeneous, high-velocity health data streams. The architecture leverages the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to model diagnostic rules and domain knowledge. Patient data is ingested and processed using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming, where CEP engines detect clinically significant event patterns. LLMs support adaptive reasoning, event interpretation, and ontology refinement. Clinical information is semantically structured as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples in Graph DB, enabling SPARQL-based querying and knowledge-driven decision support. The framework is evaluated using a dataset of 1,000 Tuberculosis (TB) patients as a use case, demonstrating low-latency event detection, scalable reasoning, and high model performance (in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score). These results validate the system's potential for generalizable, real-time health analytics in complex Big Data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Targeted Sequential Pattern Mining with High Average Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating utility into targeted pattern mining can address the practical limitations of traditional frequency-based approaches. However, utility-based methods often suffer from generating a large number of long and complicated sequences. To improve pattern relevance and interpretability, average utility provides a more balanced metric by considering both utility and sequence length. Moreover, incorporating user-defined query targets into the mining process enhances usability and interactivity by retaining only patterns containing user-specified goals. To address challenges related to mining efficiency in large-scale, long-sequence datasets, this study introduces average utility into targeted sequential pattern mining. A novel algorithm, TAUSQ-PG, is designed to find targeted high average utility sequential patterns. It incorporates efficient filtering and pruning strategies, tighter upper bound models, as well as novel specialized evaluation metrics and query flags tailored to this task. Extensive comparative experiments on different datasets demonstrate that TAUSQ-PG effectively controls the candidate set size, thereby reducing redundant sequence generation and significantly improving runtime and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI): A Comprehensive Framework for Integrated Relational and Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of complex, multimodal datasets has exposed a critical gap between the capabilities of specialized vector databases and traditional graph databases. While vector databases excel at semantic similarity search, they lack the capacity for deep relational querying. Conversely, graph databases master complex traversals but are not natively optimized for high-dimensional vector search. This paper introduces the Hybrid Multimodal Graph Index (HMGI), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap by creating a unified system for efficient, hybrid queries on multimodal data. HMGI leverages the native graph database architecture and integrated vector search capabilities, exemplified by platforms like Neo4j, to combine Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) with expressive graph traversal queries. Key innovations of the HMGI framework include modality-aware partitioning of embeddings to optimize index structure and query performance, and a system for adaptive, low-overhead index updates to support dynamic data ingestion, drawing inspiration from the architectural principles of systems like TigerVector. By integrating semantic similarity search directly with relational context, HMGI aims to outperform pure vector databases like Milvus in complex, relationship-heavy query scenarios and achieve sub-linear query times for hybrid tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mining of Low-Utility Sequential Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering valuable insights from rich data is a crucial task for exploratory data analysis. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has found widespread applications across various domains. In recent years, low-utility sequential pattern mining (LUSPM) has shown strong potential in applications such as intrusion detection and genomic sequence analysis. However, existing research in utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the definitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied to LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for mining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize the LUSPM problem, redefine sequence utility, and introduce a compact data structure called the sequence-utility chain to efficiently record utility information. Furthermore, we propose three novel algorithm--LUSPM_b, LUSPM_s, and LUSPM_e--to discover the complete set of low-utility sequential patterns. LUSPM_b serves as an exhaustive baseline, while LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e build upon it, generating subsequences through shrinkage and extension operations, respectively. In addition, we introduce the maximal non-mutually contained sequence set and incorporate multiple pruning strategies, which significantly reduce redundant operations in both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e substantially outperform LUSPM_b and exhibit excellent scalability. Notably, LUSPM_e achieves superior efficiency, requiring less runtime and memory consumption than LUSPM_s. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhidong-Lin/LUSPM.</description>

      <title>Regular Expression Indexing for Log Analysis. Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and architecture of REI, a novel system for indexing log data for regular expression queries. Our main contribution is an $n$-gram-based indexing strategy and an efficient storage mechanism that results in a speedup of up to 14x compared to state-of-the-art regex processing engines that do not use indexing, using only 2.1% of extra space. We perform a detailed study that analyzes the space usage of the index and the improvement in workload execution time, uncovering interesting insights. Specifically, we show that even an optimized implementation of strategies such as inverted indexing, which are widely used in text processing libraries, may lead to suboptimal performance for regex indexing on log analysis tasks. Overall, the REI approach presented in this paper provides a significant boost when evaluating regular expression queries on log data. REI is also modular and can work with existing regular expression packages, making it easy to deploy in a variety of settings. The code of REI is available at https://github.com/mush-zhang/REI-Regular-Expression-Indexing.</description>

      <title>AQORA: A Learned Adaptive Query Optimizer for Spark SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified two main approaches to improve query optimization: learned query optimization (LQO), which generates or selects better query plans before execution based on models trained in advance, and adaptive query processing (AQP), which adapts the query plan during execution based on statistical feedback collected at runtime. Although both approaches have shown promise, they also face critical limitations. LQO must commit to a fixed plan without access to actual cardinalities and typically rely on a single end-to-end feedback signal, making learning inefficient. On the other hand, AQP depends heavily on rule-based heuristics and lacks the ability to learn from experience. In this paper, we present AQORA, an adaptive query optimizer with a reinforcement learning architecture that combines the strengths of both LQO and AQP. AQORA addresses the above challenges through four core strategies: (1) realistic feature encoding, (2) query stage-level feedback and intervention, (3) automatic strategy adaptation, and (4) low-cost integration. Experiments show that AQORA reduces end-to-end execution time by up to 90% compared to other learned methods and by up to 70% compared to Spark SQL's default configuration with adaptive query execution.</description>

      <title>DriftBench: Defining and Generating Data and Query Workload Drift for Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data and workload drift are key to evaluating database components such as caching, cardinality estimation, indexing, and query optimization. Yet, existing benchmarks are static, offering little to no support for modeling drift. This limitation stems from the lack of clear definitions and tools for generating data and workload drift. Motivated by this gap, we propose a unified taxonomy for data and workload drift, grounded in observations from both academia and industry. Building on this foundation, we introduce DriftBench, a lightweight and extensible framework for generating data and workload drift in benchmark inputs. Together, the taxonomy and DriftBench provide a standardized vocabulary and mechanism for modeling and generating drift in benchmarking. We demonstrate their effectiveness through case studies involving data drift, workload drift, and drift-aware cardinality estimation.</description>

      <title>GrASP: A Generalizable Address-based Semantic Prefetcher for Scalable Transactional and Analytical Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is essential for reducing I/O overhead and improving database performance. While traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning. Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets, necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to predict delta patterns from embedded context. This delta modeling approach enables GrASP to generalize predictions from small samples to larger, dynamic datasets without requiring extensive retraining. Experiments on real-world datasets and industrial benchmarks demonstrate that GrASP generalizes to datasets 250 times larger than the training data, achieving up to 45% higher hit ratios, 60% lower I/O time, and 55% lower end-to-end query execution latency than existing baselines. On average, GrASP attains a 91.4% hit ratio, a 90.8% I/O time reduction, and a 57.1% execution latency reduction.</description>

      <title>Poseidon: A OneGraph Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Poseidon engine behind the Neptune Analytics graph database service. Customers interact with Poseidon using the declarative openCypher query language, which enables requests that seamlessly combine traditional querying paradigms (such as graph pattern matching, variable length paths, aggregation) with algorithm invocations and has been syntactically extended to facilitate OneGraph interoperability, such as the disambiguation between globally unique IRIs (as exposed via RDF) vs. local identifiers (as encountered in LPG data). Poseidon supports a broad range of graph workloads, from simple transactions, to top-k beam search algorithms on dynamic graphs, to whole graph analytics requiring multiple full passes over the data. For example, real-time fraud detection, like many other use cases, needs to reflect current committed state of the dynamic graph. If a users cell phone is compromised, then all newer actions by that user become immediately suspect. To address such dynamic graph use cases, Poseidon combines state-of-the-art transaction processing with novel graph data indexing, including lock-free maintenance of adjacency lists, secondary succinct indices, partitioned heaps for data tuple storage with uniform placement, and innovative statistics for cost-based query optimization. The Poseidon engine uses a logical log for durability, enabling rapid evolution of in-memory data structures. Bulk data loads achieve more than 10 million property values per second on many data sets while simple transactions can execute in under 20ms against the storage engine.</description>

      <title>Aegis: A Correlation-Based Data Masking Advisor for Data Sharing Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility. Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms) or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks that is on par with baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Agentic Workflows: Evaluating Inference-Based Test-Time Scaling Strategies in Text2SQL Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs, including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity when deploying Text2SQL systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Explainable Enterprise Knowledge Discovery Using Graph-Centric Hybrid Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization, the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.</description>

      <title>How to Get Actual Privacy and Utility from Privacy Models: the k-Anonymity and Differential Privacy Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy models were introduced in privacy-preserving data publishing and statistical disclosure control with the promise to end the need for costly empirical assessment of disclosure risk. We examine how well this promise is kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation. Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets. In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic k-anonymity.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Sketches for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams without Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times. To help further research and development, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Y-debug-sys/UCL-sketch.</description>

Abstract: Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics: when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single, destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices.</description>
