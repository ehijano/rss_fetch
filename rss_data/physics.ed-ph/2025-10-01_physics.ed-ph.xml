      <title>Developing signal processing skills: A proposal for the teaching of filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In accordance with Bloom's taxonomy, a four-level evaluation abstraction was generated with the objective of structuring and hierarchizing curricula knowledge, allowing students to dominate a subject and progressively reach the top of Bloom's pyramid. The evaluation was conducted with 10 university students who analyzed and optimized a filtering process using MATLAB simulation while constrained by time. The results demonstrate that this novel teaching method facilitates a more profound comprehension of the subject for students with diverse learning styles in science.</description>

      <title>Help or Hype? Students' Engagement and Perception of Using AI to Solve Physics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models such as ChatGPT, interest has grown in understanding how these tools influence learning in STEM education, including physics. This study explores how students use ChatGPT during a physics problem-solving task embedded in a formal assessment. We analyzed patterns of AI usage and their relationship to student performance. Findings indicate that students who engaged with ChatGPT generally performed better than those who did not. Particularly, students who provided more complete and contextual prompts experienced greater benefits. Further, students who demonstrated overall positive gains collectively asked more conceptual questions than those who exhibited overall negative gains. However, the presence of incorrect AI-generated responses also underscores the importance of critically evaluating AI output. These results suggest that while AI can be a valuable aid in problem solving, its effectiveness depends significantly on how students use it, reinforcing the need to incorporate structured AI-literacy into STEM education.</description>

      <title>Integrating noise into PhET simulations to promote student learning of measurement uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding concepts and practices of measurement uncertainty is a core competency of physicists and engineers, and many physics lab courses aim to have students learn these ideas. However, there is strong evidence that these goals are often not met. To address the challenge of improving students' proficiency with measurement uncertainty concepts and practices, we designed and developed a new PhET simulation, Projectile Data Lab (PDL), featuring statistical noise and measurement tools in the context of projectile motion. We integrated this simulation into the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP), creating an instructional platform for collecting and analyzing data from the simulation, and designed three simulation-based instructional activities for instructors to use in their lab courses. We describe the pedagogical design of the new simulation, the PDL+CODAP instructional platform, and the associated instructional activities. We highlight how the targeted learning goals guided the pedagogical design, as well as how these three instructional tools (the simulation, the PDL+CODAP platform, and the lab activity) work together and leverage the affordances of each to scaffold learning. The goal of this work is to provide a model of how noise-enhanced simulations and activities can be designed to enhance student learning of measurement uncertainty.</description>
