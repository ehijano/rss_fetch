      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Anomalous Transport Phenomena in Strongly Interacting Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) and the Chiral Separation Effect (CSE) using lattice QCD simulations. We completely characterize the CSE in QCD using $2+1$ simulations of staggered quarks tuned at the physical point. We find that the CSE conductivity is severely suppressed at low temperatures, and experiences a very sharp increase around the QCD crossover transition, reaching the value of massless non-interacting fermions at high temperatures. This is the first non-perturbative calculation of an anomalous transport conductivity in physical QCD. In the case of the CME, we show that this effect is not present in thermal equilibrium, in accordance with Bloch's theorem, both for free fermions and in QCD. We emphasize the crucial role of using a conserved vector current in the study of anomalous transport phenomena on the lattice, and how the use of non-conserved currents is behind non-vanishing results for the CME in equilibrium that can be found in the literature. Finally, we study the interplay between the CME and inhomogeneous magnetic fields, which leads us to find a novel localized CME signal in equilibrium. This does not contradict Bloch's theorem, since the total signal averages to zero when summed over the full volume. This effect is present in physical QCD, showing that a local equilibrium CME signal is possible in the presence of gluonic interactions.</description>

      <title>To Break or Not to Break: A Review of a No-Go Theorem on Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of some recent progress in rigorously proving chiral symmetry breaking in a class of QCD-like theories that closely resemble the real-world QCD, namely the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representation. Based on 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions, a general no-go theorem is formulated: assuming that the theory flows in the infrared to a fully color-screened, infrared-free phase described by color-singlet hadrons, symmetry and anomaly constraints necessarily imply spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking; conversely, any phase with unbroken chiral symmetry must retain unscreened color charges, thereby ruling out a fully color-singlet hadron description in the infrared. While these results have been widely assumed, the recent developments reviewed here establish them with a new level of rigor. The persistent mass condition, carefully formulated here, plays a central role, just as it does in the Vafa-Witten theorem on unbroken vectorlike symmetries.</description>

      <title>New computational methods in lattice gauge theory -- quantum computation and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group invariant mean-field model for QCD at finite isospin density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potentials has phenomenological relevance for a series of physical systems and provides an ideal testground for the modeling of dense strongly interacting matter. The two-flavor quark-meson model is known to effectively describe the condensation of charged pions in QCD that occurs in this setting. In this paper, we derive a renormalization-group invariant mean-field formulation of the model and demonstrate that the resulting phase diagram and equation of state are in quantitative agreement with data from lattice QCD simulations at small and intermediate isospin chemical potentials. In particular, the speed of sound from the model shows an excess over the conformal bound as previously seen in lattice computations in agreement with chiral perturbation theory. We then consider the speed of sound in the limit of large isospin chemical potentials and see that it approaches the conformal limit from above, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice results and in quantitative agreement with perturbation theory in the presence of a BCS gap. Finally, we consider the phase diagram in the approach to the chiral limit. We find that within the model the chiral phase transition connects to the pion condensation phase boundary in the chiral limit and we discuss the implications for the properties of the chiral transition point.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. Taking into account both the mass ordering and the decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$, respectively. We first calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. The obtained mass results for the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ are $4.442$ and $4.457$ GeV, respectively. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are $21.8$ MeV and $13.0$ MeV, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. Our results suggest that $\bar D^{0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Treating baryons as quark + interacting-diquark bound states, a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) is used to deliver an extensive, coherent set of predictions for $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryon unpolarised and polarised distribution functions (DFs) -- valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea -- and compare them with those of a like-structured nucleon. $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryons are strangeness negative-one isospin partners within the SU$(3)$-flavour baryon octet. This makes such structural comparisons significant. The study reveals impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking on $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ structure functions, some of which are significant. For instance, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$ at the hadron scale, the $s$ quark could carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin. The discussion canvasses issues that include helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs; and the origin and decomposition of baryon spins. Interpreted judiciously, the SCI analysis delivers an insightful explanation of baryon structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</description>
