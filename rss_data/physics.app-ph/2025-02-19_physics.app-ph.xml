      <title>Ratchet-based ion Pumps for fine-tuning of electrochemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of electrochemical reactions can greatly enhance the performance of electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. However, electrochemical reactions are extremely sensitive to the physical and chemical environment. Thus, controlling the electrolyte ionic composition and the electrochemical potential of specific ions in the vicinity of the electrodes can enhance their selectivity towards the desired products and modify the overpotential of redox reactions. Here, we show that ion pumps based on a ratcheting mechanism can be used to tune the overpotentials of electrochemical reactions. Flashing ratchets are devices that utilize the temporal modulation of a spatially asymmetric electric field to drive a non-zero time-averaged current. We have recently demonstrated experimentally first-of-their-kind ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs). Since the ion pumping modifies the electrochemical potential of ions, and redox reaction rates are determined by the electrochemical potential, ratchet-based ion pumping provides an additional degree of freedom in tuning electrochemical reaction rates and overpotentials. RBIPs were fabricated by coating the two surfaces of nano-porous alumina wafers with gold, forming nano-porous capacitors. The electric field within the nano-pores was modulated by oscillating the capacitor voltage. When immersed in solution, ions within the pores experienced a modulating electric field, resulting in ratchet-based ion pumping. The RBIP was placed as a membrane between two Pt electrodes immersed in solution. The application of an input signal to the ratchet was shown to accelerate or inhibit redox reactions on the surface of the Pt electrodes according to the ratchet input signal properties. Ion pumping may allow tuning of the electrolyte content at the vicinity of the electrodes, thus providing another degree of freedom for the electrochemical process.</description>

      <title>On the Vulnerability of UMOSFETs in Terrestrial Radiation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of prominent silicon-based U-shaped Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (UMOSFET) to destructive radiation effects when operating in terrestrial atmospheric environments is addressed. It is known that secondary particles from nuclear reactions between atmospheric neutrons and the constituent materials of electronic devices can trigger Single-Event Burnout (SEB) destructive failure in power MOSFETs. The susceptibility of UMOSFETs to SEBs induced by atmospheric neutrons in accelerated tests are compared to that of similarly rated traditional Double-diffused MOSFET (DMOSFET) counterparts. Computational simulations are conducted to elucidate failure mechanisms and propose strategies to potentially enhance the survivability of next-generation UMOSFETs in high-reliability power systems operating on Earth.</description>

      <title>Low-loss polarization-maintaining router for single and entangled photons at a telecom wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of single and entangled photons at the telecom L-band. Our interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation without additional polarization-compensation optics. We demonstrate the routing of arbitrary-polarized heralded single photons with a 1.3% loss, a $&gt;$ 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and $&gt;$ 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of $\sim$ 97%. The demonstrated router scheme paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum network as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.</description>

      <title>Artificially creating emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism and its manipulation in a magnetic van-der-Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets, with their two-dimensional (2D) atomic structures, provide a unique platform for exploring magnetism at the nanoscale. Although there have been numerous reports on their diverse quantum properties, the emergent interfacial magnetism--artificially created at the interface between two layered magnets--remains largely unexplored. This work presents observations of such emergent interfacial magnetism at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface in a vdW heterostructure. We report the discovery of an intermediate Hall resistance plateau in the anomalous Hall loop, indicative of emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism fostered by the heterointerface. This plateau can be stabilized and further manipulated under varying pressures but collapses under high pressures over 10 GPa. Our theoretical calculations reveal that charge transfer at the interface is pivotal in establishing the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. This work illuminates the previously unexplored emergent interfacial magnetism at a vdW interface comprised of a ferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator, and highlights its gradual evolution under increasing pressure. These findings enrich the portfolio of emergent interfacial magnetism and support further investigations on vdW magnetic interfaces and the development of next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined STEM, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20 % of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance, highlighting the importance of weak spots in junction parameters such as resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Tri-axial time-dependent magnetic field calibrated in-situ by harmonic analysis of adiabatically evolving atomic spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology to calibrate in situ a set of coils generating bi- or tri-axial magnetic fields, at frequencies where a calibration performed under static conditions would be inaccurate. The methodology uses harmonic analysis of one component of the magnetization of an atomic sample whose spins adiabatically follow an ad hoc applied time-dependent field. The procedure enables the identification of phases and amplitudes of the coil currents required to produce a dynamic magnetic field with the assigned polarization. This determines coil constants that can be subsequently used to produce arbitrary three-dimensional time-dependent fields.</description>

      <title>A Silicon Photonic Neural Network for Chromatic Dispersion Compensation in 20 Gbps PAM4 Signal at 125 km and Its Scalability up to 100 Gbps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A feed-forward photonic neural network (PNN) is tested for chromatic dispersion compensation in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection optical links. The PNN is based on a sequence of linear and nonlinear transformations. The linear stage is constituted by an 8-tap time-delayed complex perceptron implemented on a Silicon-On-insulator platform and acting as a tunable optical filter. The nonlinear stage is provided by the square modulus of the electrical field applied at the end-of-line photodetector. The training maximizes the separation between the optical levels (i.e. the eye diagram aperture), with consequent reduction of the Bit Error Rate. Effective equalization is experimentally demonstrated for 20 Gbps 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulated signal up to 125 km. An evolutionary algorithm and a gradient-based approach are tested for the training and then compared in terms of repeatability and convergence time. The optimal weights resulting from the training are interpreted in light of the theoretical transfer function of the optical fiber. Finally, a simulative study proves the scalability of the layout to larger bandwidths, up to 100 Gbps.</description>
