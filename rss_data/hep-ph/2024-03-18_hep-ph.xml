      <title>Quark anomalous magnetic moment in an extreme magnetic background from pQCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop QCD correction to the photon-quark-antiquark vertex in an extremely strong magnetic background, i.e., one in which $\sqrt{eB}$ is much larger than all other mass scales. We resort to the lowest-Landau level approximation, and consider on-shell fermions. We find that the the total magnetic moment is such that that the anomalous magnetic moment contributes to the electric part $\sim iE_3\sigma_3$, the other contributions to $\boldsymbol{B}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ and $i\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}_\perp$ being completely suppressed. We show results for the anomalous magnetic moment of quarks up and down, scaled by their values in the vacuum, as a function of the external magnetic field, considering dressed gluons and a renormalization scale $\mu_\mathrm{\tiny \overline{ MS}}=\sqrt{|eB|}$.</description>

      <title>Three lectures on the Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lectures, we review the status of the Curci-Ferrari model as a phenomenological approach to Landau gauge-fixed YM theories in the infrared. More precisely, after discussing some of the general properties of the model, we explain in full detail the evaluation of the one-loop two-point correlators that allowed for a successful comparison to the corresponding Landau-gauge lattice data. We also review the renormalization group flow of the model which controls its fate at high and low momentum scales.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the urgent issues in high energy physics is the experimental confirmation of the electroweak monopole predicted by the standard model, and currently MoEDAL at LHC is actively searching for the monopole. However, the present LHC cannot produce the monopole if the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, while the monopole mass is expected to be around $M_W/\alpha \simeq 11~\text{TeV}$. In this paper we discuss how LHC could circumbent this energy constraint and produce the monopole even when the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, based on the following ideas. First, in the topological production of the monopole the baby monopole mass at creation could be considerably smaller than the adolescent mass. Second, the binding energy of the monopole-antimonopole pair could effectively reduce the mass of the bound state. We discuss how these ideas can actually be realized at LHC to produce the monopole pairs. In particular, we argue that LHC could produce the baby electroweak monopoles whose mass could be around 5.2 TeV, smaller than the adolescent monopole mass around 11.0 TeV. Moreover, we show that LHC could produce the monopolium bound state with mass around 5.3 TeV, even when the total mass of the monopole-antimonopole pair is around 22.0 TeV. Our analysis could play an important role for MoEDAL experiment.</description>

      <title>Power corrections to the modified QCD perturbative series based on conformal mapping of the Borel plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modifications of the QCD perturbative expansions by the subtraction of the dominant infrared renormalon have been proposed recently as attempts to solve the long-standing discrepancy between fixed-order and contour-improved perturbation theory for the hadronic $\tau$ decays. In this approach, the modified perturbative series is supplemented by a modified gluon condensate in the operator product expansion of the Adler function. Motivated by these works, we revisited recently a formulation of the QCD perturbation theory, proposed some time ago, which takes into account the renormalons by means of the conformal mapping of the Borel plane. One expects that the modified perturbative series obtained in this framework should be accompanied by modified power-suppressed nonperturbative corrections. However, in the previous studies the focus was on the perturbative series and the question of the possible power corrections has not been considered. In the present paper, we investigate for the first time this problem. Using techniques from the mathematical resurgence theory, we derive the expression of the dominant power correction to the perturbative series obtained by conformal mapping of the Borel plane, and discuss its implications for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the parameter space of the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM) is investigated to align the W-boson mass reported by the CDF experiment with recent theoretical and experimental findings. The Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model, a distinguished category within Two Higgs Doublet Models, contains two CP-even, one CP-odd, and two charged scalar bosons, which play crucial role in estimating W boson mass. First, constraints from diverse experimental data, including ATLAS 13 TeV analyses, rare B-meson decays, and Lepton Flavor Universality in tau-lepton and Z-boson decays, are determined and imposed on the parameter space of the model. These constraints are subsequently applied to potential solutions generated through random scans using SARAH 4.13.0 and analyzed using SPheno 4.0.3. The analysis indicates the possibility of realizing the CDF-reported W-boson mass up to $1\sigma$ within the low $\tan\beta$ regime ($2.5 \lesssim \tan\beta \lesssim 8.0 $). Furthermore, it establishes mass limits for the additional scalar boson as $164 \lesssim m_{h_2} \lesssim 195 $ GeV, $330 \lesssim m_{A} \lesssim 575 $ GeV, and $345 \lesssim m_{H^\pm} \lesssim 685 $ GeV. Moreover, it is observed that instead of the masses, mass differences of the new scalars of the model are more constrained to assure the CDF reported value of the W boson. Finally, all potential solutions estimating the W-boson mass within a $1\sigma$ vicinity are rigorously tested using the HiggsTools package. Remarkably, only one solution remains valid, estimating $M_W=80.4103$ GeV within a $2.44\sigma$ vicinity of the CDF-reported value.</description>

      <title>Radiative transitions of $\chi_{_{cJ}}\to\psi\gamma$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}\to\Upsilon\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation, according to the $J ^ {PC}$ of quarkonia, we find that their wave functions all contain multiple partial waves, rather than pure waves. In the radiative electromagnetic transitions $\chi_{_{cJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\Upsilon$ ($J=0,1,2$), the main wave of quarkonium gives the non-relativistic contribution, while other waves provide the relativistic corrections. Our results indicate that the relativistic effect of charmonium, especially highly excited states, is significant. Such as the relativistic effects of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi(1S)$ ($J=0,1,2$) are $\{49.7\%,~30.9\%,~37.5\%\}$, much larger than the corresponding $\{17.8\%,~7.08\%,~12.9\%\}$ of $\chi_{_{bJ}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1S)$. The decay of $\chi_{_{cJ}}(2P)\to\gamma\psi$ can be used to distinguish between $\chi_{_{c0}}(3860)$ and $\chi_{_{c0}}(3915)$, which particle is the charmonium $\chi_{_{c0}}(2P)$. Although our result of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(2S)$ is consistent with data, but the one of $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$$\rightarrow$$\gamma\psi(1S)$ is much larger than data, so whether $\chi_{_{c1}}(3872)$ is the conventional $\chi_{_{c1}}(2P)$ remains an open question. The undiscovered $\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\Upsilon(2D)$ have large production rates in decays of $\chi_{_{b0}}(2P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$ and $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(2D)$ ($J=0,1$), respectively. To search for $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)$ $(J=0,1,2)$, the most competitive channels are the decays $\chi_{_{bJ}}(3P)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(3S)$. And the best way to find $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)$ is to search for the decay of $\chi_{_{b2}}(1F)\rightarrow\gamma\Upsilon(1D)$.</description>

      <title>The masses and decay widths of the $S$-wave $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible bound states of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ system in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism in the ladder and instantaneous approximations. By numerically solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we confirm the existence of $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $J^{PC}=1^{--}$. We further investigate the partial decay widths of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states into $N\bar{N}$, $D\bar{D}$, $D\bar{D}^\ast$, $D^\ast\bar{D}^\ast$, $\pi\bar{\pi}$, and $K\bar{K}$. Our results indicate that the decay width of the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound state with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ is much larger than that with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, and among their decay channels, the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ final state is the main decay mode. We suggest experiments to search for the $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ bound states in the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ final state.</description>

      <title>$T_7$ Flavor Symmetry gym: The Key to Unlocking the Neutrino Mass Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has indicated that the Standard Model (SM), while historically highly effective, is found to be insufficient due to its prediction of zero mass for neutrinos. With the exception of a few, the majority of the parameters related to neutrinos have been determined by neutrino oscillation experiments with excellent precision. Experiments on neutrino oscillation and neutrino mixing have shown that neutrinos are massive. To fill in gaps, discrete symmetries are becoming more common alongside continuous symmetries while describing the observed pattern of neutrino mixing. Here, we present a $T_7$ flavor symmetry to explain the masses of charged leptons and neutrinos. The light neutrino mass matrix is derived using seesaw mechanism of type I, which involves the Dirac neutrino mass matrix as well as the right-handed neutrino mass matrix. We estimate the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix ($U_{PMNS}$), three mixing angles, $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$ and $\theta_{13}$, which are strongly correlated with the recent experimental results. The extent of $CP$ violation in neutrino oscillations is obtained by calculating Jarskog invariant $(J_{CP})$ on the behalf of $U_{PMNS}$. We also find the masses of three neutrinos and Effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$ which is $1.0960244138965946$ $meV$ and $10.92168920244218$ $meV$ for normal and inverted hierarchy, respectively.</description>

      <title>Next-to-Leading-Order Weak Annihilation Correction to Rare $B \to \left \{K, \pi \right \} \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We accomplish for the first time the next-to-leading-order computation of the weak annihilation contribution to the exclusive electroweak penguin decays $B \to \left \{K, \pi \right \} \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ with an energetic light-flavour meson, which is an essential missing piece of the complete QCD correction to the matrix elements of hadronic operators in the weak effective Hamiltonian. Both the hard functions and the jet functions in the perturbative factorization formulae from the short-distance fluctuations at the two distinct scales $m_b$ and $\sqrt{m_b \, \Lambda}$ are determined at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ with the soft-collinear factorization technique. We then demonstrate that the one-loop weak annihilation correction can bring about the noticeable impacts on theory predictions for the CP asymmetries and the isospin asymmetry in the $B \to \pi \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ decays.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the dynamical correlations between neutral and charged kaons in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV by the ALICE Collaboration display anomalous behavior relative to conventional heavy-ion collision simulators. We consider other conventional statistical models, none of which can reproduce the magnitude and centrality dependence of the correlations. The data can be reproduced by coherent emission from domains which grow in number and volume with increasing centrality. We study the dynamical evolution of the strange quark condensate and show that the energy released during the expansion and cooling of the system may be sufficient to explain the anomaly.</description>

      <title>Impact of local CP-odd domain in hot QCD on axionic domain-wall interpretation for NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the axionic domain-wall with a QCD bias may be incompatible with the NANOGrav 15-year data on a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, when the domain wall network collapses in the hot-QCD induced local CP-odd domain. This is due to the drastic suppression of the QCD bias set by the QCD topological susceptibility in the presence of the CP-odd domain with nonzero $\theta$ parameter of order one which the QCD sphaleron could generate. We quantify the effect on the GW signals by working on a low-energy effective model of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type in the mean field approximation. We find that only at $\theta=\pi$, the QCD bias tends to get significantly large enough due to the criticality of the thermal CP restoration, which would, however, give too big signal strengths to be consistent with the NANOGrav 15-year data and would also be subject to the strength of the phase transition at the criticality.</description>

      <title>Resolving the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with neutrino mass and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is to allow relic neutrinos to have non-zero degeneracy. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi_3$ as additional parameters, with the \textit{Planck} TT, lowT, plik--lensing, BAO, and DES datasets, and we observe a strong preference (Bayes factor $\log_{10}B=1.9$) for it over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are resolved to within 1$\sigma$ with the same set of neutrino parameters, along with 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M_\nu=0.58^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\ \mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi_3=1.27^{+0.42}_{-0.22}$). Furthermore, our analysis favors the scalar index $n_s$ to be slightly larger than 1, compatible with some hybrid inflation models, as well as a significantly larger optical depth $\tau$ than the standard Planck value, indicating an earlier onset of reionization.</description>

Abstract: LHCb has observed giant CP violation in localized regions of the Dalitz plots of B to three charmless light mesons. This has been interpreted as an enhancement due to strong two-body final state interactions. In this talk, we show how such interactions, described with dispersive analyses of data, can be implemented beyond the leading order expansion in the two-body re-scattering amplitude.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of nonlinear energy density waves in a nonextensive quark-gluon plasma under the influence of a magnetic field using the reductive perturbation technique. For a nonextensive MIT bag equation of state, we obtain the governing equation for the first order perturbation of the energy density. We observe that an increase in the strength of the magnetic field results in the localization of the waves.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Form Factors and Mechanical Properties of Quarks in Protons: A Basis Light-Front Quantization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors (GFFs) and study their applications for the description of the mechanical properties such as the pressure, shear force distributions, and the mechanical radius of the proton from its light-front wave functions (LFWFs) based on basis light-front quantization (BLFQ). The LFWFs of the proton are given by the lowest eigenvector of a light-front effective Hamiltonian that incorporates a three-dimensional confining potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling between the constituent quarks solved in the valence Fock sector. We find acceptable agreement between our BLFQ computations and the lattice QCD for the GFFs. Our $D$-term form factor also agrees well with the extracted data from the deeply virtual Compton scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab, and the results of different phenomenological models. The distributions of pressures and shear forces are similar to those from different models.</description>

      <title>Combination and Reinterpretation of LHC SUSY Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maximise the information obtained from various independent new physics searches conducted at the LHC, it is imperative to consider the combination of multiple analyses. To showcase the exclusion power gained by combining signal regions from different searches, we consider a simplified scenario inspired by supersymmetry, with all particles but one squark flavour and a bino-like neutralino decoupled. The corresponding signal therefore comprises strong squark pair production, associated squark-neutralino production, as well as weak neutralino pair production. We find that considering the associated and strong production mechanisms together significantly impacts mass limits, while contributions from the weak production are insignificant in the context of current exclusion limits. In addition, we demonstrate that the combination of uncorrelated signal regions as assessed from the recent TACO approach substantially pushes exclusion limits towards higher masses, relative to the bounds derived from the most sensitive individual analyses.</description>

      <title>CapsLorentzNet: Integrating Physics Inspired Features with Graph Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of advanced machine learning techniques, boosted object tagging has witnessed significant progress. In this article, we take this field further by introducing novel architectural modifications compatible with a wide array of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. Our approach advocates for integrating capsule layers, replacing the conventional decoding blocks in standard GNNs. These capsules are a group of neurons with vector activations. The orientation of these vectors represents important properties of the objects under study, with their magnitude characterizing whether the object under study belongs to the class represented by the capsule. Moreover, capsule networks incorporate a regularization by reconstruction mechanism, facilitating the seamless integration of expert-designed high-level features into the analysis. We have studied the usefulness of our architecture with the LorentzNet architecture for quark-gluon tagging. Here, we have replaced the decoding block of LorentzNet with a capsulated decoding block and have called the resulting architecture CapsLorentzNet. Our new architecture can enhance the performance of LorentzNet by 20 \% for the quark-gluon tagging task.</description>

      <title>Collider imprint of vector-like leptons in light of anomalous magnetic moment and neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of incorporating anomaly-free representations of vector-like leptons into the Standard Model, aiming to address longstanding puzzles related to the anomalous magnetic moments of the muon and electron while maintaining consistency with neutrino masses and mixings. We find that among the various representations of vector-like leptons permitted by the Standard Model gauge symmetry, only weak doublets and singlets offer satisfactory solutions, all associated with a significantly constrained parameter space. Our analysis delves into the associated parameter space, identifying representative benchmark scenarios suitable for collider studies. These setups yield a distinctive six-lepton signature whose associated signals can easily be distinguished from the Standard Model background, providing a clear signal indicative of new physics models featuring vector-like leptons. Our work hence sheds light on the potential implications of vector-like leptons in resolving discrepancies inherent to the Standard Model, while also offering insights into experimental avenues for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Isotropization of a longitudinally expanding system of scalar fields in the 2PI formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by isotropization of QCD matter in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions, we consider a system of scalar fields that undergoes a boost invariant longitudinal expansion. We use the framework of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action, which is close to the underlying quantum field theory, and resum self-energy corrections up to three loops. The resulting 2PI equations of motion are expressed in terms of the Milne coordinates to account for longitudinal expansion. By solving numerically these equations of motion, we can extract the occupation density and the effective mass generated by in-medium interactions. At the largest values of the coupling considered in this study, we observe the onset of isotropization both in the occupation number and in the momentum dependence of the effective mass.</description>

      <title>High-energy physics image classification: A Survey of Jet Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent times, the fields of high-energy physics (HEP) experimentation and phenomenological studies have seen the integration of machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This survey offers a comprehensive assessment of these applications within the realm of various DL approaches. The initial segment of the paper introduces the fundamentals encompassing diverse particle physics types and establishes criteria for evaluating particle physics in tandem with learning models. Following this, a comprehensive taxonomy is presented for representing HEP images, encompassing accessible datasets, intricate details of preprocessing techniques, and methods of feature extraction and selection. Subsequently, the focus shifts to an exploration of available artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to HEP images, along with a concentrated examination of HEP image classification pertaining to Jet particles. Within this review, a profound investigation is undertaken into distinct ML and DL proposed state-of-the art (SOTA) techniques, underscoring their implications for HEP inquiries. The discussion delves into specific applications in substantial detail, including Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The survey culminates with an analysis concerning the present status of HEP grounded in DL methodologies, encompassing inherent challenges and prospective avenues for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Strongly-ordered infrared counterterms from factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of infrared subtraction algorithms beyond next-to-leading order, it becomes necessary to consider multiple infrared limits of scattering amplitudes, in which several particles become soft or collinear in a strongly-ordered sequence. We study these limits from the point of view of infrared factorisation, and we provide general definitions of strongly-ordered soft and collinear kernels in terms of gauge-invariant operator matrix elements. With these definitions in hand, it is possible to construct local subtraction counterterms for strongly-ordered configurations. Because of their factorised structure, these counterterms cancel infrared poles of real-virtual contributions by construction. We test these ideas at tree level for multiple emissions, and at one loop for single and double emissions, contributing to NNLO and N3LO distributions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

Abstract: Thermal QCD systems like strongly coupled QGP require not only a large 't-Hooft coupling but also a finite gauge coupling arXiv:hep-ph/0701201. Unlike almost all top-down holographic models in the literature, holographic large-$N$ thermal QCD models based on this assumption, therefore necessarily require addressing this limit from ${\cal M}$ theory. In the context of strongly coupled (very large `t-Hooft coupling), bulk viscosity $\zeta$ of the type IIA-theory dual of thermal QCD-like theories was found to vary like $\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2$ arXiv:1807.04713 ($c_s$ being the speed of sound), and the same at weak coupling using kinetic theory and finite temperature field theory, was shown in arXiv:1807.04713 to vary like $\left(\frac{1}{3} - c_s^2\right)^2$. In this paper, we not only show that at intermediate coupling, $\zeta$ varies like a linear combination of the strong and weak coupling results, but also observe that this behavior is related to the existence of Contact 3-Structures that exists only at intermediate coupling effected by the intermediate-$N$ "MQGP" limit arXiv:2211.13186.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <title>Simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simulations of stochastic fluid dynamics in the vicinity of a critical endpoint belonging to the universality class of the Ising model. This study is motivated by the challenge of modeling the dynamics of critical fluctuations near a conjectured critical endpoint in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). We focus on the interaction of shear modes with a conserved scalar density, which is known as model H. We show that the observed dynamical scaling behavior depends on the correlation length and the shear viscosity of the fluid. As the correlation length is increased or the viscosity is decreased we observe a cross-over from the dynamical exponent of critical diffusion, $z\simeq 4$, to the expected scaling exponent of model H, $z\simeq 3$. We use our method to investigate time-dependent correlation function of non-Gaussian moments $M^n(t)$ of the order parameter. We find that the relaxation time depends in non-trivial manner on the power $n$.</description>

      <title>With a Little Help from Photons: Quantum Field Theory on Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Mode Recombination Formula and Nonanalytic Term in Effective Potential at Finite Temperature on Compactified Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new formula called a mode recombination formula, and we can recast the effective potential at finite temperature in one-loop approximation for fermion and scalar fields on the $D$-dimensional spacetime, $S_{\tau}^1\times R^{D-(p+1)}\times \prod_{i=1}^pS_i^1$ into a convenient form for discussing nonanalytic terms, which cannot be written in the form of any positive integer power of the field-dependent mass squared, in the effective potential. The formula holds irrespective of whether the field is a fermion or a scalar and of boundary conditions for spacial $S_i^1$ directions and clarifies the importance of zero modes in the Kaluza-Klein modes for the existence of the nonanalytic terms. The effective potential is drastically simplified further to obtain the nonanalytic terms in easier and more transparent way. In addition to reproducing previous results, we find that there exists no nonanalytic term for the fermion field with arbitrary boundary condition for the spacial $S_i^1$ direction, which is also the case for the scalar field with the antiperiodic boundary condition for the spacial direction.</description>

      <title>Test of lepton universality and measurement of the form factors of $D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a first study of the semileptonic decay $D^0\rightarrow K^-\pi^0\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$ by analyzing an $e^+e^-$ annihilation data sample of $7.9~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at the center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector. The absolute branching fraction of $D^0\to K^-\pi^0\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}$ is measured for the first time to be $(0.729 \pm 0.014_{\rm stat} \pm 0.011_{\rm syst})\%$. Based on an amplitude analysis, the $S\text{-}{\rm wave}$ contribution is determined to be $(5.76 \pm 0.35_{\rm stat} \pm 0.29_{\rm syst})\%$ of the total decay rate in addition to the dominated $K^{*}(892)^-$ component. The branching fraction of $D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$ is given to be $(2.062 \pm 0.039_{\rm stat} \pm 0.032_{\rm syst})\%$, which improves the precision of the world average by a factor of 5. Combining with the world average of ${\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-e^+\nu_e)$, the ratio of the branching fractions obtained is $\frac{{\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-\mu^+\nu_\mu)}{{\mathcal B}(D^0\to K^{*}(892)^-e^+\nu_e)} = 0.96\pm0.08$, in agreement with lepton flavor universality. Furthermore, assuming single-pole dominance parameterization, the most precise hadronic form factor ratios for $D^0\to K^{*}(892)^{-} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are extracted to be $r_{V}=V(0)/A_1(0)=1.37 \pm 0.09_{\rm stat} \pm 0.03_{\rm syst}$ and $r_{2}=A_2(0)/A_1(0)=0.76 \pm 0.06_{\rm stat} \pm 0.02_{\rm syst}$.</description>

      <title>Probing multi-particle bunching from intermittency analysis in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that intermittency, a self-similar correlation regarding the size of the phase space volume, exhibits sensitivity to particle bunching within a system situated in the two-dimensional cell. Based on recent findings concerning fluctuations in charge particle density observed in central Au + Au collisions at various energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV at RHIC/STAR, it is proposed that analyzing intermittency in relativistic heavy-ion collisions could serve as a method to investigate density fluctuations linked to correlation phenomena. Our understanding of particle production mechanisms may be enriched by using intermittency analysis to gain new information contained in them that was previously unavailable.</description>

      <title>Tidal Formation of dark matter deficit diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 by SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations have revealed a significant dark matter deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 (DF2). It is widely accepted that the formation of this unique galaxy can be attributed to the tidal stripping of its host galaxy, NGC1052. In this study, we simulate the evolution of a satellite system containing globular clusters (GCs) within an accreting host halo in the framework of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). Our simulation results suggest that the heightened tidal stripping resulting from self-interaction can give rise to the transformation of a conventional dwarf galaxy into a galaxy resembling DF2 in all its observed properties. By comparing the simulation results with identical initial conditions in both the standard cold dark matter (CDM) and SIDM models, we find that the latter is more likely to replicate the properties of DF2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a DF2 analog can also be produced on an orbit with a greater pericenter distance by increasing the strength of self-interaction. This suggests that the issue of extreme orbital parameters can be mitigated by implementing the SIDM model. The distributions of the GC population derived in our SIDM simulation are consistent with the observed characteristics of DF2. For comparison, we also explored the potential for achieving GC distributions in the context of CDM.</description>

      <title>Connecting 2-Forms, Conformal Transformations, Curvature Invariants and Topological Classes in Einstein Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique Nature of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is the root cause of the many remarkable properties of the Einstein spacetimes, in particular their operational structure on the 2-forms. We show how this operational structure can be used for two ends. First, it allows for a simple generalization of the Birkhoff theorem to Schwarzschild (A)de-Sitter spacetime. Second, it provides the means to construct an Abelian endomorphism group on the space of 2-forms. It is observed that taking the trace over this group element-wise induces a further Abelian group which may be identified with a tensor representation of conformal transformations, giving Einstein spacetimes access to their own conformal equivalence class. A further trace over the group yields the curvature invariants of the spacetime. The Kretschmann scalar becomes the topological Euler density, which may be linked in a simple way to the Hawking temperature of horizons.</description>

      <title>Detecting superfluid transition in the pulsar core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is believed that the core of a neutron star can be host to various novel phases of matter, from nucleon superfluid phase to exotic high baryon density QCD phases. Different observational signals for such phase transitions have been discussed in the literature. Here, we point out a unique phenomenon associated with phase transition to a superfluid phase, which may be the nucleon superfluid phase or a phase like the CFL phase, allowing for superfluid vortices. In any superfluid phase transition, a random network of vortices forms via the so-called Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which eventually mostly decays away, finally leaving primarily vortices arising from the initial angular momentum of the core. This transient, random vortex network can have a non-zero net angular momentum for the superfluid component, which will generally be oriented in an arbitrary direction. This is in contrast to the final vortices, which arise from initial rotation and hence have the initial angular momentum of the neutron star. The angular momentum of the random vortex network is balanced by an equal and opposite angular momentum in the normal fluid due to the conservation of angular momentum, thereby imparting an arbitrarily oriented angular momentum component to the outer shell of the neutron star. This will affect the pulse timing and pulse profile of a pulsar. These changes in the pulses will decay away in a characteristic manner as the random vortex network decays, obeying specific scaling laws leading to universal features for the detection of superfluid transitions occurring in a pulsar core.</description>

      <title>On the weak and strong field effects in antiscalar background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triumph of general relativity under the banner "gravity is geometry" began with confirming the crucial effects within the Solar system and proceeded recently to the strong-field shadow effect for the compact object in the center of the Milky Way. Here, we examine some of those phenomena for the Einstein-scalar equations in the antiscalar regime to reveal the difference from vacuum both in weak and strong fields. As a result, we find that for week-field perihelion shift the difference between vacuum and antiscalar cases proves to be observationally imperceptible in practice, even for S-cluster stars with high eccentricities, and even if accumulated over a century. In strong-field case, we reconsider the shadow effect (this time without involving complex-valued scalar field) as the most perspective from an observational viewpoint. Even though the resulting difference is quite appreciable (about 5%), no conclusion can be made until the mass of the central object is known with the accuracy an order of magnitude higher than the currently available.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD estimates of thermal photon production from the QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal photons produced in heavy-ion collision experiments are an important observable for understanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The thermal photon rate from the QGP at a given temperature can be calculated from the spectral function of the vector current correlator. Extraction of the spectral function from the lattice correlator is known to be an ill-conditioned problem, as there is no unique solution for a spectral function for a given lattice correlator with statistical errors. The vector current correlator, on the other hand, receives a large ultraviolet contribution from the vacuum, which makes the extraction of the thermal photon rate difficult from this channel. We therefore consider the difference between the transverse and longitudinal part of the spectral function, only capturing the thermal contribution to the current correlator, simplifying the reconstruction significantly. The lattice correlator is calculated for light quarks in quenched QCD at $T=470~$MeV ($\sim 1.5\, T_c$), as well as in 2+1 flavor QCD at $T=220~$MeV ($\sim 1.2 \, T_{pc}$) with $m_{\pi}=320$ MeV. In order to quantify the non-perturbative effects, the lattice correlator is compared with the corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{LPM}^{\text{LO}}$ estimate of correlator. The reconstruction of the spectral function is performed in several different frameworks, ranging from physics-informed models of the spectral function to more general models in the Backus-Gilbert method and Gaussian Process regression. We find that the resulting photon rates agree within errors.</description>

Combining the CR measurements by AMS-02 and DAMPE in space and that by LHAASO and Auger on the ground we construct a model to recover all these measurements from tens of GeV to tens of EeV. We find the LHAASO measurement is crucial in the model construction by connecting the Galactic component to the extragalactic component. The precise measurements of CR spectra for individual species by AMS-02 and DAMPE together with the newest LHAASO results clearly indicates three Galactic CR components, that is, a soft low energy background, a hard high energy component, and a local source contribution. However, the LHAASO data show that above $\sim 10^{16}$ eV a nonnegligible extragalactic component must be included. Combining the Auger results and the LHAASO results we figure out the extragalactic CRs which need at least two components at lower and higher energies. Thanks to the precise measurements by LHAASO the constraints on the model parameters are quite stringent. The spectra features and mass measurements in all energy range are all well reproduced in the model.</description>

      <title>Form factor for Dalitz decays from $J/\psi$ to light pseudoscalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the form factor $M(q^2)$ for the Dalitz decay $J/\psi\to \gamma^*(q^2)\eta_{(N_f=1)}$ with $\eta_{(N_f)}$ being the SU($N_f$) flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson. The difference among the partial widths $\Gamma(J/\psi\to \gamma \eta_{(N_f)})$ at different $N_f$ can be attributed in part to the $\mathbf{U}_A(1)$ anomaly that induces a $N_f$ scaling. $M(q^2)$'s in $N_f=1,2$ are both well described by the single pole model $M(q^2)=M(0)/(1-q^2/\Lambda^2)$. Combined with the known experimental results of the Dalitz decays $J/\psi\to Pe^+e^-$, the pseudoscalar mass $m_P$ dependence of the pole parameter $\Lambda$ is approximated by $\Lambda(m_P^2)=\Lambda_1(1-m_P^2/\Lambda_2^2)$ with $\Lambda_1=2.64(4)~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\Lambda_2=2.97(33)~\mathrm{GeV}$. These results provide inputs for future theoretical and experimental studies on the Dalitz decays $J/\psi\to Pe^+e^-$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the effect of lens mass models in cosmological applications of strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lens system catalogues are typically used to constrain a combination of cosmological and empirical lens mass model parameters, even though the simplest singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models yield a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom $\simeq 2$. To date, this problem has been alleviated by introducing additional empirical parameters in the extended power law (EPL) models and constraints from high resolution imagery. The EPL parameters are taken to vary from lens to lens, rather than defining universal lens profiles. We investigate these lens models using Bayesian methods through a novel alternative that treats spatial curvature via the non-FLRW Timescape cosmology. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using the catalogue of 161 lens systems of Chen et al (arXiv:1809.09845) to simulate large mock catalogues for: (i) the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with zero spatial curvature; and (ii) the Timescape model. Furthermore, this methodology can be applied to any cosmological model. In agreement with previous results we find that in combination with SIS parameters, models with zero FLRW spatial curvature fit better as the free parameter approaches an unphysical empty universe, $\Omega_{\rm M0}\to0$. By contrast, the Timescape cosmology is found to prefer parameter values in which its cosmological parameter, the present void fraction, is driven to $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73$ matches, close to values found to best fit independent cosmological data sets: supernovae Ia distances and cosmic microwave background. This conclusion holds for a large range of seed values $f_{\rm v0}\to0.73\in\{0.1,0.9\}$, and for Timescape fits to both Timescape and FLRW mocks. Regardless of cosmology, unphysical estimates of the distance ratios given from power-law lens models result in poor goodness of fit. Nonetheless, the results are consistent with non-FLRW spatial curvature evolution.</description>

Abstract: Coherence violation is an interesting and counter-intuitive phenomenon in QCD. We discuss the circumstances under which violation occurs in observables sensitive to soft radiation and arrive at the conclusion that almost all such observables at hadron colliders will violate coherence to some degree. We illustrate our discussion by considering the gaps-between-jets observable, where coherence violation is super-leading, then we generalise to other observables, including precise statements on the logarithmic order of coherence violation.</description>

Abstract: Modern machine learning is transforming particle physics fast, bullying its way into our numerical tool box. For young researchers it is crucial to stay on top of this development, which means applying cutting-edge methods and tools to the full range of LHC physics problems. These lecture notes lead students with basic knowledge of particle physics and significant enthusiasm for machine learning to relevant applications. They start with an LHC-specific motivation and a non-standard introduction to neural networks and then cover classification, unsupervised classification, generative networks, and inverse problems. Two themes defining much of the discussion are well-defined loss functions and uncertainty-aware networks. As part of the applications, the notes include some aspects of theoretical LHC physics. All examples are chosen from particle physics publications of the last few years.</description>

      <title>The Supercooling Window at Weak and Strong Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercooled first order phase transitions are typical of theories where conformal symmetry is predominantly spontaneously broken. In these theories the fate of the flat scalar direction is highly sensitive to the size and the scaling dimension of the explicit breaking deformations. For a given deformation, the coupling must lie in a particular region to realize a supercooled first order phase transition. We identify the supercooling window in weakly coupled theories and derive a fully analytical understanding of its boundaries. Mapping these boundaries allows us to identify the deformations enlarging the supercooling window and to characterize their dynamics analytically. For completeness we also discuss strongly coupled conformal field theories with an holographic dual, where the complete characterization of the supercooling window is challenged by calculability issues.</description>

Abstract: The $x$ dependence of hadrons' generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $\mathcal{F}(x,\xi,t)$ is the most difficult to extract from the existing known processes, while the $\xi$ and $t$ dependence are uniquely determined by the kinematics of the scattered hadron. We study the single diffractive hard exclusive processes for extracting GPDs in the photoproduction. We demonstrate quantitatively the enhanced sensitivity on extracting the $x$ dependence of various GPDs from the photoproduction cross sections, as well as the asymmetries constructed from photon polarization and hadron spin that could be measured at JLab Hall D by GlueX Collaboration and future facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of non-thermal dark matter (DM), $\chi$, during post-inflationary reheating era. For inflation, we consider two slow roll single field inflationary scenarios - generalized version of Hilltop (GH) inflation, and Coleman-Weinberg (CW) inflation. Using a set of benchmark values that comply with the current constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) data for each inflationary model, we explored the parameter space involving mass of dark matter particles, $m_\chi$, and coupling between inflaton and $\chi$, $y_\chi$. For these benchmarks, we find that tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be as small as $2.69\times 10^{-6}$ for GH and $1.91\times 10^{-3}$ for CW inflation, both well inside $1-\sigma$ contour on scalar spectral index versus $r$ plane from Planck2018+BICEP3+KeckArray2018 dataset, and testable by future cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations e.g. Simons Observatory. For the production of $\chi$ from the inflaton decay satisfying CMB and other cosmological bounds and successfully explaining total cold dark matter density of the present universe, we find that $y_\chi$ should be within this range ${\cal O}\left(10^{-4}\right) \gtrsim y_\chi\gtrsim {\cal O}\left(10^{-20}\right)$ for both inflationary scenarios. We also show that, even for the same inflationary scenario, the allowed parameter space on reheating temperature versus $m_\chi$ plane alters with inflationary parameters including scalar spectral index, $r$, and energy scale of inflation.</description>

Focusing on long-distance contributions driven by the lowest-lying hadronic intermediate states, we work out the correlations between these beyond-the-Standard-Model signals and the Dalitz-plot asymmetries in $\eta \rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\eta' \rightarrow \eta \pi^+ \pi^- $, using dispersion theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigate neutrino magnetic moment, triplet scalar dark matter in a Type-II radiative seesaw scenario. With three vector-like fermion doublets and two scalar triplets, we provide a loop level setup for the electromagnetic vertex of neutrinos. All the scalar multiplet components constitute the total dark matter abundance of the Universe and also their scattering cross section with detector lie below the experimental upper limit. Using the consistent parameter space in dark matter domain, we obtain light neutrino mass in sub-eV scale and also magnetic moment in the desired range. We further derive the constraints on neutrino transition magnetic moments, consistent with XENONnT limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the QCD instanton vacuum model to discuss the emergence of the light scalar and vector mesons on the light front. We take into account both the instanton and anti-instanton single and molecular interactions on the light quarks, in the form of non-local effective interactions. Although the molecular induced interactions are suppressed by a power of the packing fraction, they are still sufficient to bind the vector mesons, while keeping most of the scalar spectrum relatively unchanged. We explicitly derive the light front distribution amplitudes (DAs) and partonic functions (PDFs) for the scalar and vector mesons, and compare them after pertinent QCD evolution, to the available empirical and lattice measured counterparts. The Dirac electric form factors for both the pion and rho meson are derived, and shown to compare well with current data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the inelastic signatures of dark matter-nucleus interactions, explicitly focusing on the ramifications of polarization, dark matter splitting, and the Migdal effect. Direct detection experiments, crucial for testing the existence of dark matter, encounter formidable obstacles such as indomitable neutrino backgrounds and the elusive determination of dark matter spin. To overcome these challenges, we explore the potential of polarized-target dark matter scattering, examining the impact of nonvanishing mass splitting and the role of the Migdal effect in detecting light dark matter. Our analysis demonstrates the valuable utility of the polarized triple-differential event rate as an effective tool for studying inelastic dark matter. It enables us to investigate both angular and energy dependencies, providing valuable insights into the scattering process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) signature in the doublet left-right symmetric model (DLRSM) resulting from the strong first-order phase transition (SFOPT) associated with $SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$-breaking. For different values of the symmetry-breaking scale $v_R =20,~30$, and $50$ TeV, we construct the one-loop finite temperature effective potential to explore the parameter space for regions showing SFOPT. We identify the region where the associated stochastic GW background is strong enough to be detected at planned GW observatories. A strong GW background favors a relatively light neutral CP-even scalar $H_{3}$, arising from the $SU(2)_R$ doublet. The $SU(2)_L$ subgroup of DLRSM is broken by three vevs: $\kappa_1,~\kappa_2$, and $v_L$. We observe a preference for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ values of the ratio $w=v_L/\kappa_1$, but no clear preference for the ratio $r=\kappa_2/\kappa_1$. A large number of points with strong GW background can be ruled out from precise measurement of the trilinear Higgs coupling and searches for $H_3$ at future colliders.</description>

Abstract: Various conventional running coupling prescriptions reproducing $\beta_ 0$-dependent terms of NLO JIMWLK are reviewed and found to be theoretically inconsistent: the JIMWLK evolution Hamiltonian with running coupling violates the requirement of positive semidefiniteness. This requirement appears to be tightly related to the possibility of having a Langevin formulation for the evolution. We also review the scheme that attributes a part of $\beta_0$-dependent terms to the DGLAP evolution of the projectile. The remaining $\beta_0$-dependent contributions sum up into so-called the ``daughter dipole'' prescription, which leads to a manifestly positive semidefinite Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A cosmological sandwiched window for lepton-number breaking scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A singlet majoron can arise from the seesaw framework as a pseudo-Goldstone boson when the heavy Majorana neutrinos acquire masses via the spontaneous breaking of global ${\rm U}(1)_L$ symmetry. The resulting cosmological impacts are usually derived from the effective majoron-neutrino interaction, and the majoron abundance is accumulated through the freeze-in neutrino coalescence. However, a primordial majoron abundance can be predicted in a minimal setup and lead to distinctive cosmological effects. In this work, we consider such a primordial majoron abundance from relativistic freeze-out and calculate the modification to the effective neutrino number $N_{\rm eff}$. We demonstrate that the measurements of $N_{\rm eff}$ will constrain the parameter space from a primordial majoron abundance in an opposite direction to that from neutrino coalescence. When the contributions from both the primordial abundance and the freeze-in production coexist, the ${\rm U}(1)_L$-breaking scale (seesaw scale) $f$ will be pushed into a ''sandwiched window''. Remarkably, for majoron masses below 1 MeV and above the eV scale, the future CMB-S4 experiment will completely close such a low-scale seesaw window for $f\in [1,10^5]~{\rm GeV}$. We highlight that any new light particle with a primordial abundance that couples to SM particles may lead to a similar sandwiched window, and such a general phenomenon deserves careful investigation.</description>

      <title>On the criterion of perturbativity with the mass-dependent beta function in extended Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to realize electroweak first order phase transition, a category of extended Higgs models with relatively large self-coupling constants is often considered. In such a scenario, the running coupling constants can blow up at an energy scale much below the Planck scale. To clarify the allowed parameter space of the model, it is important to evaluate the scale where perturbation calculation breaks down. In the renormalization group equation analysis using the mass-independent renormalization scheme, we need the matching condition to connect the low energy theory and the high energy theory. Consequently, the analysis depends on the detail of the matching condition. On the other hand, the analysis with the mass-dependent beta function is performed in a simpler way, because the threshold effect is automatically included in the beta function. Therefore, in this paper, using the mass-dependent beta function at the one-loop level, we discuss the application limit of perturbation calculation. First, in a toy model with two complex scalar fields, we explain the essence of our method and compare our results with those based on the mass-independent beta function. We then apply our method to the more realistic model; i.e., the inert doublet model. We find that in our method, in which the threshold effect is automatically included, the energy scale where the perturbation calculation breaks down can be higher than the one using the mass-independent beta function, especially when the blow up scale is relatively low.</description>

      <title>Functional Matching and Renormalization Group Equations at Two-Loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for determining the two-loop effective Lagrangian resulting from integrating out a set of heavy particles in an ultraviolet scalar theory. We prove that the matching coefficients are entirely determined from the (double-)hard region of the loop integrals and present a master formula for matching, applicable to both diagrammatic and functional approaches. We further employ functional methods to determine compact expressions for the effective Lagrangian that do not rely on any previous knowledge of its structure or symmetries. The same methods are also applicable to the computation of renormalization group equations. We demonstrate the application of the functional approach by computing the two-loop matching coefficients and renormalization group equations in a scalar toy model.</description>

      <title>Semirelativistic study on the semileptonic decays of $B_q$ mesons to orbital excited heavy Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the method of solving the complete Salpeter equation, we study the semileptonic decays of a $0^-$ heavy meson to $1P$, $2P$, or $3P$ heavy tensor mesons, $B_q \to (\bar c q)(nP) \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ $(q=u,d,s,c;n=1,2,3)$. The obtained branching ratio of $\mathcal{B} (B \rightarrow D_2^{\star}(2460)\ell^{+} \nu_{\ell})$ agrees with the experimental data. We predict $\mathcal{B}\left(B_s^{0} \rightarrow D_{s2}^{\star-}(1P) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}\right)$$=$$3.76\times 10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}\left(B_c^+ \rightarrow \chi_{c2}(1P)\ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}\right)$$=$$1.82\times 10^{-3}$. The branching ratios of decays to $2P$ and $3P$ final states are found to be very small. The ratios $\mathcal{R}(\bar{D}_{2}^{\star 0})=0.045$, $\mathcal{R}({D}_{s2}^{\star})=0.048$ and $\mathcal{R}({\chi}_{c2})=0.059$ are also obtained. This study focuses on the contribution of relativistic corrections. The wave function of the pseudoscalar includes non-relativistic $S$-wave and relativistic $P$-wave. While for a tensor, it contains non-relativistic $P$-wave and relativistic $P$, $D$ and $F$ waves in its wave function. We find the individual contributions of relativistic partial waves are significant in the decay $B \to D_2^{\star }(2460)\ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}$, but the overall contribution of the relativistic effect is $24.4\%$, which is small due to cancellation. Similarly, for the decay $B_s^{0} \rightarrow D_{s2}^{\star-}(1P) \ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}$, the contribution of the relativistic effect is $28.8\%$. While for $B_c^+ \rightarrow \chi_{c2}(1P)\ell^{+} \nu_{\ell}$, the individual contributions of relativistic partial waves and the overall relativistic correction are both small, the later of which is $22.1\%$.</description>

Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature.
  As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition point.</description>

      <title>Productions of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ in $B_{(s)}$ and $\Lambda_b(\Xi_b)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show that $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ contain large molecular components. In this work, we employ the naive factorization approach to calculate the production rates of $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ as hadronic molecules in $B_{(s)}$ and $\Lambda_b(\Xi_b)$ decays, where their decay constants are estimated in the effective Lagrangian approach. With the so-obtained decay constants $f_{D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)}$ and $f_{D_{s1}(2460)}$, we calculate the branching fractions of the $b$-meson decays $B_{(s)}\to \bar{D}_{(s)}^{(*)}D_{s0}^*$ and $B_{(s)}\to \bar{D}_{(s)}^{(*)}D_{s1}$ and the $b$-baryon decays $\Lambda_b(\Xi_{b}) \to \Lambda_c(\Xi_{c}) D_{s0}^*$ and $\Lambda_b(\Xi_{b}) \to \Lambda_c(\Xi_c) D_{s1}$. Our results show that the production rates of $D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ in the $B_s$, $\Lambda_b$ and $\Xi_b$ decays are rather large that future experiments could observe them. In particular, we demonstrate that one can extract the decay constants of hadronic molecules via the triangle mechanism because of the equivalence of the triangle mechanism to the tree diagram established in calculating the decays $B \to \bar{D}^{(*)}D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)$ and $B \to \bar{D}^{(*)}D_{s1}(2460)$.</description>

Abstract: Discrete family symmetry models based on the $Z_3$ symmetry of ``lepton triality'' were recently studied in the context of charged-lepton flavour-violating processes at Belle II and the proposed $\mu^+ \mu^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ collider known as $\mu$TRISTAN. In this paper we augment these phenomenological analyses to include the $Z$ and Higgs boson decays $Z \to \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($\ell = e, \mu, \tau$), $H \to \gamma \gamma$ and $H \to Z \gamma$ that are induced at the $1$-loop level in these models. We also derive the parameter space that will be probed by the HL-LHC and the possible future colliders the ILC, CEPC and FCC.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events and Dark Matter Scatterings with Neutrinos and Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars can be tidally disrupted when passing near a black hole, and the debris can induce a flux of high-energy neutrinos. It has been discussed that there are hints in IceCube data of high-energy neutrinos produced in Tidal Disruption Events. The emitting region of neutrinos and photons in these astrophysical events is likely to be located in the vicinity of the central black hole, where the dark matter density might be significantly larger than in the outer regions of the galaxy. We explore the potential attenuation of the emitted neutrino and photon fluxes due to interactions with dark matter particles around the supermassive black hole of the host galaxies of AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr and AT2019aalc, and study the implications for some well-motivated models of dark matter-neutrino and dark matter-photon interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the complementarity of our constraints with values of the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section proven to alleviate some cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Imprints of light dark matter on the evolution of cosmic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are often considered as a portal to new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) and might possess phenomenologically interesting interactions with dark matter (DM). This paper examines the cosmological imprints of DM that interacts with and is produced from SM neutrinos at temperatures below the MeV scale. We take a model-independent approach to compute the evolution of DM in this framework and present analytic results which agree well with numerical ones. Both freeze-in and freeze-out regimes are included in our analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thermal evolution of neutrinos might be substantially affected by their interaction with DM. We highlight two distinctive imprints of such DM on neutrinos: (i) a large, negative contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$, which is close to the current experimental limits and will readily be probed by future experiments; (ii) spectral distortion of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) due to DM annihilating into neutrinos, a potentially important effect for the ongoing experimental efforts to detect C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Charged-current non-standard neutrino interactions at Daya Bay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02901v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full data set of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment is used to probe the effect of the charged current non-standard interactions (CC-NSI) on neutrino oscillation experiments. Two different approaches are applied and constraints on the corresponding CC-NSI parameters are obtained with the neutrino flux taken from the Huber-Mueller model with a $5\%$ uncertainty. For the quantum mechanics-based approach (QM-NSI), the constraints on the CC-NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\alpha}$ and $\epsilon_{e\alpha}^{s}$ are extracted with and without the assumption that the effects of the new physics are the same in the production and detection processes, respectively. The approach based on the effective field theory (EFT-NSI) deals with four types of CC-NSI represented by the parameters $[\varepsilon_{X}]_{e\alpha}$. For both approaches, the results for the CC-NSI parameters are shown for cases with various fixed values of the CC-NSI and the Dirac CP-violating phases, and when they are allowed to vary freely. We find that constraints on the QM-NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\alpha}$ and $\epsilon_{e\alpha}^{s}$ from the Daya Bay experiment alone can reach the order $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ for the former and $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the latter, while for EFT-NSI parameters $[\varepsilon_{X}]_{e\alpha}$, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for both cases.</description>

      <title>Single production of vectorlike quarks with charge 5/3 at the 14 TeV LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-like quarks have been predicted in many new physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM), which can have sizable couplings to first generation quarks without conflicting with current experimental constraints. In a framework of the SM simply extended by an SU(2) doublet $\left(X,T\right)$ including a vector-like quark $X$~(VLQ-$X$), with electric charge $|Q_{X}| = 5/3$, we investigate the single production of the VLQ-$X$ induced by the couplings between the VLQ-$X$ with the first and the third generation quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operating at $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV. The signal is searched in events including same-sign dileptons (electrons or muons), one $b$-tagged jet and missing energy, where the X quark is assumed to decay into a top quark and a W boson, both decaying leptonically. After a rapid simulation of signal and background events, the 95\% CL exclusion limits and the $5\sigma$ discovery reach are respectively obtained at the 14 TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Entropy and multifractality in ring-like and jet-like events produced in 11.6A GeV/c $^{197}$Au-AgBr collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical quantities such as, entropy, dimensions and multifractal characteristics of multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in $^{197}$Au-AgBr collisions are examined and the findings are compared with the predictions of Monte Carlo model URQMD (Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) and HIJING (Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator) and also with the results reported earlier in hadron-hadron and nucleus-nucleus collisions at different energies. Based on their azimuth distribution, the charged particles produced within narrow-bins exhibit two kinds of substructures, namely, ring-like and jet-like substructures. Thus, on applying the suitable criteria the two different types of events are identified and analyzed separately. It is observed that the maximum entropy production occurs around a narrow mid-rapidity region. The analyses of ring-like and jet-like events suggest that the entropy production is much larger in ring-like events as compared to that in jet-like events. Furthermore, Renyi's order-q information entropy is used to estimate the multifractal specific heat and to construct the spectrum of scaling indices. The findings reveal that the value of multifractal specific heat is higher in ring-like events as compared to that in jet-like events. The studies of generalized dimension and multifractal spectrum indicate that the multifractality is rather, more pronounced in ring-like events as compared to jet-like events. Various features of the experimental data are noticed to be nicely reproduced by the URQMD model</description>

      <title>Bubble Misalignment Mechanism for Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of axions at first-order phase transitions in non-Abelian gauge theories. When the duration of the phase transition is short compared to the timescale of the axion oscillations, the axion dynamics is similar to the trapped misalignment mechanism. On the other hand, if this is not the case, the axions are initially expelled from the inside of the bubbles, generating axion waves on the outside. Analogous to the Fermi acceleration, these axions gain energy by repeatedly scattering off the bubble walls. Once they acquire enough energy, they can enter the bubbles. The novel ``bubble misalignment mechanism'' can significantly enhance the axion abundance, compared to models where the axion mass is either constant or varies continuously as a function of temperature. The increase in axion abundance depends on the axion mass, the duration of the phase transition, and the bubble wall velocity. This mechanism results in a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of axions, which could lead to the formation of axion miniclusters. It has potential implications for the formation of oscillons/I-balls, axion warm dark matter, cosmic birefringence, and the production of dark photons.</description>

Abstract: By using the extrapolation method, a polarized Polykov-loop potential at finite real angular velocity is constructed from the lattice results at finite imaginary angular velocity. The chiral and deconfinement phase transitions under rotation have been simultaneously investigated in the Polarized-Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PPNJL) model. It is observed that both critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral phase transition increase with the angular velocity, which is in consistent with lattice results. The spin alignment of vector meson has the negative deviation of $\rho_{00} -1/3$ under rotation, and the deviation in the PPNJL model is much more significant than that in the NJL model and the quark coalescence model, which revealing the important role of rotating gluons on the quark polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied neutrino phenomenology in the supersymmetric type-I seesaw model endowed with the $\Gamma_2 \simeq S_3$ modular symmetry. We have identified different realizations of the $S_3$ modular symmetry, referred to as models A, B, C, and D. The 4 models are compatible with neutrino mass being inverted ordering (IO). Moreover, models A, B, and D can also accommodate normal ordering (NO) neutrino masses. We identify parameter space for each model compatible with neutrino oscillation at the 2-$\sigma$ level. We then proceed to study the neutrino phenomenology of each model. We find that the lightest neutrino mass can be as light as 0.64 meV in the case of NO in model A and 50 meV in the case of IO in model D. The smallest effective electron neutrino mass attainable in our analysis is 8.8 meV in the case of NO (model A), and 50 meV for IO (model D). Finally, we note that the effective Majorana mass can be as small as 0.33 meV in the case of NO (model A) and 22 meV for IO (model D).</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this study, 24.5 TeV CoM energy FCC-$\mu p$ and 20.2 TeV CoM energy SPPC-$\mu p$ muon-proton colliders have been utilized to explore the anomalous $ZZ\gamma$ and $Z\gamma\gamma$ couplings corresponding to dim-8 operators through the process of $\mu^- \gamma \to Z l^{-} \to l^{-} \tilde{\nu_{l}} \nu_{l}$. A cut-based method has been applied to enhance the signal background ratio in the analysis. Coupling limits, at a 95\% Confidence Level (C.L.), under the systematic uncertainties of 0\%, 3\%, and 5\%, were obtained with luminosities of ${\cal L}_{int}=5$ and 42.8 fb$^{-1}$ for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ colliders, respectively. The limits for anomalous $C_{BB}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{\tilde{B}W}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{WW}/\Lambda^{4}$, $C_{BW}/\Lambda^{4}$ couplings without systematic uncertainty for FCC-$\mu p$ and SPPC-$\mu p$ were found as follows, respectively: [0.06845; 0.070019967] TeV-4, [-0.18662; 0.18422] TeV-4, [-0.23623; 0.23815] TeV-4, [-0.61912; 0.62072] TeV-4, and [-0.06606; 0.05050] TeV-4, [-0.15791; 0.15126] TeV-4, [-0.20663; 0.19155] TeV-4, [-0.51383; 0.52211] TeV-4.</description>

Abstract: Physical systems which can be described by classical fields in classical theory, can also be described by quantum states in quantum field theory. We study the correspondence between the classical field and the quantum state which both describe the same physical systems. We derive the quantum states corresponding to the classical field in the representation expanded by the eigenstates of quantum field operators. This allows us to directly observe the spatial entanglement structure of quantum states and explore the differences and relationships between quantum superposition and classical superposition. We find that if two classical fields are identical in a certain spatial region, then their corresponding quantum states have the same reduced density matrix in that region. This indicates that knowing the classical field in a local region is sufficient to immediately derive the reduced density matrix for that region. According to the correspondence between classical observables and quantum states, we derive the equation of motion in classical theory from the evolution of quantum states in Yukawa theory. This leads to the relativistic classical Yukawa theory, and we further obtain relativistic corrections to the Yukawa potential.</description>

      <title>Putting Flat $\Lambda$CDM In The (Redshift) Bin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology is specified by two constant fitting parameters at the background level in the late Universe, the Hubble constant $H_0$ and matter density (today) $\Omega_m$. Mathematically, $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ are either integration constants arising from solving ordinary differential equations or are directly related to integration constants. Seen in this context, if fits of the $\Lambda$CDM model to cosmological probes at different redshifts lead to different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ parameters, this is a mismatch between mathematics and observation. Here, in mock observational Hubble data (OHD) (geometric probes of expansion history) we demonstrate evolution in distributions of best fit parameters with effective redshift. As a result, considerably different $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ best fits from Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cannot be precluded in high redshift bins. We explore if OHD, Type Ia supernovae and standardisable quasar samples exhibit redshift evolution of best fit $\Lambda$CDM parameters. In all samples, we confirm a decreasing $H_0$ and increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with increasing bin redshift. Through comparison with mocks, we confirm that similar behaviour can arise randomly within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with probabilities as low as $p = 0.0021$ ($3.1 \, \sigma$). We present complementary profile distribution analysis confirming the shifts in cosmological parameters in high redshift bins. In particular, we identify a redshift range where Planck $(H_0, \Omega_m)$ values are disfavoured at $99.6 \%$ ($2.9 \sigma$) confidence level in a combination of OHD and supernovae data.</description>

Abstract: The investigation of the phase state of dense matter is hindered by complications of first-principle nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics. By performing the first consistent general-relativistic calculations of tidal-excited g-mode of neutron stars with a first-order strong interaction phase transition in the high-density core, we demonstrate that gravitational wave signal during binary neutron star inspiral probes their innermost hadron-quark transition and provides potent constraints from present and future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Inverted Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the radial and non-radial oscillations of Cross stars (CrSs), i.e., stars with a quark matter crust and a hadronic matter core in an inverted order compared to conventional hybrid stars. We draw comparisons of their oscillation modes with those of neutron stars, quark stars, and conventional hybrid stars. We find that the stellar stability analysis from the fundamental mode of radial oscillations, and the $g$, $f$ modes of non-radial oscillations are quite similar to those of conventional hybrid stars. However, due to the inverted stellar structure, the first non-radial $p$ mode of CrSs behaves in an inverted way and sits in a higher frequency domain compared to that of conventional hybrid stars. These results provide a direct way to discriminate CrSs from other types of compact stars via gravitational-wave probes. Specifically, compact stars emitting $g$-mode gravitational waves within the $0.5$-$1$ kHz range should be CrSs or conventional hybrid stars rather than neutron stars or pure quark stars, and a further GW detection of the first $p$ mode above 8 kHz or an identification of a decreasing trend of frequencies versus star masses associated with it will help identify the compact object to be a CrS rather than a conventional hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Cosmological and idealized simulations of dark matter haloes with velocity-dependent, rare and frequent self-interactions</title>

Abstract: Dark matter self-interactions may have the capability to solve or at least mitigate small-scale problems of the cosmological standard model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter. There are a variety of self-interacting dark matter models that lead to distinguishable astrophysical predictions and hence varying success in explaining observations. Studies of dark matter (DM) density cores on various mass scales suggest a velocity-dependent scattering cross-section. In this work, we investigate how a velocity dependence alters the evolution of the DM distribution for frequent DM scatterings and compare to the velocity-independent case. We demonstrate that these cases are qualitatively different using a test problem. Moreover, we study the evolution of the density profile of idealized DM haloes and find that a velocity dependence can lead to larger core sizes and different time-scales of core formation and core collapse. In cosmological simulations, we investigate the effect of velocity-dependent self-interaction on haloes and satellites in the mass range of $\approx 10^{11} - 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. We study the abundance of satellites, density, and shape profiles and try to infer qualitative differences between velocity-dependent and velocity-independent scatterings as well as between frequent and rare self-interactions. We find that a strongly velocity-dependent cross-section can significantly amplify the diversity of rotation curves, independent of the angular dependence of the differential cross-section. We further find that the abundance of satellites in general depends on both the velocity dependence and the scattering angle, although the latter is less important for strongly velocity-dependent cross-sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous symmetries are known to strongly constrain the possible IR behavior along any renormalization group (RG) flow. Recently, the extension of the notion of symmetry in QFT has provided new types of anomalies with a corresponding new class of constraints on RG flows. In this paper, we derive the constraints imposed on RG flows from anomalies that can only be activated in the presence of specific background fluxes even though they do not necessarily correspond to a symmetry. We show that such anomalies can only be matched by gapped theories that exhibit either spontaneous symmetry breaking or symmetry fractionalization. In addition, we exhibit previously unstudied examples of these flux background anomalies that arise in $4d$ QCD and $4d$ SUSY QCD.</description>

      <title>Strong Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation in Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recent work has identified a new satellite galaxy, Ursa Major III/UNIONS I, which is the faintest such system ever observed. Dynamical considerations indicate that if the system is in equilibrium, it is likely to be highly dark matter dominated. This, in combination with its proximity, predicts that it may be the preeminent dwarf spheroidal galaxy target for dark matter indirect detection searches. We utilize 15 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for $\gamma$-ray emission from Ursa Major III. Finding no excess, we set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation. Intriguingly, if the high J-factor of Ursa Major III is confirmed, standard thermal dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states would be ruled out for dark matter masses up to 4 TeV. The discovery of Ursa Major III, combined with recent tentative measurements of other high J-factor systems, suggests the exciting possibility that near-future data could produce transformative constraints on thermal dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is string theory uniquely determined by self-consistency? Causality and unitarity seemingly permit a multitude of putative deformations, at least at the level of two-to-two scattering. Motivated by this question, we initiate a systematic exploration of the constraints on scattering from higher-point factorization, which imposes extraordinarily restrictive sum rules on the residues and spectra defined by a given amplitude. These bounds handily exclude several proposed deformations of the string: the simplest "bespoke" amplitudes with tunable masses and a family of modified string integrands from "binary geometry." While the string itself passes all tests, our formalism directly extracts the three-point amplitudes for the low-lying string modes without the aid of worldsheet vertex operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new subgrid model for neutrino quantum kinetics, which is primarily designed to incorporate effects of collective neutrino oscillations into neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae and mergers of compact objects. We approximate the neutrino oscillation term in quantum kinetic equation by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation-time prescription, and the transport equation is directly applicable for classical neutrino transport schemes. The BGK model is motivated by recent theoretical indications that non-linear phases of collective neutrino oscillations settle into quasi-steady structures. We explicitly provide basic equations of the BGK subgrid model for both multi-angle and moment-based neutrino transport to facilitate the implementation of the subgrid model in the existing neutrino transport schemes. We also show the capability of our BGK subgrid model by comparing to fully quantum kinetic simulations for fast neutrino-flavor conversion. We find that the overall properties can be well reproduced in the subgrid model; the error of angular-averaged survival probability of neutrinos is within $\sim 20 \%$. By identifying the source of error, we also discuss perspectives to improve the accuracy of the subgrid model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large uncertainties in the determinations of the equation of state of dense stellar matter allow the intriguing possibility that the bulk quark matter in beta equilibrium might be the true ground state of the matter at zero pressure. And quarks will form Cooper pairs very readily since the dominant interaction between quarks is attractive in some channels. As a result, quark matter will generically exhibit color superconductivity, with the favored pairing pattern at intermediately high densities being two-flavor pairing. In the light of several possible candidates for such self-bound quark stars, including the very low-mass central compact object in supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 reported recently, we carry out one field-theoretic model, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, of investigation on the stability of beta-stable two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase of quark matter, nevertheless find no physically-allowed parameter space for the existence of 2SC quark stars.</description>

Abstract: The $V_{lowk}$-renormalization group approach on the surface of Fermi liquid for nuclear matter to which Tom Kuo made a pioneering contribution at Stony Brook is found to inject the pivotal input in the formulation of the generalized nuclear effective field theory with acronym ``G$n$EFT" applicable to superdense compact-star physics. A topology change in terms of skyrmions and half-skyrmions is shown to play the role of the ``putative" hadron-quark continuity (HQC)" conjectured in QCD. Crucially involved are hidden local symmetry (``HLS") and hidden scale symmetry (``HSS") with the vacuum sliding with density in nuclear medium, with the nuclear tensor force emerging as a Landau Fermi-liquid fixed-point quantity. A possibly novel paradigm, a ``Cheshire Catism," in nuclear correlations is suggested.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>
