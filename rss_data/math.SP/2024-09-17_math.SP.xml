      <title>Characterization of the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz Newtonian operator N^k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newtonian potential operator for the Helmholtz equation, which is represented by the volume integral with fundamental solution as kernel function, is of great importance for direct and inverse scattering of acoustic waves. In this paper, the eigensystem for the Newtonian potential operator is firstly shown to be equivalent to that for the Helmholtz equation with nonlocal boundary condition for a bounded and simply connected Lipschitz-regular domain. Then, we compute explicitly the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Newtonian potential operator when it is defined in a 3-dimensional ball. Furthermore, the eigenvalues' asymptotic behavior is demonstrated. To illustrate the behavior of certain eigenfunctions, some numerical simulations are included.</description>

      <title>Non-Self-Adjoint Hill Operators whose Spectrum is a Real Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H = -d^2/dx^2 + q(x)$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, where $q(x)$ is a periodic potential, and suppose that the spectrum $\sigma(H)$ of $H$ is the positive semi-axis $[0, \infty)$. In the case where $q(x)$ is real-valued (and locally square-integrable) a well-known result of G. Borg states that $q(x)$ must vanish almost everywhere. However, as it was first observed by M.G. Gasymov, there is an abundance of complex-valued potentials for which $\sigma(H) = [0, \infty)$.
  In this article we conjecture a characterization of all complex-valued potentials whose spectrum is $[0, \infty)$. We also present an analog of Borg's result for complex potentials.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators of the form $H = -\Delta + V + v$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian, $V: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $-\Delta u + V u + v u = \lambda u$, for $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution $u \equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and analyzing different spectral regimes of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Constructing cospectral graphs via regular rational orthogonal matrix with level two and three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are \emph{cospectral} if the adjacency matrices share the same spectrum. Constructing cospectral non-isomorphic graphs has been studied extensively for many years and various constructions are known in the literature, e.g. the famous GM-switching method. In this paper, we shall construct cospectral graphs via regular rational orthogonal matrix $Q$ with level two and three. We provide two straightforward algorithms to characterize with adjacency matrix $A$ of graph $G$ such that $Q^TAQ$ is again a (0,1)-matrix, and introduce two new switching methods to construct families of cospectral graphs which generalized the GM-switching to some extent.</description>

      <title>Determinants of pseudo-laplacians and $\zeta^{({\rm reg})}(1)$ for spinor bundles over Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a point of a compact Riemann surface $X$. We study self-adjoint extensions of the Dolbeault Laplacians in hermitian line bundles $L$ over $X$ initially defined on sections with compact supports in $X\backslash\{P\}$. We define the $\zeta$-regularized determinants for these operators and derive comparison formulas for them. We introduce the notion of the Robin mass of $L$. This quantity enters the comparison formulas for determinants and is related to the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for the Dolbeault Laplacian. For spinor bundles of even characteristic, we find an explicit expression for the Robin mass. In addition, we propose an explicit formula for the Robin mass in the scalar case. Using this formula, we describe the evolution of the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for scalar Laplacian under the Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we find an alternative proof for the Morpurgo result that the round metric minimizes the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for surfaces of genus zero.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the shifted Coulomb Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp Lieb-Thirring (LT) inequalities for the family of shifted Coulomb Hamiltonians. More precisely, we prove the classical LT inequalities with the semi-classical constant for this family of operators in any dimension $d\geqslant 3$ and any $\gamma \geqslant 1$. We also prove that the semi-classical constant is never optimal for the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum (CLR) inequalities for this family of operators in any dimension. In this case, we characterize the optimal constant as the minimum of a finite set and provide an asymptotic expansion as the dimension grows. Using the same method to prove the CLR inequalities for Coulomb, we obtain more information about the conjectured optimal constant in the CLR inequality for arbitrary potentials.</description>
