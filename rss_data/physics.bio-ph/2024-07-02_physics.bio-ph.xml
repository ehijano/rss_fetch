      <title>High Throughput Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Applied to the Production of Mycoprotein from Synthetic Lignocellulosic Hydrolysates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current global food system produces substantial waste and carbon emissions while exacerbating the effects of global hunger and protein deficiency. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the use of lignocellulosic agricultural residues as feedstocks for microbial protein fermentation, focusing on Fusarium venenatum A3/5, a mycelial strain known for its high protein yield and quality. We propose a high throughput microlitre batch fermentation system paired with analytical chemistry to generate time-series data of microbial growth and substrate utilisation. An unstructured biokinetic model was developed using a bootstrap sampling approach to quantify uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The model was validated against an independent dataset of a different glucose-xylose composition to assess the predictive performance. Our results indicate a robust model fit with high coefficients of determination and low root mean squared errors for biomass, glucose, and xylose concentrations. Estimated parameter values provided insights into the resource utilisation strategies of Fusarium venenatum A3/5 in mixed substrate cultures, aligning well with previous research findings. Significant correlations between estimated parameters were observed, highlighting challenges in parameter identifiability. This work provides a foundational model for optimising the production of microbial protein from lignocellulosic waste, contributing to a more sustainable global food system.</description>

      <title>The relationship between parameters and effects in transcranial ultrasonic stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly gaining traction for non-invasive human neuromodulation, with a pressing need to establish protocols that maximise neuromodulatory efficacy. In this review, we aggregate and examine empirical evidence for the relationship between tunable TUS parameters and in vitro and in vivo outcomes. Based on this multiscale approach, TUS researchers can make better informed decisions about optimal parameter settings. Importantly, we also discuss the challenges involved in extrapolating results from prior empirical work to future interventions, including the translation of protocols between models and the complex interaction between TUS protocols and the brain. A synthesis of the empirical evidence suggests that larger effects will be observed at lower frequencies within the sub-MHz range, higher intensities and pressures than commonly administered thus far, and longer pulses and pulse train durations. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need for cautious interpretation of empirical data from different experimental paradigms when basing protocols on prior work as we advance towards refined TUS parameters for human neuromodulation.</description>

      <title>Learning data efficient coarse-grained molecular dynamics from forces and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned coarse-grained (MLCG) molecular dynamics is a promising option for modeling biomolecules. However, MLCG models currently require large amounts of data from reference atomistic molecular dynamics or substantial computation for training. Denoising score matching -- the technology behind the widely popular diffusion models -- has simultaneously emerged as a machine-learning framework for creating samples from noise. Models in the first category are often trained using atomistic forces, while those in the second category extract the data distribution by reverting noise-based corruption. We unify these approaches to improve the training of MLCG force-fields, reducing data requirements by a factor of 100 while maintaining advantages typical to force-based parameterization. The methods are demonstrated on proteins Trp-Cage and NTL9 and published as open-source code.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for droplet separation by surface tension using contact cantilevers -- applications to {\it{in situ}} diagnosis and treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an exact mathematical characterization of the meniscus formed by a liquid of density $\rho$ (model for tumor tissue) when probed with a cantilever device, operating by gravity (acceleration $g$) and with surface tension coefficient $\sigma$ (material-dependent for the specific choice of liquid and cantilever). The shape and extremal parameters (maximum height $\mathcal{H}$, break-off volume $\mathcal{V}$) of the meniscus formed, as functions of $\sigma, \rho$, are found by an exact analysis. Having knowledge of the explicit relationship between these parameters allows to perform in one procedure both diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics provide the underlying physical mechanism of the perceptual rivalry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceptual rivalry, where conflicting sensory information leads to alternating perceptions crucial for associated cognitive function, has attracted researcher's attention for long. Despite progresses being made, recent studies have revealed limitations and inconsistencies in our understanding across various rivalry contexts. We develop a unified physical framework, where perception undergoes a consecutive phase transition process encompassing different multi-state competitions. We reveal the underlying mechanisms of perceptual rivalry by identifying dominant switching paths among perceptual states and quantifying mean perceptual durations, switching frequencies, and proportions of different perceptions. We uncover the underlying nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics by analyzing average nonequilibrium flux and entropy production rate, while associated time series irreversibility reflects the underlying nonequilibrium mechanism of perceptual rivalry and link thermodynamical results with neuro-electrophysiological experiments. Our framework provides a global and physical understanding of brain perception, which may go beyond cognitive science or psychology but embodies the connection with wider fields as decision-making.</description>

      <title>Active Healing of Microtubule-Motor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks have a self-healing property where networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, both the mechanisms and dynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report an unexplored healing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We directly generate network cracks using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system, and observe that the cracks can self-heal. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack heals below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the crack. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is found to be tunable by two dimensionless geometric parameters, the ratio of the boundary layer and network width, and the aspect ratio of the network. Our results provide a new framework for understanding healing in cytoskeletal networks and designing self-healable biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>

      <title>Impact of Co-Excipient Selection on Hydrophobic Polymer Folding: Insights for Optimal Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stabilization of liquid biological products is a complex task that depends on the chemical composition of both the active ingredient and any excipients in solution. Frequently, a large number of unique excipients are required to stabilize biologics, though it is not well-known how these excipients interact with one another. To probe these excipient-excipient interactions, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of arginine -- a widely used excipient with unique properties -- in solution either alone or with equimolar lysine or glutamate. We studied the effects of these mixtures on a hydrophobic polymer model to isolate excipient mechanisms on hydrophobic interactions, relevant to both protein folding and biomolecular self-assembly. We observed that arginine is the most effective single excipient in stabilizing hydrophobic polymer collapse, and its effectiveness can be augmented by lysine or glutamate addition. We utilized a decomposition of the potential of mean force to identify that the key source of arginine-lysine and arginine-glutamate synergy on polymer collapse is a reduction in attractive polymer-excipient direct interactions. Further, we applied principles from network theory to characterize the local solvent network that embeds the hydrophobic polymer. Through this approach, we found that arginine enables a more highly connected and stable network than in pure water, lysine, or glutamate solutions. Importantly, these network properties are preserved when lysine or glutamate are added to arginine solutions. Overall, we highlight the importance of identifying key molecular consequences of co-excipient selection, aiding in the establishment of rational formulation design rules.</description>

      <title>Extending the Operational Lifetime of Nucleic Acid-Based Electrochemical Sensors via Protection Against Competitive Displacement of Oligonucleotides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors (NBEs) have emerged as a promising approach to continuous molecular monitoring in vivo. NBEs consist of electrically conducting gold surfaces coated with self-assembled monolayers of a mixture of electrode-passivating alkylthiols and functional alkylthiol-modified oligos. These oligos also display binding sites for the target analyte and redox reporters able to transfer electrons to the underlying gold electrode. Although sufficiently robust for continuous, multi-hour sensing of small molecules and proteins in biological fluids both in vitro and in vivo, NBEs decay over periods longer than 12 hours of continuous operation in these fluids. To address this issue, here we report a biofluid mimetic that can be leveraged to specifically study competitive displacement of oligonucleotides from NBEs, a critical sensor degradation pathway. Using this mimetic, we demonstrate three strategies that drastically mitigate competitive displacement and improve sensor stability in vitro. A combination of these strategies also improves sensor stability in vivo, demonstrated here via sensors emplaced in the brain cortex of live rats.</description>

      <title>Phase boundaries promote chemical reactions through localized fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the hypothesized functions of biomolecular condensates is to act as chemical reactors, where chemical reactions can be modulated, i.e. accelerated or slowed down, while substrate molecules enter and products exit from the condensate. Likewise, the components themselves that take part in the architectural integrity of condensates might be modified by active (energy consuming, non-equilibrium) processes, e.g. by ATPase chaperones or by kinases and phosphatases. In this work, we study how the presence of spatial inhomogeneities, such as in the case of liquid-liquid phase separation, affects active chemical reactions and results in the presence of directional flows of matter, which are one of the hallmarks of non-equilibirum processes. We establish the minimal conditions for the existence of such spatial currents, and we furthermore find that these fluxes are maximal at the condensate interface. These results propose that some condensates might be most efficient as chemical factories due to their interfaces rather than their volumes, and could suggest a possible biological reason for the the observed abundance of small non-fusing condensates inside the cell, thus maximizing their surface and the associated fluxes.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00695v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical methods based on thin multimode fibers (MMFs) are promising tools for measuring neuronal activity in deep brain regions of freely moving mice thanks to their small diameter. However, current methods are limited: while fiber photometry provides only ensemble activity, imaging techniques using of long multimode fibers are very sensitive to bending and have not been applied to unrestrained rodents yet. Here, we demonstrate the fundamentals of a new approach using a short MMF coupled to a miniscope. In proof-of-principle in vitro experiments, we disentangled spatio-temporal fluorescence signals from multiple fluorescent sources transmitted by a thin (200 \mu m) and short (8 mm) MMF, using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that low-cost open-source miniscopes have sufficient sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof-of-principle experiment, suggesting a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies using multimode fibers in freely behaving mice.</description>
