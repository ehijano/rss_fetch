      <title>Microscopic determination of the interacting boson-fermion model Hamiltonian from the nuclear energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic formulation of the interacting boson-fermion model for odd-$A$ nuclei is made using the nuclear energy density functional framework. Strength parameters for the bosonic Hamiltonian and boson-fermion interactions are shown to be determined completely so that energy surfaces and deformed single-particle energies of the Bose-Fermi systems should match the corresponding self-consistent mean-field solutions for fermionic systems. In an illustrative application to axially symmetric odd-$A$ Eu, this procedure is shown to be valid in describing spherical-to-deformed shape phase transitions in odd-$A$ and even-even systems.</description>

      <title>A background-free signal of jet-induced diffusion wake in quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation has been proposed as a robust signal of dijet-induced diffusion wake in quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We generalize this observable to other jet configurations such as {\gamma}/Z0-jets and propose a new method to compute the rapidity asymmetry that is free of background. In this new method, the rapidity of the trigger is fixed or restricted to a symmetrical range while the rapidity of the associated jet is varied. The rapidity asymmetry is defined as the difference between the hadron rapidity distribution in the opposite azimuthal direction of the jet (or the same direction of the trigger) with different associated jet rapidities. Since the background in this hadron rapidity distribution with different associated jet rapidity is identical, it will be completely canceled in the rapidity asymmetry. Such background-free rapidity asymmetry caused by jet-induced diffusion wake is demonstrated in CoLBT-hydro simulations of dijets and {\gamma}-jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, which weakens as hadron pT increases, and subtraction of a p+p baseline has a negligible effect.</description>

      <title>Instability windows of relativistic r-modes in stably stratified neutron stars with hyperonic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) $R$-modes are oscillations in rotating stars, primarily restored by the Coriolis force. These oscillations are the most susceptible to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave emission, which makes them promising targets for current and future gravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome dissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable only for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\Omega$ and (redshifted) temperature $T^\infty$, defining the so-called instability window on the $(\Omega, T^\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant dissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two independent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly increases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of relativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify dissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first investigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode instability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical reactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity. We further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability windows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may provide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the fastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity are taken into account. These results have important implications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader understanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars: Structure and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the evolution of the global properties of magnetized proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across four key stages: neutrino-trapping, deleptonization, the neutrino-transparent phase, and the formation of a cold, catalyzed neutron star (NS). We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with strong magnetic fields of approximately 10^17 Gauss. The stellar matter is modeled using equations of state (EoS) derived from relativistic mean-field theory, employing density-dependent couplings calibrated by the DDME2 parameterization. We analyze how the gravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal composition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our results show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing lepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes enhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation, facilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the efficiency of magnetic field decay. We find that dissipation is fastest during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases, a process that ultimately defines the observable magnetic field of the mature NS.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Bremsstrahlung Gamma Ray Emission and Short-Range Correlations in $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn Collisions at 25 MeV/u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-range correlation (SRC) in nuclei refers to the nucleons forming temporally correlated pairs in close proximity, giving rise to the high momentum of the nucleons beyond the Fermi surface. It has been reported that bremsstrahlung $\gamma$ production from neutron-proton process in heavy-ion reactions provides a potential probe of the existence of SRC in nuclei. In this paper, we present in detail the precision measurement of bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays in $\rm ^{124}Sn$+$\rm ^{124}Sn$ reactions at 25 MeV/u using the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy IoN Experiment (CSHINE). The experimental setup, detector calibration, trigger scheme and data analysis procedures as well as the model comparison are presented in detail. Background contributions are subtracted using two methods to ensure robustness. By comparing the experimental $\gamma$ spectrum with the Isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck simulations, the high momentum tail (HMT) fraction of $R_{\rm HMT}=(20 \pm 3)\%$ is derived in $^{124}$Sn nuclei. This work presents the detailed experimental measurement and analysis framework for the precise determination of the HMT fraction via bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray emission, demonstrating a new paradigm to study nucleon SRCs in nuclei using low-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars as a dense liquid drop at equilibrium within the effective surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The macroscopic model is formulated for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium. We use
  the leptodermic approximation $a/R\ll 1$, where $a$ is the crust thickness of the effective NS surface (ES), and $R$ is the mean radius
  of the ES curvature. Within the approximate Schwarzschild metric solution to the general relativity theory equations for the spherically
  symmetric systems, the macroscopic gravitation is taken into account in terms of the total separation particle energy and incompressibility.
  Density distribution $\rho$ across the ES in the normal direction to the ES was obtained analytically for a general form of the energy density
  $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$. For the typical crust thickness, and effective radius, one finds the leading expression for the density $\rho$. NS masses
  are analytically calculated as a sum of the volume and surface terms, taking into account the radial curvature of the metric space, in reasonable
  agreement with the recently measured masses for several neutron stars. We derive the simple macroscopic equation of state (EoS) with the surface
  correction. The analytical and numerical solutions to Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for the pressure are in good agreement with the volume
  part of our EoS.</description>

      <title>Role of thermal fluctuations in nucleation of three-flavor quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework that aims to investigate the role of thermal fluctuations of the matter composition and color-superconductivity in the nucleation of three-flavor deconfined quark matter in the typical conditions of high-energy astrophysical systems related to compact stars. It is usually assumed that the flavor composition is locally fixed during the formation of the first seed of deconfined quark matter since weak interaction acts too slowly to re-equilibrate flavors. However, the matter composition fluctuates around its average equilibrium values at the typical temperatures of high-energy astrophysical processes. Here, we extend our previous two-flavor nucleation formalism to a three-flavor case. We develop a thermodynamic framework incorporating finite-size effects and thermal fluctuations of local composition to compute the nucleation probability as the product of droplet formation and composition fluctuation rates. Moreover, we discuss the role of color-superconductivity in nucleation, arguing that it can play a role only in systems larger than the typical coherence length of diquark pairs. We found that thermal fluctuations of the matter composition lead to lowering the potential barrier between the metastable hadronic phase and the stable quark phase. Moreover, the formation of diquark pairs reduces the critical radius and thus the potential barrier in the low baryon density and temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Bound states of $_{c\bar{c}}^{9}$Be within $c\bar{c}+\alpha+\alpha$ cluster models based on state-of-the-art HAL QCD charmonium-nucleon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible bound state of the $ _{c\bar{c}}^{9}$Be, a charmonium-nucleus system, is investigated. The analysis is carried out within a three-cluster model, where its binary subsystems are represented as $ c\bar{c}\textrm{+}\alpha $ and $\alpha+\alpha$. The hyperspherical harmonics method is employed to facilitate a convenient description of this three-cluster configuration. The calculations are done by employing the effective $ c\bar{c}\textrm{-}\alpha $ potentials.
  These potentials were derived recently based on state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations, which provided interactions for the spin 3/2 $J/\psi N $, spin 1/2 $J/\psi N $, spin 1/2 $\eta_{c}N$ and spin-averaged $J/\psi N$ interactions, all obtained with nearly physical pion masses. The Coulomb interaction was also incorporated into the current calculations. It is determined that, despite neither the $ _{c\bar{c}}^{5}$He nor the $^{8}$Be binary subsystems being bound, a bound state of the $ c\bar{c}\textrm{-} \alpha\alpha$ nuclear system could potentially exist. The maximum central binding energy is found to be approximately 1.71 MeV, based on the spin 1/2 $J/\psi N $ interaction, while a minimum value of about 0.56 MeV is obtained from calculations involving the spin 1/2 $\eta_{c}N$ interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the details of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from helium-3 to iron.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscosity for a pure glue theory using an effective matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At nonzero temperatures, the deconfining phase transition can be analyzed using an effective matrix model to characterize the change in holonomy. The model includes gluons and two-dimensional ghost fields in the adjoint representation, or ``teens''. As ghosts, the teen fields are responsible for the decrease of the pressure as $T \rightarrow T_d$, with $T_d$ the transition temperature for deconfinement. Using the solution of this matrix model for a large number of colors, the parameters of the teen fields are adjusted so that the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is close to the values from the lattice. The shear, $\eta$, and bulk, $\zeta$, viscosities are computed in weak coupling but nonzero holonomy. In the pure glue theory, the value of the Polyakov loop is relatively large in the deconfined phase, $\approx 1/2$ at $T_d$. Consequently, if $s$ is the entropy density, while $\eta/s$ decreases as $T\rightarrow T_d$, it is still well above the conformal bound. In contrast, $\zeta/s$ is largest at $T_d$, comparable to $\eta/s$, then falls off rapidly with increasing temperature and is negligible by $\sim 2 T_d$.</description>

Abstract: We determine the initial condition of the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using HERA deep inelastic scattering data. Posterior distributions characterizing the initial condition are extracted using Bayesian inference. The total cross section and charm quark production data from HERA are found to provide stringent constraints on the posterior. These distributions quantify the uncertainty in the initial condition and serve as necessary input for propagating uncertainties to all NLO calculations within the Color Glass Condensate framework.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>
