      <title>UniPhy: Unifying Riemannian-Clifford Geometry and Biorthogonal Dynamics for Planetary-Scale Continuous Weather Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data-driven weather models have achieved remarkable deterministic accuracy, they fundamentally rely on discrete-time mappings and closed-system assumptions, failing to capture the multi-scale continuous dynamics and thermodynamic openness of the atmosphere. To address these limitations, we propose UniPhy, a continuous-time non-Hermitian neural stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) solver. Geometrically, we employ Riemannian-Clifford gauge transformations to flatten planetary heterogeneity, enabling globally consistent operations. Dynamically, we construct non-Hermitian biorthogonal spectral operators integrated with a global flux tracker to capture transient energy growth and open-system exchange. Computationally, by identifying the algebraic associativity of the analytic solution, we reformulate adaptive physical integration as a parallel prefix-sum problem, achieving log-linear sequence parallelism. UniPhy establishes a physically complete foundation model architecture that unifies geometric adaptivity, thermodynamic consistency, and computational efficiency. Our code is available at &lt;https://github.com/yrqUni/UniPhy&gt;.</description>

      <title>A complete phase-field fracture model for brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brittle materials subjected to thermal shocks experience strong temperature gradients that in turn give rise to mechanical stresses that can be large enough to induce fracture. This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>A single-stage high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme in arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development of a compact gas-kinetic scheme using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for structured meshes. Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method.</description>

      <title>Optimising Microwave Cavities for nonzero Helicity with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-driven inverse design framework for systematically engineering three-dimensional microwave cavity resonators that support modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity. In contrast to heuristic approaches to cavity design, helicity maximisation is formulated as a boundary-shape optimisation problem, enabling systematic exploration of complex boundary-shape parameter spaces and the identification of high-helicity designs that are difficult to predict using heuristic design rules alone. We applied this framework to several cavity families composed of smooth, edge-free components, including globally twisted cavities with control-point-defined cross-sections realised in both linear and ring configurations, cavities defined by the intersection of orthogonal prisms, sphere-subtracted cylindrical cavities, and parametrised surface resonators. Two gradient-free optimisation strategies, a genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation, were independently employed to explore compact sets of design parameters for these geometries and to optimise a scaled-helicity figure of merit for the dominant helical mode, evaluated via finite-element eigenmode analysis. Robustness to manufacturing tolerances was quantified by applying Gaussian geometric perturbations to the optimised cavities and evaluating statistical robustness metrics that penalise sensitivity to geometric variation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Space-Charge-Limited Current Density for Time-Variant Pulsed Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-charge-limited (SCL) current density for time-invariant injection (under long-pulse condition) via the diode cathode is the maximum transportable density, while it can be leveraged higher when the injection pulselength becomes shorter than the transmit time for electrons (i.e., under short-pulse condition). However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition.</description>

      <title>Wave Particle Turbulent Simulation of Spatially Developing Round Jets Using a Non Equilibrium Transport Model with a Mixing Length Characteristic Time Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the wave-particle turbulent simulation (WPTS), a recently developed multiscale, non-equilibrium turbulence modeling approach, is coupled with a turbulence characteristic-time closure derived from Prandtl mixing-length hypothesis and applied to spatially developing round jets. In WPTS, fluid elements in strongly turbulent regions are represented by Lagrangian particles that travel a finite distance before interacting with the background flow field represented in a wave-like (Eulerian) form. This mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the discrete fluid parcels invoked in the Prandtl mixing-length picture. WPTS differs from conventional mixing-length-based turbulence models in two key respects. First, particle evolution follows a non-equilibrium transport mechanism, rather than the equilibrium assumptions typically embedded in eddy-viscosity closures. Second, WPTS advances the wave and particle components in a coupled manner, with the particle fraction governed primarily by the modeled turbulence characteristic time, enabling laminar and turbulent regimes to be represented within a unified framework. Because spatially developing jets provide a canonical test case with well-established similarity behavior, they are used here for evaluation. Specifically, this work (1) develops a mixing-length-based characteristic-time model tailored to jet flows and (2) incorporates it into WPTS to assess predictive performance. The resulting WPTS framework accurately reproduces the jet similarity solution and other characteristic features at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 20,000, demonstrating the promise of WPTS as a practical tool for turbulence modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Machine Learning of Electron Density for Twisted Bilayer Moir\'e Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit rich quantum phenomena, but ab initio modelling of these systems remains computationally prohibitive. Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moir\'e materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information.</description>

      <title>Supervised Metric Regularization Through Alternating Optimization for Multi-Regime Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often face challenges when modeling parameterized dynamical systems with sharp regime transitions, such as bifurcations. In these scenarios, the continuous mapping from parameters to solutions can result in spectral bias or "mode collapse", where the network averages distinct physical behaviors. We propose a Topology-Aware PINN (TAPINN) that aims to mitigate this challenge by structuring the latent space via Supervised Metric Regularization. Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.</description>

      <title>Empirical Stability Analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Hard-Constrained Recurrent Physics-Informed Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into hard-constrained recurrent physics-informed architectures (HRPINN) to evaluate the fidelity of learned residual manifolds in oscillatory systems. Motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and preliminary gray-box results, we hypothesized that KANs would enable efficient recovery of unknown terms compared to MLPs. Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.</description>

      <title>PySlice: Routine Vibrational Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Prediction with Universal Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope can reveal phonon excitations with nanometer spatial resolution, yet routine prediction remains out of reach due to fragmented workflows requiring specialized expertise. Here we introduce PySlice, the first publicly available implementation of the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunction (TACAW) method, providing an automated framework that produces momentum- and energy-resolved vibrational electron energy-loss spectra directly from atomic structures. By integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials with TACAW, PySlice eliminates the bottleneck of per-system potential development. Users input atomic structures and obtain phonon dispersions, spectral diffraction patterns, and spectrum images through a unified workflow spanning molecular dynamics, GPU-accelerated electron scattering, and frequency-domain analysis. We outline the formulation behind the code, demonstrate its application to canonical systems in materials science, and discuss its use for advanced analysis and materials exploration. The modular Python architecture additionally supports conventional electron microscopy simulations, providing a general-purpose platform for imaging and diffraction calculations. PySlice makes vibrational spectroscopy prediction routine rather than specialized, enabling computational screening for experimental design, systematic exploration of phonon physics across materials families, and high-throughput generation of simulated data for training of future machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting governing physical laws from computational or experimental data is crucial across various fields such as fluid dynamics and plasma physics. Many of those physical laws are dissipative due to fluid viscosity or plasma collisions. For such a dissipative physical system, we propose a framework to learn the corresponding laws of the systems based on their energy-dissipation laws, assuming either continuous data (probability density) or discrete data (particles) are available. Our methods offer several key advantages, including their robustness to corrupted/noisy observations, their easy extension to more complex physical systems, and the potential to address higher-dimensional systems. We validate our approaches through representative numerical examples and carefully investigate the impacts of data quantity and data property on model discovery.</description>

      <title>diffpy.morph: Python tools for model independent comparisons between sets of 1D functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.</description>

      <title>SIMSHIFT: A Benchmark for Adapting Neural Surrogates to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on problem configurations outside their training distribution, such as new initial conditions or structural dimensions. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language to generalize across domains without additional labeled data, their application to complex engineering simulations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks spanning diverse processes and physics: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established UDA methods to state-of-the-art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out-of-distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of UDA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

      <title>Variational approach to open quantum systems with long-range competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of X2NiH6 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba) Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage Applications</title>

Abstract: First-principles DFT calculations on the hydrides Ca2NiH6, Sr2NiH6, and Ba2NiH6 reveal key thermodynamic properties. These compounds exhibit increasing entropy and heat capacity with temperature, and are thermodynamically stable at elevated temperatures due to negative free energies. The kinetics of hydrogen storage is influenced by entropy changes during hydrogen adsorption and desorption. Optically, Ba2NiH6 shows a high refractive index at low energies. Mechanical assessments indicate Sr2NiH6 is incompressible with moderate malleability, Ca2NiH6 has the highest resistance to deformation, while Ba2NiH6 is most compressible. Formation energies and hydrogen storage capacities (4.005 wt% for Ca2NiH6, 2.548 wt% for Sr2NiH6, and 1.750 wt% for Ba2NiH6) highlight Ca2NiH6 as the most promising candidate for hydrogen storage technology.</description>

      <title>Qhronology: A Python package for studying quantum models of closed timelike curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qhronology is a novel scientific-computing package for studying quantum models of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and simulating general quantum information processing and computation. Written in Python, the program provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing quantum theories of antichronological time travel, including functionality to calculate quantum resolutions to temporal paradoxes. It also operates as a complete quantum circuit simulator, enabling the examination of quantum algorithms and protocols in both numerical and symbolic capacities. In this paper, we formally introduce Qhronology, beginning with discussion on aspects of its design philosophy and architecture. An overview of its basic usage is then presented, along with a collection of examples demonstrating its various capabilities within a variety of distinct contexts. Lastly, the performance of the package's circuit simulation component is characterized by way of some simple empirical benchmarking.</description>
