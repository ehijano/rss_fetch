      <title>KnotResolver: Tracking self-intersecting filaments in microscopy using directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of microscopy time-series of in vitro reconstituted motor driven microtubule (MT) transport in 'gliding assays' is typically performed using computational object tracking tools. However, these are limited to non-intersecting and rod-like filaments. Here, we describe a novel computational image-analysis pipeline, KnotResolver, to track image time-series of highly curved self-intersecting looped filaments (knots) by resolving cross-overs. The code integrates filament segmentation and cross-over or 'knot' identification based on directed graph representation, where nodes represent cross-overs and edges represent the path connecting them. The graphs are mapped back to contours and the distance to a reference minimized. We demonstrate the utility of the tool by segmentation and tracking MTs from experiments with dynein-driven wave like filament looping. The accuracy of contour detection is sub-pixel accuracy, and Dice scores indicate a robustness to noise, better than currently used tools. Thus KnotResolver overcomes multiple limitations of widely used tools in microscopy of cytoskeletal filament-like structures.</description>

      <title>The light quantum mechanism of PCR efficiency oscillation with gold nanoparticle concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of nanomaterials in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has opened new avenues for improving detection methods in the biomedical field. Recent experiments (Chem. Eur. J. 2023, e202203513) have revealed oscillatory behavior between PCR efficiency and the concentration of gold nanoparticles in the pM range, potentially linked to the long-range Coulomb interactions among charged colloidal particles and the quantum size effect of nanoparticle electronic states. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that the radial distribution function of gold nanoparticles in solution gradually exhibits peak characteristics with increasing charge, triggering coherent photon behavior in Rayleigh scattering within the solution, thereby influencing the efficiency of reusing released photons in the PCR chain reaction. The study demonstrates that the oscillation period aligns with the wavelength of downstream reaction photons, while their energy matches the width of energy levels near the Fermi level of gold nanoparticles. The latter can absorb and store electron states internally, promoting upstream PCR reactions through subsequent re-release, and compensating for energy deficiencies through the Boltzmann distribution of electrons. This work is poised to advance the application of PCR-specific precise detection methods in the field of quantum biotechnology.</description>

      <title>The Required Spatial Resolution to Assess Imbalance using Plantar Pressure Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roughly 1/3 of adults older than 65 fall each year, resulting in more than 3 million emergency room visits, thousands of deaths, and over $50 Billion in direct costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1/3 of falls are preventable with effective mitigation strategies, particularly for imbalance. Therefore, quantification of imbalance is being studied extensively in recent years. In this study we investigate the feasibility of plantar pressure mapping in balance assessment through a healthy human subject study. We used an in-house plantar pressure mapping device with high precision based on Frustrated Total Internal Reflection to measure subjects sway during the Romberg test. Through the measurements obtained from all subjects, we measured the minimum spatial resolution required for plantar pressure mapping devices in assessment of balance. We conclude that most of the current devices in the market lack the requirements for imbalance measurements.</description>
