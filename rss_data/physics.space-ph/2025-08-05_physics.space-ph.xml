      <title>Verification of the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center solar flare forecast (1998-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issues the official U.S. government forecast for M-class and X-class solar flares, yet the skill of these forecasts has never been comprehensively verified. In this study, we evaluate the SWPC probabilistic flare forecasts over a 26-year period (1998-2024), comparing them to several zero-cost and statistical baselines including persistence, climatology, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. We find that the SWPC model does not outperform these baselines across key classification and probabilistic metrics and exhibits severe calibration issues and high false alarm rates, especially in high-stakes scenarios such as detecting the first flare after extended quiet periods. These findings demonstrate the need for more accurate and reliable eruption forecasting models which we suggest should be based on modern data-driven methods. The findings also provide a standard against which any proposed eruption prediction system should be compared. We suggest that space weather forecasters regularly update and publish analyses like the one demonstrated here to provide up-to-date standards of accuracy and reliability against which to compare new methods.</description>

      <title>Impact of Solar Particle Events on Space Radiation Shielding: OLTARIS Simulation and Quantum Optimization of Material Selection using QAOA and VQE Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space radiation poses a significant challenge for long duration human space missions, with sources including Galactic Cosmic Rays, Solar Particle Events, and trapped particles in the Van Allen belts. These high-energy radiations cause severe biological effects on astronauts and degrade spacecraft systems, making effective shielding critical. Traditionally, passive shielding materials like aluminum have been used, but their limitations, particularly in generating secondary radiation, necessitate better alternatives. In this study, the performance of shielding materials such as lithium hydride, polyethylene, lithium borohydride, beryllium borohydride, and ammonia borane are evaluated in GCR and SPE environments using OLTARIS, a NASA developed tool. The October 1989 SPE is used to study particle flux and dose distributions. Shielding effectiveness varies by environment. Beryllium borohydride performs best in SPE, while lithium hydride gives the lowest dose in GCR. In SPE, performance is linked to hydrogen content. Effect of Solar modulation on GCR dose is also studied. Higher modulation lowers GCR intensity and dose. The complex nature of high energy space radiation and material combinations creates computational challenges. To address this, the material selection problem is modeled as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization and solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Mapping OLTARIS data to the Ising model and applying these quantum classical methods helped identify shielding setups that minimize radiation dose. Results show agreement between OLTARIS and quantum optimization for both environments.</description>

      <title>The multi-physics analysis, design and testing of CUSP, a CubeSat mission for space weather and solar flares x-ray polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. As part of CUSP's Phase B study, which began in December 2024 and will last one year, we present the current development status of the design solutions adopted for the mission's most critical multi-physics design drivers. These solutions have been formulated and applied to demonstrate compliance with system requirements at both the spacecraft and platform levels. In particular, we describe the mechanical design of each structural component, the results of static, dynamic finite element analyses, and a proposal for topological optimization of the interface between the platform and payload and some fixture for test, and the preliminary environmental testing campaign (e.g., vibration, shock) that will be carried out on a mechanical demonstrator.</description>

      <title>Prompt identification of solar wind stream interaction regions from Survey Burst 1 Mode observations of the Radio and Plasma Wave experiment on Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying stream interaction regions (SIRs), from their inception and the dynamics of their development, can provide insight into solar-terrestrial connections. Some in-situ instruments on the Solar Orbiter (SolO) space mission are designed to measure solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field parameters along the flight path. These instruments are ideal for studying the dynamics of SIR evolution at heliocentric distances of 0.28-1.0 AU and with changes in heliolatitude of $0^\circ$- $33^\circ$. To address the challenges of promptly identifying SIRs and predicting their arrival time on Earth, we consider using trigger events from the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPW)/SolO instrument, which are transmitted in telemetry data packages. We suggest that multiple activations of the trigger mode (SBM1 mode) in the RPW instrument over an interval of up to four hours may reflect the fine structure of large-scale events in SW. Such events can serve as markers for the spacecraft's location within the SIR. In this regard, the 2023 analysis revealed that multiple activations of the SBM1 trigger mode throughout the day accounted for more than 50$\%$ of the total number of days for which such events were recorded. Of this number, 63$\%$ were events when the trigger algorithm was prompted repeatedly within a time interval of up to four hours. A comparison of the registration times of SBM1 trigger events with the SW parameters obtained from the SWA-PAS and MAG instruments showed that repeated activations of the trigger algorithm occurred at the stream interface surface when a high-speed SW stream and a formed compression region were present.</description>
