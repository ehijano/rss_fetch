      <title>The inter-universal Teichm\"uller theory and new Diophantine results over the rational numbers. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying inter-universal Teichm\"uller theory and its slight modification over the rational number field, we prove new Diophantine results towards effective abc inequalities and the generalized Fermat equations.
  For coprime integers $a, b, c$ satisfying $a + b = c$ and $\log(|abc|) \geq 700$, we prove $$ \log|abc| \leq 3\log\mathrm{rad}(abc) + 8\sqrt{\log|abc| \cdot \log\log|abc|}. $$ This implies for any $0 &lt; \epsilon \leq \frac{1}{10}$, $$ |abc| \leq \max\left\{\exp\left(400 \cdot \epsilon^{-2} \cdot \log(\epsilon^{-1})\right),\ \mathrm{rad}(abc)^{3+3\epsilon}\right\}, $$ reducing the constant in effective abc bounds from $1.7 \cdot 10^{30}$ (Mochizuki-Fesenko-Hoshi-Minamide-Porowski) to $400$.
  For positive primitive solutions $(x, y, z)$ to the generalized Fermat equation $x^r + y^s = z^t$ ($r, s, t \geq 3$), define $h = \log(x^r y^s z^t)$. We prove explicit bounds: \begin{gather*} h \leq 573\ \ (r, s, t \geq 8); \; h \leq 907\ \ (r, s, t \geq 5); \; h \leq 2283\ \ (r, s, t \geq 4); \\ h \leq 14750\ \ (\min\{r, s\} \geq 4\ \text{or}\ t \geq 4); \; h \leq 24626\ \ (r, s, t \geq 3). \end{gather*} These imply Fermat's Last Theorem (FLT) holds unconditionally for prime exponents $\geq 11$. Combined with classical results for FLT with exponents $3, 4, 5, 7$, this yields a new alternative proof of FLT. Computational verification confirms no non-trivial primitive solution exists when $r, s, t \geq 20$ or $(r, s, t)$ is a permutation of $(3, 3, n)$ ($n \geq 3$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hurwitz-type analogue of Schur multiple zeta-functions involving shifting parameters. We extend various formulas, known for ordinary Schur multiple zeta-functions, to the case of Hurwitz type. We also mention unpublished results proved by Yamamoto and by Minoguchi. Further we present new formulas obtained by performing differentiation with respect to shifting parameters.</description>

      <title>Hermite numbers and new families of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operational calculus associated with Hermite numbers has been shown to be an effective tool for simplifying the study of special functions. Within this context, Hermite polynomials have been viewed as Newton binomials, with the consequent possibility of establishing previously unknown properties. In this article, this method is extended to study the lacunary Hermite polynomials and obtain novel results concerning their generating functions, recurrence relations, differential equations and certain integral transforms. Furthermore, we extend the idea to combinatorial interpretation of these polynomials, broadening their applicability in mathematical analysis and discrete structures.</description>

      <title>Generation of Hecke fields by squares of cyclotomic twists of modular $L$-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a non-CM elliptic newform without a quadratic inner twist, $p$ an odd prime and $\chi$ a Dirichlet character of $p$-power order and sufficiently large $p$-power conductor. We show that the compositum $\mathbb{Q}_{f}(\chi)$ of the Hecke fields associated to $f$ and $\chi$ is generated by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding central $L$-value $L^{\rm alg}(1/2, f \otimes \chi)$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\mu_p)$. The proof is based among other things on techniques used for the recent resolution of unipotent mixing conjecture due to Blomer and Michel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting Cantor set methods that were used by Hall and Hlawka for regular continued fractions, we prove that every real number can be obtained as the sum of two real numbers for which the partial fractions in their nearest integer continued fraction expansion do not exceed 5 (with the zeroth partial fraction as the only possible exception). Furthermore, we prove that it is not possible to replace 5 by 4 in this result.</description>

      <title>Locally and Polar Harmonic Maass Forms for Orthogonal Groups of Signature $(2, n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the notions of locally and polar harmonic Maass forms to general orthogonal groups of signature $(2, n)$ with singularities along real analytic and algebraic cycles. We prove a current equation for locally harmonic Maass forms and recover the Fourier expansion of the Oda lift involving cycle integrals. Moreover, using the newly defined polar harmonic Maass forms, we prove that meromorphic modular forms with singularities along special divisors are orthogonal to cusp forms with respect to a regularized Petersson inner product. Using this machinery, we derive a duality theorem involving cycle integrals of meromorphic modular forms along real analytic cycles and cycle integrals of locally harmonic Maass forms along algebraic cycles.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for Heisenberg extensions of degree $p^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field and $p$ be an odd prime number. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for separable field extensions $K/k$, i.e. the determination of the Shafarevich-Tate group $Sha(T)$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$, with $[K:k]=p^3$ or $p^2$ when the Galois group of the Galois closure of $K/k$ is the Heisenberg group $E_p(p^3)\simeq (C_p)^2\rtimes C_p$ of order $p^3$, i.e. the extraspecial group of order $p^3$ with exponent $p$. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=p^2$, $p$ or $1$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following work of Mazur-Tate and Satoh, we extend the definition of division polynomials to arbitrary isogenies of elliptic curves, including those whose kernels do not sum to the identity. In analogy to the classical case of division polynomials for multiplication-by-n, we demonstrate recurrence relations, identities relating to classical elliptic functions, the chain rule describing relationships between division polynomials on source and target curve, and generalizations to higher dimension (i.e., elliptic nets).</description>

      <title>Pair Correlation Conjecture for the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function I: simple and critical zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Montgomery in 1973 introduced the Pair Correlation Conjecture (PCC) for zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. In addition he conjectured that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are simple. His reasoning to support these two conjectures made free use of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH). Using a different method, Gallagher and Mueller proved in 1978 that PCC under RH implies that 100% of the zeros are simple, but we show here that their method does not actually require RH. Thus Montgomery's second conjecture follows from his PCC conjecture. Recent work has shown that one can use pair correlation methods to obtain information not only on the vertical distribution of zeros, but also on the horizontal distribution. Applying this idea to Gallagher and Mueller's method, we show that PCC implies that asymptotically 100% of the zeros are both simple and on the critical line.</description>

      <title>Decomposition results for multiplicative actions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>

      <title>On Log-Concave Operator Acting on Sequences and Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15425v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of sequences and series under the action of the log-concave operator \(\mathcal{L}\). We explore the relationship between the convergence of a sequence \((a_k)\) and the convergence of sequences and series derived by applying \(\mathcal{L}\) iteratively. These results demonstrate the strong regularity properties of log-concave sequences and provide a framework for analyzing the convergence of sequences and series derived from the log-concave operator. The findings have implications for combinatorics, probability, optimization, and related fields, opening new avenues for further research on the behavior of log-concave sequences and their associated operators.</description>

      <title>On the prime Selmer ranks of cyclic prime twist families of elliptic curves over global function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11486v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of characteristic coprime to 2, 3, and $p$, which also contains the primitive $p$-th root of unity $\mu_p$. Based on the works by Swinnerton-Dyer and Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, we prove that the probability distribution of the sizes of prime Selmer groups over a family of cyclic prime twists of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ satisfying a number of mild constraints conforms to the distribution conjectured by Bhargava, Kane, Lenstra, Poonen, and Rains with explicit error bounds. The key tools used in proving these results are the Riemann hypothesis over global function fields, the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, and the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of orders of reductions of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$ and $\widetilde{E}_p$ denote the reduction of $E$ modulo a prime $p$ of good reduction for $E$. The divisibility of $|\widetilde{E}_{p}(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ by an integer $m\ge 2$ for a set of primes $p$ of density $1$ is determined by the torsion subgroups of elliptic curves that are $\mathbb Q$-isogenous to $E$. In this work, we give explicit families of elliptic curves $E$ over $\mathbb Q$ together with integers $m_E$ such that the congruence class of $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ modulo $m_E$ can be computed explicitly. In addition, we can estimate the density of primes $p$ for which each congruence class occurs. These include elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$ whose torsion grows over a quadratic field $K$ where $m_E$ is determined by the $K$-torsion subgroups in the $\mathbb Q$-isogeny class of $E$. We also exhibit elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q(t)$ for which the orders of the reductions of every smooth fiber modulo primes of positive density strictly less than $1$ are divisible by given small integers.</description>

An application to an apparently new problem on oscillations of characters on differences between Farey fractions is given. Other applications include a modular analogue of a multiplicative hybrid problem of Iwaniec and S\'ark\"ozy (1987) and the solvability of some prime type equations with constraints.</description>

      <title>Indices of nilpotency in certain spaces of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the index of nilpotency relative to certain Hecke operators in spaces of modular forms with integer weight and level $N$ with integer coefficients modulo primes $p$ for $(p, N) \in \{(3, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (3, 4)\}$. In these settings, we prove upper bounds on certain indices of nilpotency. As an application of our bounds, we prove infinite families of congruences for $p^t$-core partition functions modulo $p$ for $p\in \{3, 5, 7\}$ and $t\geq 1$, and we prove an infinite family of congruences modulo $3$ for the $r$th power partition function, $p_r(n)$, when $r = 12k$ with $\gcd(k,6) = 1$. We also include conjectures on a function which quantifies degree lowering on powers of the Delta function by the relevant Hecke operators in these settings, and on the index of nilpotency relative to a modification of this degree-lowering function.</description>

      <title>Sums related to Euler's totient function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00389v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an upper bound for the sum $\sum_{n\leq N} (a_{n}/\varphi (a_{n}))^{s}$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function, $s\in \mathbb{N}$, and $a_{1},\ldots, a_{N}$ are positive integers (not necessarily distinct) with some restrictions. As applications, for any $t&gt;0$, we obtain an upper bound for the number of $n\in [1,N]$ such that $a_{n}/ \varphi (a_{n})&gt; t$.</description>

      <title>A generalized Schmidt's subspace theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schmidt's subspace theorem in terms of Seshadri constants for closed subschemes in subgeneral position has been already developed sharply. We derive our theorem for numerically equivalent ample divisors by dint of the above theory step by step, providing a joint generalization of Schmidt's theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems defined by polynomials with algebraic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let (x_n; n\in Z) be a bisequence of elements x_n in the 1-dimensional torus R/Z, which is called a stream over R/Z. Let P(z)=a_k z^k+...+a_1 z+a_0 be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Define the set of streams over R/Z such that the convolution product P(z)\times(x_n; n\in Z)=(\sum_{i=0}^k a_i x_{n-i}; n\in Z)=(0; n\in Z), which is called the stream 0 of P. We study similarities between stream 0 of P and the roots of P(z)=0.</description>

      <title>Diophantine enumeration of Dynkin friezes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture and show that there are precisely $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral $E_7$-friezes and $E_8$-friezes respectively, completing the enumerative classification of all positive integral friezes of Dynkin type. We also give new Diophantine proofs of the enumeration theorems for friezes of all other Dynkin types, which were previously proved using discrete geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and the theory of cluster algebras. In general, we count Dynkin friezes of rank $n$ by determining the positive integral points on certain $n$-dimensional affine varieties with infinitely many integral points.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H^{ab}|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{k/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ and $H^{ab}$ are the abelianizations of $G$ and $H$ respectively, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,G_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>The action of the Morava stabilizer group on the coefficients of Morava E-theory at height 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate an explicit closed formula for the action of the height 2 full Morava stabilizer group on the coefficient ring of height 2 Morava E-theory. In particular, this yields an explicit, surprisingly simple closed formula for the action of the automorphism group of a height 2 formal group law on its Lubin-Tate deformation ring. The formula is of a combinatorial nature, given by sums over certain labelled ordered rooted trees.</description>
