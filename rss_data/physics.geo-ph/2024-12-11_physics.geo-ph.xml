      <title>Geological and Well prior assisted full waveform inversion using conditional diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) often faces challenges due to inadequate seismic observations, resulting in band-limited and geologically inaccurate inversion results. Incorporating prior information from potential velocity distributions, well-log information, and our geological knowledge and expectations can significantly improve FWI convergence to a realistic model. While diffusion-regularized FWI has shown improved performance compared to conventional FWI by incorporating the velocity distribution prior, it can benefit even more by incorporating well-log information and other geological knowledge priors. To leverage this fact, we propose a geological class and well-information prior-assisted FWI using conditional diffusion models. This method seamlessly integrates multi-modal information into FWI, simultaneously achieving data fitting and universal geologic and geophysics prior matching, which is often not achieved with traditional regularization methods. Specifically, we propose to combine conditional diffusion models with FWI, where we integrate well-log data and geological class conditions into these conditional diffusion models using classifier-free guidance for multi-modal prior matching beyond the original velocity distribution prior. Numerical experiments on the OpenFWI datasets and field marine data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional FWI and the unconditional diffusion-regularized FWI.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>GenAI4UQ: A Software for Inverse Uncertainty Quantification Using Conditional Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GenAI4UQ, a software package for inverse uncertainty quantification in model calibration, parameter estimation, and ensemble forecasting in scientific applications. GenAI4UQ leverages a generative artificial intelligence (AI) based conditional modeling framework to address the limitations of traditional inverse modeling techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. By replacing computationally intensive iterative processes with a direct, learned mapping, GenAI4UQ enables efficient calibration of model input parameters and generation of output predictions directly from observations. The software's design allows for rapid ensemble forecasting with robust uncertainty quantification, while maintaining high computational and storage efficiency. GenAI4UQ simplifies the model training process through built-in auto-tuning of hyperparameters, making it accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. Its conditional generative framework ensures versatility, enabling applicability across a wide range of scientific domains. At its core, GenAI4UQ transforms the paradigm of inverse modeling by providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution. It empowers researchers and practitioners to quickly estimate parameter distributions and generate model predictions for new observations, facilitating efficient decision-making and advancing the state of uncertainty quantification in computational modeling.

      <title>Tides on Lava Worlds: Application to Close-in Exoplanets and the Early Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of Solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: The tidal history of the early Earth-Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact; and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early Lunar recession to ${\sim} 25$ Earth radii within $10^4{-} 10^5$ years, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin-orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin-orbit resonances and accelerating their track towards tidal synchronization from a Gyr to Myr timescale. Moreover, we re-evaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</description>

      <title>Efficient pore space characterization based on the curvature of the distance map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Media classification and the construction of pore network models from binary images of porous media hinges on accurately characterizing the pore space. We present an efficient method for (i) locating critical points, that is, pore body and throat centers, and (ii) partitioning of the pore space using information on the curvature of the distance map (DM) of the binary image. Specifically, we use the local maxima and minima of the determinant map of the Hessian matrix of the DM to locate the center of pore bodies and throats. The locating step provides structural information on the pore system, such as pore body and throat size distributions and the mean coordination number. The partitioning step is based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian, rather than the DM, to characterize the pore space using either watershed or medial axis transforms. This strategy eliminates the common problem of saddle-induced over-partitioning shared by all traditional marker-based watershed methods and represents an efficient method to determine the skeleton of the pore space without the need for morphological reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large models, or foundation models, have exhibited remarkable performance, profoundly impacting research paradigms in diverse domains. Foundation models, trained on extensive and diverse datasets, provide exceptional generalization abilities, allowing for their straightforward application across various use cases and domains. Exploration geophysics is the study of the Earth's subsurface to find natural resources and help with environmental and engineering projects. It uses methods like analyzing seismic, magnetic, and electromagnetic data, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for the development of geophysical foundation models (GeoFMs). This perspective explores the potential applications and future research directions of GeoFMs in exploration geophysics. We also review the development of foundation models, including large language models, large vision models, and large multimodal models, as well as their advancement in the field of geophysics. Furthermore, we discuss the hierarchy of GeoFMs for exploration geophysics and the critical techniques employed, providing a foundational research workflow for their development. Lastly, we summarize the challenges faced in developing GeoFMs, along with future trends and their potential impact on the field. In conclusion, this perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the development, hierarchy, applications, development workflow, and challenges of foundation models, highlighting their transformative potential in advancing exploration geophysics.</description>
