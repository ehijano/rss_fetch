      <title>Loop-string-hadron approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory: Gauge invariant Hilbert space of a trivalent vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of gauge invariant states of SU(3) lattice gauge theories has garnered new interest in recent years, but implementing them is complicated by the need for SU(3) Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. In the loop-string-hadron (LSH) approach to lattice gauge theories, the elementary excitations are strictly gauge invariant, and constructing the basis requires no knowledge of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients. Originally developed for SU(2), the LSH formulation was recently generalized to SU(3), but limited to one spatial dimension. In this work, we generalize the LSH approach to constructing the basis of SU(3) gauge invariant states at a trivalent vertex - the essential building block to multidimensional space. A direct generalization from the SU(2) vertex yields a legitimate basis; however, in certain sectors of the Hilbert space, the naive LSH basis vectors so defined suffer from being nonorthogonal. The issues with orthogonality are directly related to the `missing label' or `outer multiplicity' problem associated with SU(3) tensor products, and may also be phrased in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients or the need for a `seventh Casimir' operator. The states that are unaffected by the problem are orthonormalized in closed form. For the sectors that are afflicted, we discuss the nonorthogonal bases and their orthogonalization. A few candidates for seventh Casimir operators are readily constructed from the suite of LSH gauge-singlet operators. The diagonalization of a seventh Casimir represents one prescriptive solution towards obtaining a complete orthonormal basis, but a closed-form general solution remains to be found.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay in a finite volume from relativistic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19695v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay process $nn\rightarrow ppee$ within the light Majorana-exchange scenario is studied using the relativistic pionless effective field theory (EFT) in finite-volume cubic boxes with the periodic boundary conditions. Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables from lattice QCD available at $m_\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted with a precision of 10\%-20\% and their volume dependence is investigated. This is possible thanks to the fact that the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be properly renormalized in the relativistic pionless EFT without the uncertain $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ contact term, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case. The predictions for the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly matched to the LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses. Therefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the benchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the predictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Formulation of Compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory is a topological quantum field theory with numerous applications in condensed matter and high-energy physics, including the study of anomalies, fermion/boson dualities, and the fractional quantum Hall effect. In this work, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, and the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the electromagnetic properties of the $ D^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically explore their electromagnetic characteristics to improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying the complex and controversial nature of multiquark systems. In this study, the magnetic dipole moments of $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks are extracted, which are directly related to the inner organization of the relevant states. The magnetic dipole moments of these states have been evaluated employing the QCD light-cone sum rules technique with isospin spin-parity $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ and $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$, for $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks respectively. Our predictions for the magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 2.98^{+0.76}_{-0.54}~\mu_N$ for the $ D \Sigma_c$ pentaquark, $\mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 1.65^{+0.45}_{-0.34}~\mu_N$ for the $D\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark, and $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -3.63^{+0.79}_{-0.60}~\mu_N$ for the $D^*\Sigma_c$ pentaquark. Furthermore, we have also extracted the electric quadrupole and the magnetic octupole moments of the $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks. These values show a non-spherical charge distribution. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic dipole moments of the doubly-charmed pentaquarks, in conjunction with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these intriguing pentaquarks, will prove valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in elucidating the internal structure of these pentaquarks.</description>
