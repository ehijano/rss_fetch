      <title>Electron transport in disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport in disordered systems often occurs via the variable range hopping (VRH) in the dilute carrier density limit, where electrons hop between randomly distributed localized levels. We study the nonequilibrium transport by a uniform DC electric field on a one-dimensional insulating tight-binding chain with the on-site disorder, using a finite-lattice calculation and the coherent potential approximation. We develop a theory of electric-field-assisted variable range hopping as a mechanism for nonlinear transport in a disordered chain. Our finite-lattice calculations of the electron propagation distance and the electron mobility determine the range of the variable range hopping as $\Delta &lt; W \lesssim 2\Delta$ in the gap $\Delta$. We further propose a nonlinear scaling of the conductivity by an electric field that is similar to Mott's variable range hopping in equilibrium. The nonlinear conductivity of an electronic lattice model follows the scaling law $\sigma(E) \propto \exp[-(E_0/E)^{\nu}]$ with the exponent $\nu = 1/3$ in one dimension for the VRH. We also discuss the experimental relevance of temperature-dependent nonlinear current-voltage relation.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected synchronization in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations of these), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the inner part of the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes play the role of independent pacemakers.</description>

      <title>Random quantum Ising model with three-spin couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a real-space block renormalization group approach to study the critical properties of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain with multispin interactions. First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Energy-Sensitive Universal Conductance Fluctuations in Anisotropic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuation (UCF) is a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</description>

      <title>Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Learning to Integrate in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to remember over long timescales is fundamentally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While much prior work has explored why RNNs struggle to learn long timescales and how to mitigate this, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics involved when RNNs learn long timescales via gradient descent. Here we build a mathematical theory of the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained to integrate white noise. We show that when the initial recurrent weights are small, the dynamics of learning are described by a low-dimensional system that tracks a single outlier eigenvalue of the recurrent weights. This reveals the precise manner in which the long timescale associated with white noise integration is learned. We extend our analyses to RNNs learning a damped oscillatory filter, and find rich dynamical equations for the evolution of a conjugate pair of outlier eigenvalues. Taken together, our analyses build a rich mathematical framework for studying dynamical learning problems salient for both machine learning and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>
