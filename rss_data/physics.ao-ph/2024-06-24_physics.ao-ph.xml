      <title>Machine Learning Global Simulation of Nonlocal Gravity Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global climate models typically operate at a grid resolution of hundreds of kilometers and fail to resolve atmospheric mesoscale processes, e.g., clouds, precipitation, and gravity waves (GWs). Model representation of these processes and their sources is essential to the global circulation and planetary energy budget, but subgrid scale contributions from these processes are often only approximately represented in models using parameterizations. These parameterizations are subject to approximations and idealizations, which limit their capability and accuracy. The most drastic of these approximations is the "single-column approximation" which completely neglects the horizontal evolution of these processes, resulting in key biases in current climate models. With a focus on atmospheric GWs, we present the first-ever global simulation of atmospheric GW fluxes using machine learning (ML) models trained on the WINDSET dataset to emulate global GW emulation in the atmosphere, as an alternative to traditional single-column parameterizations. Using an Attention U-Net-based architecture trained on globally resolved GW momentum fluxes, we illustrate the importance and effectiveness of global nonlocality, when simulating GWs using data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>Deformation monitoring with Sentinel-1 Wave mode data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the salient characteristics of Sentinel-1 wave (WV) mode vignettes. We describe our approach for working with WV mode data that enables vignette-based data access and processing, thereby eliminating the Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) data packaging and current archive metadata conventions as a bottleneck to large scale processing. We discuss the spatial and temporal coverage of Sentinel-1 WV mode data and show that a large volume of data has been acquired over land masses in this mode, thus allowing us to use it for land monitoring applications as well as ocean applications. For targeted infrastructure monitoring studies, we are able to generate coregistered, geocoded stacks of WV mode SLCs for any area of interest (AOI) with sufficient wave mode coverage, in a few minutes. We demonstrate the applicability of using WV mode data for deformation monitoring applications. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of working with Sentinel-1 WV mode data.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Emulation of a Global Climate Model with Spherical DYffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning models are on the verge of transforming global weather forecasting. It is an open question if this success can extend to climate modeling, where long inference rollouts and data complexity pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first conditional generative model able to produce global climate ensemble simulations that are accurate and physically consistent. Our model runs at 6-hourly time steps and is shown to be stable for 10-year-long simulations. Our approach beats relevant baselines and nearly reaches a gold standard for successful climate model emulation. We discuss the key design choices behind our dynamics-informed diffusion model-based approach which enables this significant step towards efficient, data-driven climate simulations that can help us better understand the Earth and adapt to a changing climate.</description>

      <title>SFY -- A lightweight, high-frequency and phase-resolving wave-buoy for coastal waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small lightweight wave buoys, SFYs, designed to operate near the coast, have been developed. The buoys are designed to record and transmit the full time series of surface acceleration at $52$ Hz. The buoy uses the cellular network to transfer data and position (up to $80$ km from the base station). This reduces costs and increases band-width. The low cost and low weight permits the buoys to be deployed easily, and in arrays in areas where satellite and wave models struggle to resolve wave and current interaction. The buoys are tested in a wave-flume, the open water and in the breaking waves of the surf. The conditions range from calm to significant wave heights exceeding $7$ m and crashing breakers with accelerations exceeding $10$ g. The high sample rate captures the impulse of breaking waves, and allows them to be studied in detail. Breaking waves are measured and quantified in the open water. We measure breaking waves in the surf and recover the trajectory of waves breaking in the field to a higher degree than previously done. The time series of surface elevation, and accurate positioning, permits the signal of adjacent buoys to be correlated in a coherent phase-resolved way. Finally, we offer an explanation and solution for the ubiquitous low-frequency noise in IMU-based buoys and discuss necessary sampling and design to measure in areas of breaking waves.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Radar Observing System Simulation Experiment in the Western Mediterranean Sea: a Lagrangian assessment approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of the expansion of a high-frequency radar (HFR) system in a dynamic coastal area (the Ibiza Channel in the Western Mediterranean Sea) is evaluated through an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The installation of two new antennas in the Iberian Peninsula would complement the existing ones in the islands of Ibiza and Formentera, providing surface currents observations of the full channel. Two different configurations of the same model, validated to give realistic simulations, are used: i) a Nature Run (NR) which is considered as the real ocean state and that is used to generate pseudo-observations, and ii) a Control Run (CR) in which the pseudo-observations are assimilated. The OSSE is first validated by comparison against a previous Observing System Experiment (OSE). The impact of the new antennas for forecasting surface currents is evaluated in two different periods with different levels of agreement between NR and CR. The HFR expansion is found to contribute to significantly correct the circulation patterns in the Channel, leading to surface merdional velocity error reductions up to 19%. The effects on the transport in the area are also analyzed from a Lagrangian perspective, showing that DA can help to better represent the Lagrangian Coherent Structures present in the NR and constrain the ocean dynamics.</description>
