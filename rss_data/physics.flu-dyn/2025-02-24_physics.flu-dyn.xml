      <title>A Quasi-Analytical Solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" Shear-thinning Fluids Flowing in Slightly Tapered Pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quasi-analytical framework for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids with a viscosity characterized by two constant plateau at low and high shear rates connected by a shear-thinning branch, and flowing in slightly tapered pipes. This setup is common in research and industrial applications since the last century, by assuming both a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian inelastic behaviour. Nevertheless, an analytical solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids is still lacking. The expressions have been derived by using the order-of-magnitude analysis and neglecting the inertial terms in the momentum balance equations. The analytical solutions are employed to an extrusion bioprinting process as an application example, and verified through numerical procedures.</description>

      <title>Bispectral decomposition and energy transfer in a turbulent jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ bispectral mode decomposition (BMD) to investigate coherent triadic interactions and nonlinear energy transfer in a subsonic turbulent jet. BMD extracts the flow structures corresponding to the dominant triadic interactions. We find a strong triadic correlation among the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket, its conjugate, and the streaks. The most energetic streaks occur at the azimuthal wavenumber $m=2$, with the dominant contributing azimuthal wavenumber triad being $[m_1,m_2,m_3]=[1,1,2]$. The spectral energy budget reveals that nonlinear triadic interactions represent an energy loss to the streaks. Analysis across a wide range of frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers identifies the direction of nonlinear energy transfer and the spatial regions where these transfers are most active. The turbulent jet exhibits a forward energy cascade in a global sense, though the direction of energy transfer varies locally. In the shear layer near the nozzle exit, triadic interactions between relatively smaller scales are dominant, leading to an inverse energy cascade. Farther downstream, beyond the end of the potential core, triadic interactions between larger scales dominate, resulting in a forward energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Environmental Co-design: Fish-Blade Collision Model for Hydrokinetic Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in the deployment of hydrokinetic turbines in aquatic environments is the risk of fish collisions. Traditional fish collision models often oversimplify this risk by neglecting critical factors, such as the thickness of the turbine and accessory structures. Additionally, variations in fish size and species are frequently overlooked. This study addresses these gaps by developing a swimming mechanics-based fish-blade collision model. Using a Lagrangian particle tracking approach, we simulate fish movements and evaluate collision risks with a representative hydrokinetic turbine, both with and without ducts. The model is applied to the velocity field at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, allowing for the assessment of collision risks across different fish species. The results offer valuable insights for turbine siting, optimization of turbine placement, and evaluation of protective designs to reduce environmental impacts in complex flow environments.</description>

      <title>Looking at bare transport coefficients in fluctuating hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics at the macroscopic scale, composed of a vast ensemble of microscopic particles, is described by the Navier-Stokes equation. However, at the mesoscopic scale, bridging the microscopic and macroscopic domains, fluctuations become significant, necessitating the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics for accurate descriptions. A central feature of this framework is the appearance of noises and transport coefficients, referred to as bare transport coefficients. These coefficients, generally different from the macroscopic transport coefficients of the deterministic Navier-Stokes equation, are challenging to measure directly because macroscopic measurements typically yield the latter coefficients. This paper addresses the questions of how bare transport coefficients manifest in measurable physical quantities and how practical methodologies can be developed for their determination. As a prototype example, we examine the shear viscosity of two-dimensional dense fluids. The numerical simulations of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations reveal that near solid walls, where hydrodynamic fluctuations are significantly suppressed, the bare shear viscosity governs the fluid dynamics. The theoretical calculations, based on perturbation expansion of the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations, confirm this suppression of hydrodynamic fluctuations at walls and yield analytical expressions for the observed shear viscosity. Based on this finding, we develop a methodology to accurately determine the bare shear viscosity using a controlled shear flow. Furthermore, we provide detailed numerical investigations of the role of an ultraviolet cutoff length in fluctuating hydrodynamics. These establish that the lower bound of the ultraviolet cutoff length is on the order of atomic diameter and highlight that bare viscosity is determined solely by microscopic details below this scale.</description>

      <title>Short term vs. long term: optimization of microswimmer navigation on different time horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use reinforcement learning to find strategies that allow microswimmers in turbulence to avoid regions of large strain. This question is motivated by the hypothesis that swimming microorganisms tend to avoid such regions to minimise the risk of predation. We ask which local cues a microswimmer must measure to efficiently avoid such straining regions. We find that it can succeed without directional information, merely by measuring the magnitude of the local strain. However, the swimmer avoids straining regions more efficiently if it can measure the sign of local strain gradients. We compare our results with those of an earlier study [Mousavi {\em et al.} Phys. Rev. Res. {\bf 6}, L022034 (2024)] where a short-time expansion was used to find optimal strategies. We find that the short-time strategies work well in some cases but not in others. We derive a new theory that explains when the time-horizon matters for our optimisation problem, and when it does not. We find the strategy with best performance when the time-horizon coincides with the correlation time of the turbulent fluctuations. We also explain how the update frequency (the frequency at which the swimmer updates its strategy) affects the found strategies. We find that higher update frequencies yield better performance.</description>

      <title>Drag reduction in surfactant-contaminated superhydrophobic channels at high P\'eclet numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by microfluidic applications, we investigate drag reduction in laminar pressure-driven flows in channels with streamwise-periodic superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) contaminated with soluble surfactant. We develop a model in the long-wave and weak-diffusion limit, where the streamwise SHS period is large compared to the channel height and the P\'{e}clet number is large. Using asymptotic and numerical techniques, we determine the influence of surfactant on drag reduction in terms of the relative strength of advection, diffusion, Marangoni effects and bulk-surface exchange. In scenarios with strong exchange, the drag reduction exhibits a complex dependence on the thickness of the bulk-concentration boundary layer and surfactant strength. Strong Marangoni effects immobilise the interface through a linear surfactant distribution, whereas weak Marangoni effects yield a quasi-stagnant cap. The quasi-stagnant cap has an intricate structure with an upstream slip region, followed by intermediate inner regions, and a quasi-stagnant region that is mediated by weak bulk diffusion. The quasi-stagnant region differs from the immobile region of a classical stagnant cap, observed for instance in surfactant-laden air bubbles in water, by displaying weak slip. As exchange weakens, the bulk and interface decouple: the surfactant distribution is linear when the surfactant is strong, whilst it forms a classical stagnant cap when the surfactant is weak. The asymptotic solutions offer closed-form predictions of drag reduction across much of the parameter space, providing practical utility and enhancing understanding of surfactant dynamics in flows over SHSs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking of turbulent flow due to asymmetric vortex shedding in periodic porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we report new insight into a symmetry-breaking phenomenon that occurs for turbulent flow in periodic porous media composed of cylindrical solid obstacles with circular cross-section. We have used Large Eddy Simulation to investigate the symmetry-breaking phenomenon by varying the porosity (0.57-0.99) and the pore scale Reynolds number (37-1,000). Asymmetrical flow distribution is observed in the intermediate porosity flow regime for values of porosities between 0.8 and 0.9, which is characterized by the formation of alternating low and high velocity flow channels above and below the solid obstacles. These channels are parallel to the direction of the flow. Correspondingly, the microscale vortices formed behind the solid obstacles exhibit a bias in the shedding direction. The transition from symmetric to asymmetric flow occurs in between the Reynolds numbers of 37 (laminar) and 100 (turbulent). A Hopf bifurcation resulting in unsteady oscillatory laminar flow marks the origin of a secondary flow instability arising from the interaction of the shear layers around the solid obstacle. When turbulence emerges, stochastic phase difference in the vortex wake oscillations caused by the secondary flow instability results in flow symmetry breaking. We note that symmetry breaking does not occur for cylindrical solid obstacles with square cross-section due to the presence of sharp vertices in the solid obstacle surface. At the macroscale level, symmetry-breaking results in residual transverse drag force components acting on the solid obstacle surfaces. Symmetry-breaking promotes attached flow on the solid obstacle surface, which is potentially beneficial for improving transport properties at the solid obstacle surface such as convection heat flux.</description>

      <title>Error propagation of direct pressure gradient integration and a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition based pressure field reconstruction method for image velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering pressure fields from image velocimetry measurements has two general strategies: i) directly integrating the pressure gradients from the momentum equation and ii) solving or enforcing the pressure Poisson equation (divergence of the pressure gradients). In this work, we analyze the error propagation of the former strategy and provide some practical insights. For example, we establish the error scaling laws for the Pressure Gradient Integration (PGI) and the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE). We explain why applying the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) could significantly reduce the error propagation for the PGI. We also propose to use a novel HHD-based pressure field reconstruction strategy that offers the following advantages or features: i) effective processing of noisy scattered or structured image velocimetry data on a complex domain; ii) using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) with divergence/curl-free kernels to provide divergence-free correction to the velocity fields for incompressible flows and curl-free correction for pressure gradients; and iii) enforcing divergence/curl-free constraints without using Lagrangian multipliers. Complete elimination of divergence-free bias in measured pressure gradient and curl-free bias in the measured velocity field results in superior accuracy. Synthetic velocimetry data based on exact solutions and high-fidelity simulations are used to validate the analysis as well as demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the RBF-HHD solver.</description>

      <title>Evaporating sessile droplets: solutal Marangoni effects overwhelm thermal Marangoni flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an evaporating water droplet is deposited on a thermally conductive substrate, the minimum temperature will be at the apex due to evaporative cooling. Consequently, density and surface tension gradients emerge within the droplet and at the droplet-gas interface, giving rise to competing flows from, respectively, the apex towards the contact line (thermal-buoyancy-driven flow) and the other way around (thermal Marangoni flow). In small droplets with a diameter below the capillary length, the thermal Marangoni effects are expected to dominate over thermal buoyancy ("thermal Rayleigh") effects. However, contrary to these theoretical predictions, our experiments mostly show a dominant circulation from the apex towards the contact line, indicating a prevailing of thermal Rayleigh convection. Furthermore, our experiments often show an unexpected asymmetric flow that persisted for several minutes. We hypothesise that a tiny amount of contaminants, commonly encountered in experiments with water/air interfaces, act as surfactants and counteract the thermal surface tension gradients at the interface and thereby promote the dominance of Rayleigh convection. Our finite element numerical simulations demonstrate that, under our specified experimental conditions, a mere 0.5% reduction in the static surface tension caused by surfactants leads to a reversal in the flow direction, compared to the theoretical prediction without contaminants. Additionally, we investigate the linear stability of the axisymmetric solutions, revealing that the presence of surfactants also affects the axial symmetry of the flow.</description>

      <title>Refined radial basis function-generated finite difference analysis of non-Newtonian natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a refined Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) solution for a non-Newtonian fluid in a closed differentially heated cavity. The non-Newtonian behaviour is modelled with the Ostwald-de Waele power law and the buoyancy with the Boussinesq approximation. The problem domain is discretised with scattered nodes without any requirement for a topological relation between them. This allows a trivial generalisation of the solution procedure to complex irregular three dimensional (3D) domains, which is also demonstrated by solving the problem in a two dimensional (2D) and 3D geometry mimicking a porous filter. The results in 2D are compared with two reference solutions that use the Finite volume method in a conjunction with two different stabilisation techniques, where we achieved good agreement with the reference data. The refinement is implemented on top of a dedicated meshless node positioning algorithm using piecewise linear node density function that ensures sufficient node density in the centre of the domain while maximising the node density in a boundary layer where the most intense dynamic is expected. The results show that with a refined approach, more than 5 times fewer nodes are required to obtain the results with the same accuracy compared to the regular discretisation. The paper also discusses the convergence with refined discretisation for different scenarios for up to $2 \cdot 10^5$ nodes, the impact of method parametres, the behaviour of the flow in the boundary layer, the behaviour of the viscosity and the geometric flexibility of the proposed solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have been successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. \textit{Equilibrium field theory} describes thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation, where the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, \textit{nonequilibrium field theory} is employed for modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity. In HDT, viscosity renormalization yields wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, I cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>
