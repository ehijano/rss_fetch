      <title>Enriching the Felsenthal index with a priori unions for decision-making processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the domain of game theory, power indexes are defined as functions that quantify the influence of individual participants in collective decision-making processes. Felsenthal [D. Felsenthal. A Well-Behaved Index of a Priori P-Power for Simple N-Person Games. Homo Oeconomicus, 33, 2016] proposed a power index with a focus on least size winning coalitions, i.e., those coalitions capable of determining the final outcome and with the smallest number of players among all winning coalitions. However, the Felsenthal index overlooks pre-existing affinities between the players, a common and impactful factor in real-world political and economic contexts. This paper introduces the Felsenthal Owen power index, a novel index based on Felsenthal's approach that integrates player affinities using Owen's a priori unions framework. The new index is rigorously characterised by two distinct sets of axiomatic properties. We demonstrate its practical utility by applying it to the International Monetary Fund's voting system, revealing how strategic alliances significantly reshape power distributions. The index thus offers policymakers a more sophisticated tool for measuring influence in complex decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Money and Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We divide efficiently a pile of indivisible goods in common property, using cash transfers to ensure fairness among agents with utility linear in money. We compare three cognitively feasible and privacy preserving division rules in terms of the guarantees (worst case utility) they offer to the participants. In the first version of Divide &amp; Choose to n agents, they bid for the role of Divider then everyone bids on the shares of the Divider's partition. In the second version each agent announces a partition and they all bid to select the most efficient one. In the Bid &amp; Sell rule the agents bid for the role of Seller: with two agents the smallest bid defines the Seller who then charges any price constrained only by her winning bid. Both rules reward subadditive utilities and penalise superadditive ones, and B&amp;S more so than both D&amp;C-s. B&amp;S is also better placed to collect a larger share of the surplus when agents play safe.</description>

      <title>Compatibility between Stability and Strategy-Proofness: A Single-Peaked Preferences Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-sided matching markets, ensuring both stability and strategy-proofness poses a significant challenge; it is impossible when agents' preferences are unrestricted. But what if agents' preferences have specific restricted structures? Such scenarios frequently arise in real-world applications. This study explores the possibility of achieving both stability and strategy-proofness by focusing on scenarios where agents' preferences follow a structured pattern called single-peakedness.
  We focus on the simplest case - the well-known marriage problem, which is a one-to-one matching market. Despite its simplicity, this model is a useful starting point for exploration in many cases. Our main contribution is identifying all single-peaked subdomains on which stability and (weak/strong group) strategy-proofness are compatible, which we present through two key results. The first one characterizes all single-peaked subdomains with stable and (weakly group) strategy-proof matching rules, and identifies such a matching rule on these domains. The second one is an impossibility result that shows the incompatibility between stability and strong group strategy-proofness on single-peaked subdomains.</description>

      <title>Fair Division with Bounded Sharing: Binary and Non-Degenerate Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of objects is to be divided fairly among agents with different tastes, modeled by additive utility-functions. If we consider the objects as indivisible, many instances of the decision problem: ``Is there a fair division of the objects among the agents'' are negative. In addition, this question is hard to solve even for most of the special cases. The latter reasons give us a good motivation to relax the problem for which the running time complexity is better, and the number of positive instances (admitting a fair division) will significantly grow. Whereas many works relax the fairness criteria, this paper introduces another relaxation: an agent is allowed to share a \emph{bounded} number of objects between two or more agents in order to attain fairness. The paper studies various notions of fairness, such as proportionality, envy-freeness, equitability, and consensus. We analyze the run-time complexity of finding a fair allocation with a given number of sharings under several restrictions on the agents' valuations, such as: binary, generalized-binary, and non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Approximately Fair and Population Consistent Budget Division via Simple Payment Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In approval-based budget division, a budget needs to be distributed to candidates based on the voters' approval ballots over these candidates. In the pursuit of a simple, consistent, and approximately fair rule for this setting, we introduce the maximum payment rule (MP). Under this rule, each voter controls a part of the budget and, in each step, the corresponding voters allocate their entire budget to the candidate approved by the largest number of voters with non-zero budget. We show that MP meets our criteria as it satisfies monotonicity and a demanding population consistency condition and gives a $2$-approximation to a fairness notion called average fair share (AFS). Moreover, we generalize MP to the class of sequential payment rule and prove that it is the most desirable rule in this class: all sequential payment rules but MP and one other rule fail monotonicity while only allowing for a small improvement in the approximation ratio to AFS.</description>
