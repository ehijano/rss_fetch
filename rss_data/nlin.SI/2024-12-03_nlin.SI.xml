      <title>Exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates are placed in the context of the inverse scattering transform. We show that the exponential double-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum, whereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves the long-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in the spectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain the exponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with the reflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in each quadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, we consider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degenerates into a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Integrability of a Generalized Camassa-Holm Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation from the perspective of integrability. Using the framework developed by Dubrovin on bi-Hamiltonian deformations and the general theory of quasi-integrability, we demonstrate that a unique bi-Hamiltonian structure is possible for this generalized equation only when it reduces to the original CH equation.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>

      <title>On existence and properties of roots of third Painlev\'e' transcendents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A closed proof of existence of solutions to third Painlev\'e' equation (Painlev\'e' transcendents) vanishing at arbitrary given point except zero is presented. The structure of the set of Painlev\'e' transcendents with common parameters vanishing at a given point is described. The approximate explicit representation of a Painlev\'e' transcendent in vicinity of its non-zero root is given.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary dispersion and potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian representation of isomonodromic deformations of twisted rational connections: The Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>
