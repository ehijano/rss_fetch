      <title>Liquid-Liquid Equilibria for Systems Containing 4-Phenylbutan-2-one or Benzyl Ethanoate and Selected Alkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) phase diagrams have been determined, by means of the critical opalescence method with a laser scattering technique, for the mixtures 4-phenylbutan-2-one + CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_n$CH$_3$ ($n = 10,12,14$) and for benzyl ethanoate + CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_n$CH$_3$ ($n = 12,14$). The systems are characterized by having an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which increases with n. The corresponding LLE curves show a rather horizontal top and become skewed toward higher mole fractions of the polar compound when n is increased. Calorimetric and LLE measurements show that, for mixtures with molecules with a given functional group, interactions between aromatic molecules are stronger than those between homomorphic linear molecules (aromaticity effect). This has been ascribed to proximity effects arising from the presence of the polar group and the aromatic ring within the same molecule. Proximity effects become weaker in the sequence 1-phenylpropan-2-one &gt; 4-phenylbutan-2-one &gt; 1-phenylethanone and are more important in benzyl ethanoate than in ethyl benzoate molecules. Values of the critical compositions and temperatures calculated with the DISQUAC group contribution model are in good agreement with the experimental results. Accordingly, the shape of the LLE curves is also correctly described by DISQUAC.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced molecular growth of benzonitrile in the gas phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the absorption of high energetic ultraviolet (UV) photons by the surface layers of the cold molecular clouds, only low energetic photons are able to penetrate into the inner regions of these clouds. This leads to lower photo-ionization yield of molecules of higher ionization potential in these environments. However, here we have experimentally shown the ionization of Benzonitrile molecule using 266nm (4.66eV) photons. The low intensity and unfocused laser irradiation of benzonitrile molecules results extensive fragmentation. Moreover, the ion-neutral reactions among the cationic fragments and neutral fragments shows promising molecular mass growth.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and Spectroscopy of H$_2$ in Myoglobin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusional dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in myoglobin (Mb) is characterized. Hydrogen has been implicated in a number of physiologically relevant processes, including cellular aging or inflammation. Here, the internal diffusion through the protein matrix was characterized and the vibrational spectroscopy was investigated using conventional empirical energy functions and improved models able to describe higher-order electrostatic moments of the ligand. H$_2$ can occupy the same internal defects as already found for Xe or CO (Xe1 to Xe4 and B-state). Furthermore, 4 additional sites were found, some of which had been discovered in earlier simulation studies. The vibrational spectra using the most refined energy function indicate that depending on the docking site the spectroscopy of H$_2$ differs. The maxima of the absorption spectra cover $\sim 20$ cm$^{-1}$ which are indicative of a pronounced effect of the surrounding protein matrix on the vibrational spectroscopy of the ligand. Electronic structure calculations show that H$_2$ forms a stable complex with the heme-iron (stabilized by $\sim -12$ kcal/mol) but splitting of H$_2$ is unlikely due to a high activation energy ($\sim 50$ kcal/mol).</description>

      <title>Exact analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watkzy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Finke-Watkzy model is the reaction set consisting of autocatalysis, A + B --&gt; 2B and the first order process A --&gt; B. It has been widely used to describe phenomena as diverse as the formation of transition metal nanoparticles and protein misfolding and aggregation. It can also be regarded as a simple model for the spread of a non-fatal but incurable disease. The deterministic rate equations for this reaction set are easy to solve and the solution is used in the literature to fit experimental data. However, some applications of the Finke-Watkzy model may involve systems with a small number of molecules or individuals. In such cases, a stochastic description using a Chemical Master Equation or Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is more appropriate than a deterministic one. This is even more so because for this particular set of chemical reactions, the differences between deterministic and stochastic kinetics can be very significant. Here, we derive an analytical solution of the Chemical Master Equation for the Finke-Watkzy model. We consider both the original formulation of the model, where the reactions are assumed to be irreversible, and its generalization to the case of reversible reactions. For the former, we obtain analytical expressions for the time dependence of the probabilities of the number of A molecules. For the latter, we derive the corresponding steady-state probability distribution. Our findings may have implications for modeling the spread of epidemics and chemical reactions in living cells.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Non-Equilibrium Atom-Diatom Collisional Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The change of the vibrational energy within a molecule after collisions with another molecule plays an essential role in the evolution of molecular internal energy distributions, which is also the limiting process in the relaxation of the gas towards equilibrium. Here we investigate the energy transfer between the translational motion and the vibrational motion of the diatom during the atom-diatom collision, the simplest case involving the transfer between inter-molecular and intra-molecular energies. We are interested in the situation when the translational temperature of the gas is high, in which case there are significant probabilities for the vibrational energy to change over widely separated energy levels after a collision. Data from quasi-classical trajectory simulations of the N+N$_2$ system with \textit{ab initio} potential energies suggest that the transition probability dependence on the collisional energy possesses an ``activation-saturation'' behavior and can be described by a simple model. The model allows for explicit evaluation of the vibrational state-to-state transition rate coefficients, from which the evolution of the vibrational energy distribution from any initial conditions can be solved by the master equation approach. An example of the vibrational energy relaxation in the N+N$_2$ system mimicking the gas behind strong shocks in a hypersonic flow is shown and the results are in good agreement with available data.</description>

      <title>The connection of polaritonic chemistry with the physics of a spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed electronic structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the iconic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability in the dressed electronic structure (spontaneous replica symmetry breaking), which could provide the long-sought seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. This mapping paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as frustration, aging dynamics, excess of thermal fluctuations, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the mapping also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems and it suggests novel theoretical directions such as polarization glasses with explicitly time-dependent order parameter functions.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic control of blackbody infrared radiative dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational strong light-matter coupling offers a promising approach for controlling chemical reactivity with infrared microcavities. This study explores the dynamics of Blackbody Infrared Radiative Dissociation (BIRD) in microcavities under weak and strong light-matter interaction regimes. Using a Master equation approach, we simulate the effects of infrared field confinement and vibrational strong coupling on BIRD rates for diatomic molecules. We present a framework explaining how infrared microcavities influence BIRD kinetics, highlighting the importance of overtone transitions in the process. Our findings reveal conditions for significant enhancement and mild suppression of radiative dissociation, establishing upper bounds for BIRD rates under weak and strong coupling. These results provide new strategies and limitations for controlling reactive processes with infrared resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance the understanding of air quality within underground railway stations (URS), a methodology has been developed to establish a baseline profile of particle concentrations (PM10 and PM2.5). This approach incorporates an extensive data cleaning process based on the identification of URS operation periods, physically inconsistent or mathematically aberrant data, and comparing the profile of each day to an average profile. The versatility of this methodology allows its application to different particle classes within various URS. The results obtained from the three studied URS indicate the possibility of obtaining reliable daily typical profiles even over short measurement periods (up to one or two weeks).</description>

      <title>Impact of Subsurface Oxygen on CO2 Charging Energy Changes in Cu Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsurface oxygen in oxide-derived copper catalysts significantly influences CO$_2$ activation. However, its effect on the molecular charging process, the key to forming the CO$_2^{\delta-}$ intermediate, remains poorly understood. We employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate the impact of the structural factors induced by the subsurface oxygen on charged activation of CO$_2$. By computing the molecular single-particle state energy of the electron-accepting orbital ($\sigma*$) on Cu (111) surface, we examined how this molecular quasi-particle (QP) energy changes with varied vicinity of adsorption and multiple subsurface oxygen configuration. We demonstrate that subsurface oxygen impairs CO$_2$ charging, with its presence and density being influential factors. The non-local potential proves substantial for accurate excitation energy predictions yet is not sensitive to minor atomic structural changes. More importantly, state delocalization and hybridization are critical for determining QP energy. These insights are enlightening for designing atomic architectures to optimize catalytic performance on modified surfaces.</description>

      <title>The ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first counter-example showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This property had been conjectured to hold for decades and it plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counter-example involves an external potential generated by six nuclei of small fractional charges, placed far away from each other. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is proved to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. In addition, we show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. Although the conjecture remains open for real nuclei (of integer charges), our work sets some doubt on the validity of the energy convexity for general atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Effects of quenched disorder on the kinetics and pathways of phase transition in a soft colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although impurities are unavoidable in real-world and experimental systems, most numerical studies on nucleation focus on pure (impurity-free) systems. As a result, the role of impurities in phase transitions remains poorly understood, especially for systems with complex free energy landscapes featuring one or more metastable intermediate phases. In this study, we employed Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the effects of static impurities (quenched disorder) of varying length scales and surface morphologies on the nucleation mechanism and kinetics in the Gaussian Core Model (GCM) system, a model for soft colloidal systems. We first explored how the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size are influenced by the fraction of pinned particles ($f_{\rm p}$) and the pinned cluster size ($n_{\rm p}$). Both the nucleation free energy barrier and critical cluster size increase sharply with increasing $f_{\rm p}$ but decrease as $n_{\rm p}$ grows, eventually approaching the homogeneous nucleation limit. On examining the impact of surface morphology on nucleation kinetics, we observed that the nucleation barrier significantly decreases with increasing the spherical pinned cluster (referred to as "seed") size of face-centred cubic (FCC), body-centred cubic (BCC), and simple cubic (SC) structures, with BCC showing the greatest facilitation. Interestingly, seeds with random surface roughness had little effect on nucleation kinetics. Additionally, the polymorphic identity of particles in the final crystalline phase is influenced by both seed surface morphology and system size. This study further provides crucial insights into the intricate relationship between substrate-induced local structural fluctuations and the selection of the polymorphic identity in the final crystalline phase, which is essential for understanding and controlling crystallization processes in experiments.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the speed of sound in gaseous cis-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoroprop-1-ene, (R1234ze(Z)), are presented. The measurements were performed using a quasi-spherical acoustic resonator at temperatures between 307 K and 420 K and pressures up to 1.8 MPa. Ideal-gas heat capacities and acoustic virial coefficients over the same temperature range were directly calculated from the results. The relative accuracy of our determinations of the speed of sound $w$($p$,$T$) of R1234ze(Z) was approximately $\pm$ 0.02%. The accuracy of the determination of the ideal gas heat capacity ratio ${\gamma}^{0}$($T$) was approximately $\pm$ 0.25%. These data were found to be mostly consistent with the predictions of a fundamental equation of state of R1234ze(Z).</description>

      <title>Classification of electronic structures and state preparation for quantum computation of reaction chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation for chemical problems will require the construction of guiding states with sufficient overlap with a target state. Since easily available and initializable mean-field states are characterized by an overlap that is reduced for multi-configurational electronic structures and even vanishes with growing system size, we here investigate the severity of state preparation for reaction chemistry. We emphasize weaknesses in current traditional approaches (even for weakly correlated molecules) and highlight the advantage of quantum phase estimation algorithms. An important result is the introduction of a new classification scheme for electronic structures based on orbital entanglement information. We identify two categories of multi-configurational molecules. Whereas class-1 molecules are dominated by very few determinants and often found in reaction chemistry, class-2 molecules do not allow one to single out a reasonably sized number of important determinants. The latter are particularly hard for traditional approaches and an ultimate target for quantum computation. Some open-shell iron-sulfur clusters belong to class 2. We discuss the role of the molecular orbital basis set and show that true class-2 molecules remain in this class independent of the choice of the orbital basis, with the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase being a prototypical example. We stress that class-2 molecules can be build in a systematic fashion from open-shell centers or unsaturated carbon atoms. Our key result is that it will always be possible to initialize a guiding state for chemical reaction chemistry in the ground state based on initial low-cost approximate electronic structure information, which is facilitated by the finite size of the atomistic structures to be considered.</description>

Abstract: The photochemical acid generation is refined from the first principles of quantum electrodynamics. First, we briefly review the formulation of the quantum theory of light based on the quantum electrodynamics framework to establish the probability of acid generation at a given spacetime point. The quantum-mechanical acid generation is then combined with the deprotection mechanism to obtain a probabilistic description of the deprotection density directly related to feature formation in a photoresist. A statistical analysis of the random deprotection density is presented to reveal the leading characteristics of stochastic feature formation.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Alchemical Integral Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently introduced the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) enabling the prediction of energy differences, and guessed an Ansatz to parametrize space $\pmb{r}$ in some alchemical change $\lambda$. Here, we present a rigorous derivation of AIT's kernel $\mathcal{K}$ and discuss the parametrization $\pmb{r}(\lambda)$ in $n$ dimensions, i.e. necessary conditions, mathematical freedoms and additional constraints when obtaining it. Analytical expressions for changes in energy spectra and densities are given for general systems. One-particle examples include quantum harmonic oscillator and hydrogen-like atom, i.e. (positive) homogeneous functions of degree $\nu \neq -2$ in $n$ dimensions, and finally one multi-particle system.</description>

      <title>How quickly can sodium-ion learn? Assessing scenarios for techno-economic competitiveness against lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we identify many sodium-ion pathways that might reach cost-competitiveness with low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains -- namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Alchemical insights into approximately quadratic energies of iso-electronic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanics based predictions of property trends are so important for materials design and discovery that even inexpensive approximate methods are valuable. We use the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) to study multi-electron atoms, and to gain a better understanding of the approximately quadratic behavior of energy differences between iso-electronic atoms in their nuclear charges. Based on this, we arrive at the following simple analytical estimate of energy differences between any two iso-electronic atoms, $\Delta E \approx -(1 + 2\gamma \sqrt{N_e-1})\,\Delta Z\, \bar{Z}$. Here, $\gamma \approx 0.3766 \pm 0.0020$ Ha corresponds to an empirical constant, and $N_e$, $\Delta Z$, and $\bar{Z}$ respectively to electron number, and nuclear charge difference and average. We compare the formula's predictive accuracy using experimental numbers and non-relativistic, numerical results obtained via DFT (pbe0) for the entire periodic table up to Radon. A detailed discussion of the atomic Helium-series is included.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric reconstruction of the Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$(0001) surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic properties of materials stem from fundamental atomic-scale details, yet for insulators, resolving surface structures remains a challenge. The basal (0001) plane of ${\alpha}$-Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ was imaged with noncontact atomic force microscopy with an atomically-defined tip apex. The surface forms a complex $({\sqrt31} {\times} {\sqrt31})R{\pm}9{\deg}$ reconstruction. The lateral positions of the individual O and Al surface atoms come directly from experiment; how these connect to the underlying crystal bulk was determined based on computational modeling. Before the restructuring, the surface Al atoms assume an unfavorable, threefold planar coordination; the reconstruction allows a rehybridization with subsurface O that leads to a substantial energy gain. The reconstructed surface remains stoichiometric, Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Manipulating crack formation in air-dried clay suspensions with tunable elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clay, the major ingredient of natural soils, is often used as a rheological modifier while formulating paints and coatings. When subjected to desiccation, colloidal clay suspensions and clayey soils crack due to the accumulation of drying-induced stresses. Even when desiccation is suppressed, aqueous clay suspensions exhibit physical aging, with their elastic and viscous moduli increasing over time as their microscopic structures evolve due to time-dependent inter-particle screened electrostatic interactions. The rate at which aging progresses is estimated from the rate of evolution of the mechanical moduli and can be controlled by changing clay concentration or by incorporating additives. Since physical aging and evaporation should both contribute to the consolidation of drying clay suspensions, we attempt to manipulate the desiccation process \textit{via} alterations of clay and additive concentrations. For a desiccating sample with an accelerated rate of aging, we observe faster consolidation into a semi-solid state and earlier onset of cracks. We estimate the crack onset time, $t_c$, in direct visualization experiments and the elasticity of the drying sample layer, $E$, using microindentation in an atomic force microscope. We demonstrate that $t_c \propto \sqrt{\frac{G_c}{E}}$, where $G_c$, the fracture energy, is estimated by fitting our experimental data to a linear poroelastic model that incorporates the Griffith's criterion for crack formation. Our work demonstrates that early crack onset is associated with lower sample ductility. The correlation between crack onset in a sample and its mechanical properties as uncovered here is potentially useful in preparing crack-resistant coatings and diverse clay structures.</description>

      <title>Contextual Subspace Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo: Improved bias with reduced quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using trial wavefunctions prepared on quantum devices to reduce the bias of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) has established itself as a promising hybrid approach to the simulation of strongly correlated many body systems. Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing the trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated by classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection formalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the recently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation in QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method outperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy computations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the original number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Lower Temporal Limit of Laser-Produced Plasma Sources for Table-Top Soft X-ray NEXAFS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements for understanding dynamics in molecular and material systems has led to many advances in table-top sources for pulsed X-rays. We report on a table top laser-produced plasma (LPP) source that can perform soft X-ray (SXR), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) measurements using a laser source with 23 ps pulse duration. The spectrometer's key specifications, such as brilliance, resolution, and stability, are characterized against the more commonly used longer-pulse-duration LPP sources. The 23 ps laser produced approximately an order of magnitude weaker SXR flux than the 8 ns laser for a higher power density due to the smaller total energy absorbed by the plasma. The increased repetition rate and an implemented self-referencing scheme still allowed for high-resolution, synchrotron-like NEXAFS measurements of Si3N4 and TiO2 thin films with 2.5 minute acquisition times. It was observed that degradation of the gas jet nozzle led to long-term instability of the source, which can be remediated using alternative nozzle designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving higher temporal resolution in future time-resolved X-ray absorption measurements using table-top laser-produced plasma sources</description>
