      <title>Decoupling of carbonate-organic carbon isotope during the Carnian Pluvial Episode</title>

Abstract: The Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE) was a major global climate change event in the early Late Triassic that significantly affected marine ecosystems and carbon cycles. One of the most prominent features of the CPE is the coupled multiple negative carbonate-organic carbon isotope excursions. However, at Erguan and Xiashulao from eastern Tethys, a decoupling between carbonate-organic carbon isotope during CPE was observed. At the end of early Carnian (Julian), the carbonate carbon isotope showed a negative excursion of 2-3 per-mille, while the organic carbon isotope exhibited a positive excursion of about 3-4 per-mille. In addition, increased terrestrial inputs is indicated by the rising C/N (3 to 10) and decreasing Y/Ho (42 to 27) that coexist with this decoupling. The coupling of carbon isotope negative excursions is from the shallow shelves and the deep slopes, whereas the decoupling occurs from the deep shelf to the shallow slope. In the deep shelf to the shallow slope, sedimentary organic matter is mainly sourced from pelagic before the CPE as evidenced by low C/N (3) and high Y/Ho (36-42). During the CPE, the increased fresh water flux (Sr/Ba &lt;1) enhanced terrestrial input in organic matter, which may cause positive excursions in the carbon isotope record with elevated TOC content. As a result, the carbonate-organic carbon isotope decoupled. In contrast, organic matter in sediments from the shallow shelf and deep slope are mainly from terrestrial and pelagic sources, respectively. This study reveals the significant impact of terrestrial inputs on marine carbon cycling during the Carnian Pluvial Episode, highlighting the crucial role of climate events in modifying the carbon isotope record.</description>

      <title>LangYa: Revolutionizing Cross-Spatiotemporal Ocean Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean forecasting is crucial for both scientific research and societal benefits. Currently, the most accurate forecasting systems are global ocean forecasting systems (GOFSs), which represent the ocean state variables (OSVs) as discrete grids and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the transitions of oceanic state variables using numerical methods. However, GOFSs processes are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors. Recently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted forecasting speed and accuracy. Unfortunately, building a large AI ocean forecasting system that can be considered cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled forecasts remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce LangYa, a cross-spatiotemporal and air-sea coupled ocean forecasting system. Results demonstrate that the time embedding module in LangYa enables a single model to make forecasts with lead times ranging from 1 to 7 days. The air-sea coupled module effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention module improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training, and the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline forecasting. Compared to existing numerical and AI-based ocean forecasting systems, LangYa uses 27 years of global ocean data from the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation version 12 (GLORYS12) for training and achieves more reliable deterministic forecasting results for OSVs. LangYa forecasting system provides global ocean researchers with access to a powerful software tool for accurate ocean forecasting and opens a new paradigm for ocean science.</description>
