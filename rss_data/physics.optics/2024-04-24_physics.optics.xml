      <title>Plasmon-enhanced Brillouin Light Scattering spectroscopy for magnetic systems. I. Theoretical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is an effective method for detecting spin waves in magnetic thin films and nanostructures. While it provides extensive insight into the properties of spin waves, BLS spectroscopy is impeded in many practical cases by the limited range of detectable spin wave wavenumbers and its low sensitivity. Here, we present a generalized theoretical model describing plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy. Three types of plasmonic nanoparticles in the shape of an ellipsoid of rotation are considered: a single plasmon resonator, a sandwiched plasmonic structure in which two nanoparticles are separated by a dielectric spacer, and an ensemble of metallic nanoparticles on the surface of a magnetic film. The effective susceptibilities for the plasmonic systems at the surface of the magnetic film are calculated using the electrodynamic Green functions method, and the enhancement coefficient is defined. It is analytically shown that the ratio of the plasmon resonator height to its radius plays the key role in the development of plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy. The developed model serves as a basis for numerical engineering of the optimized plasmon nanoparticle morphology for BLS enhancement.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-enhanced Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) spectroscopy for magnetic systems. II. Numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for detecting spin waves in magnetic thin films and nanostructures. Despite comprehensive access to spin-wave properties, BLS spectroscopy suffers from the limited wavenumber of detectable spin waves and the typically relatively low sensitivity. In this work, we present the results of numerical simulations based on the recently developed analytical model describing plasmon-enhanced BLS. The effective susceptibility is defined for a single plasmonic nanoparticle in the shape of an ellipsoid of rotation, for the sandwiched plasmonic nanoparticles separated by a dielectric spacer, as well as for the array of plasmonic resonators on the surface of a magnetic film. It is shown that the eccentricity of the metal nanoparticles, which describes their shape, plays a key role in the enhancement of the BLS signal. The optimal conditions for BLS enhancement are numerically defined for gold and silver plasmon systems for photons of different energies. The presented results define the roadmap for the experimental realization of plasmon-enhanced BLS spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Rare-earth doped optical dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical forces applied to a rare-earth doped optical dimer made of identical Yb3+:YAG nanospheres placed in the plane electromagnetic field propagating in vacuum has been theoretically considered. The electromagnetic fields at wavelengths 968 nm and 1030 nm have been normally and axially directed to the dimer axis. Wavelengths 968 nm and 1030 nm are resonant with the electron transitions of the Yb3+ ions and can generate the Stokes and anti-Stokes cycles, respectively. It has been shown that the electromagnetic field propagating at wavelength 1030 nm not only can be used to control optical forces applied to the dimer, but can cause cooling of the dimer, which is desirable in a number of applications.</description>

      <title>X-ray Interferometry Using a Modulated Phase Grating: Theory and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray grating interferometry allows for the simultaneous acquisition of attenuation, differential-phase contrast, and dark-field images, resulting from X-ray attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering, respectively. The modulated phase grating (MPG) interferometer is a recently developed grating interferometry system capable of generating a directly resolvable interference pattern using a relatively large period grating envelope function that is sampled at a pitch that allows for X-ray spatial coherence using a microfocus X-ray source or by use of a source G0 grating that follows the Lau condition. We present the theory of the MPG interferometry system for a 2-dimensional staggered grating, derived using Fourier optics, and we compare the theoretical predictions with experiments we have performed with a microfocus X-ray system at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LSU. The theoretical and experimental fringe visibility is evaluated as a function of grating-to-detector distance. Quantitative experiments are performed with porous carbon and alumina samples, and qualitative analysis of attenuation and dark-field images of a dried anchovy are shown.</description>

      <title>Hybrid modes in multilayer/antenna architecture set sideband-selective molecular Raman scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of healthcare, label-free sensing is a vital component for various applications. Micro-photonic technology presents a promising avenue to pursue pivotal goals. With the use of this technology, healthcare professionals and researchers can harness the power of label-free sensing to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The integration of label-free sensing and micro-photonic technology can lead to revolutionary advancements in the healthcare industry. Here, a hybrid multilayer, whose surface is decorated with micrometric features has been investigated to evaluate the application in this direction. Following the characterization of the plasmonic resonance, and upon demonstrating the surface plasmon polariton (SPP)/antenna mode hybridiza-tion, the optomechanical behavior of the system has been investigated. The hybrid system has a higher sensi-tivity due to its high-quality factor Q when compared to standard systems. The shift of the frequency is studied for a red dye, at different excitation wavelengths as well as in an aqueous environment. To validate the increased sensitivity, I conducted an analysis using bovine serum albumin (BSA). This protein is water-soluble and has an infrared absorption band (amide I), and it is also active in the Raman region. Moreover, it can consistently bind to Ag features. Through an image-based analysis, the surface-enhanced Raman scattering pattern of the BSA was recorded. The proposed sensing method is innovative and opens new perspectives on sensitive methods for biomolecule detection. Simultaneously, it shows promising results to exploit the optical resonance shift as a basic sensing approach for probing molecular patterns.</description>

      <title>In-situ Doppler-free spectroscopy and laser frequency stabilization based on time-division multiplexing differential saturated absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel time-division multiplexing differential saturated absorption spectroscopy (TDMDSAS) approach, providing superior accuracy and stability in Doppler-free spectroscopy. By distinguishing probe and reference fields in the temporal domain, TDMDSAS efficiently suppresses Doppler broadening and common-mode optical noise. We utilized this technology to determine the absolute frequency of diverse neutral Yb isotopes across its $6s^2\ ^{1}S_0\to 6s6p ^{1}P_1$ transitions. Furthermore, the first-ever observation of in-situ Doppler-free Zeeman sub-level spectra was accomplished, enabling the determination of magnetic field gradients. We stabilized a UV diode laser at 399 nm using an error signal derived from the spectral first-derivative demodulated signal of $^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. This technique yielded a frequency stability of up to 15 kHz with a 40 s averaging time and a standard deviation of around 180 kHz over a half-hour period. Given its low cost, straightforward, and scalable nature, TDMDSAS holds excellent potential in metrology and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Canalization-based super-resolution imaging using a single van der Waals layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canalization is an optical phenomenon that enables unidirectional propagation of light in a natural way, i.e., without the need for predefined waveguiding designs. Predicted years ago, it was recently demonstrated using highly confined phonon polaritons (PhPs) in twisted layers of the van der Waals (vdW) crystal alpha-MoO3, offering unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, despite this finding, applications based on polariton canalization have remained elusive so far, which can be explained by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a novel canalization phenomenon, arising in a single vdW thin layer (alpha-MoO3) when it is interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity, that allows us to demonstrate a proof-of-concept application based on polariton canalization: super-resolution (up to ~{\lambda}0/220) nanoimaging. Importantly, we find that canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three distinct parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step towards multifaceted photonic applications, encompassing imaging, data transmission, and ultra-compact photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Coupled Mode Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optics and photonics, a small number of building blocks, like resonators, waveguides, arbitrary couplings, and parametric interactions, allow the design of a broad variety of devices and functionalities, distinguished by their scattering properties. These include transducers, amplifiers, and nonreciprocal devices, like isolators or circulators. Usually, the design of such a system is handcrafted by an experienced scientist in a time-consuming process where it remains uncertain whether the simplest possibility has indeed been found. In our work, we develop a discovery algorithm that automates this challenge. By optimizing the continuous and discrete system properties our automated search identifies the minimal resources required to realize the requested scattering behavior. In the spirit of artificial scientific discovery, it produces a complete list of interpretable solutions and leads to generalizable insights, as we illustrate in several examples. This now opens the door to rapid design in areas like photonic and microwave architectures or optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Stable vortex solitons sustained by a localized gain in the cubic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple dissipative system with purely cubic defocusing nonlinearity and nonuniform linear gain that can support stable local-ized dissipative vortex solitons with high topological charges without the utilization of competing nonlinearities and nonlinear gain or losses. Localization of such solitons is achieved due to an intriguing mechanism when defocusing nonlinearity stimulates energy flow from the ring-like region with linear gain to the periphery of the medium where energy is absorbed due to linear background losses. Vortex solitons bifurcate from linear gain-guided vortical modes with eigenvalues depending on topological charges that become purely real only at specific gain amplitudes. Increasing gain amplitude leads to transverse expansion of vortex solitons, but simultaneously it usually also leads to stability enhance-ment. Increasing background losses allows creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges that are usually prone to instabilities in conservative and dissipative systems. Propagation of the perturbed unstable vortex solitons in this system reveals unusual dynamical re-gimes, when instead of decay or breakup, the initial state transforms into stable vortex soliton with lower or sometimes even with higher topo-logical charge. Our results suggest an efficient mechanism for the formation of nonlinear excited vortex-carrying states with suppressed destructive azimuthal modulational instabilities in a simple setting relevant to a wide class of systems, including polaritonic systems, structured microcavities, and lasers.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Optical Imaging Limit through Atmospheric Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recording and identifying faint objects through atmospheric scattering media by an optical system are fundamentally interesting and technologically important. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive model that incorporates contributions from target characteristics, atmospheric effects, imaging system, digital processing, and visual perception to assess the ultimate perceptible limit of geometrical imaging, specifically the angular resolution at the boundary of visible distance. The model allows to reevaluate the effectiveness of conventional imaging recording, processing, and perception and to analyze the limiting factors that constrain image recognition capabilities in atmospheric media. The simulations were compared with the experimental results measured in a fog chamber and outdoor settings. The results reveal general good agreement between analysis and experimental, pointing out the way to harnessing the physical limit for optical imaging in scattering media. An immediate application of the study is the extension of the image range by an amount of 1.2 times with noise reduction via multi-frame averaging, hence greatly enhancing the capability of optical imaging in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved CARS by coherent image scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present super-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy by implementing phase-resolved image scanning microscopy (ISM), achieving up to two-fold resolution increase as compared with a conventional CARS microscope. Phase-sensitivity is required for the standard pixel-reassignment procedure since the scattered field is coherent, thus the point-spread function (PSF) is well-defined only for the field amplitude. We resolve the complex field by a simple add-on to the CARS setup enabling inline interferometry. Phase-sensitivity offers additional contrast which informs the spatial distribution of both resonant and nonresonant scatterers. As compared with alternative super-resolution schemes in coherent nonlinear microscopy, the proposed method is simple, requires only low-intensity excitation, and is compatible with any conventional forward-detected CARS imaging setup.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional gradient force optical trapping in dielectric nanocavities by inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical trapping enables precise control of individual particles of different sizes, such as atoms, molecules, or nanospheres. Optical tweezers provide free-space omnidirectional optical trapping of objects in laboratories around the world. As an alternative to standard macroscopic setups based on lenses, which are inherently bound by the diffraction limit, plasmonic and photonic nanostructures promise trapping by near-field optical effects on the extreme nanoscale. However, the practical design of lossless waveguide-coupled nanostructures capable of trapping deeply sub-wavelength particles in all spatial directions using the gradient force has until now proven insurmountable. In this work, we demonstrate an omnidirectional optical trap realized by inverse-designing fabrication-ready integrated dielectric nanocavities. The sub-wavelength optical trap is designed to rely solely on the gradient force and is thus particle-size agnostic. In particular, we show how a nanometer-sized trapped particle experiences a force strong enough to overcome room-temperature thermal fluctuations. Furthermore, through the robust inverse design framework, we tailor manufacturable devices operating at near-infrared and optical frequencies. Our results open a new regime of levitated optical trapping by achieving a deep trapping potential capable of trapping single sub-wavelength particles in all directions using optical gradient forces. We anticipate potentially groundbreaking applications of the optimized optical trapping system for biomolecular analysis in aqueous environments, levitated cavity-optomechanics, and cold atom physics, constituting an important step towards realizing integrated bio-nanophotonics and mesoscopic quantum mechanical experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of optical excitation using two interfering ultrashort optical pulses on ultrafast magnetization dynamics. Our investigation focuses on Pt/Co/Pt multilayers and TbCo alloy samples, employing a dual pump approach. We observe significant variations in the dynamics of magnetization suppression and subsequent recovery when triggered with two optical pulses of the same polarization-essentially meeting conditions for interference. Conversely, dynamics triggered with cross-polarized pump beams exhibit expected similarity to that triggered with a single pulse. Delving into the underlying physical processes contributing to laser-induced demagnetization and recovery dynamics, we find that our current understanding cannot elucidate the observed trends. Consequently, we propose that optical excitation with interfering light possesses not previously acknowledged capacity to induce long-lasting alterations in the dynamics of angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a new geometry for laser amplifiers based on bulk gain media. The overlapped seed and pump beams are repetitively refocused into the gain medium with a Herriott-type multipass cell. Similar to a waveguide, this configuration allows for a confined propagation inside the gain medium over much longer lengths than in ordinary single pass bulk amplifiers. Inside the gain medium, the foci appear at separate locations. A proof-of-principle demonstration with Ti:sapphire indicates that this could lead to higher amplification due to a distribution of the thermal load.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive and efficient 1550 nm photodetector for room temperature operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective quantum communication requires room temperature (RT) operating single photon sensor with high photo detection efficiency (PDE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photo detectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. Often the requirements for RT operation and for the high PDE are in conflict, resulting in a compromised solution. We have developed a device which employs a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by orders of magnitude and increase the PDE. The device is predicted to achieve RT operation with a PDE &gt;99%. Harnessing the high carrier mobility of 2D materials, the device has ~ps jitter time and can be integrated into a large 2D array camera.</description>

Existing adaptive optics systems typically rely on iterative search algorithm to correct for aberrations and improve images. This study demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks to characterise the optical aberration by directly predicting the Zernike coefficients from two to three phase-diverse optical images. We evaluated our network on 600,000 simulated Point Spread Function (PSF) datasets randomly generated within the range of -1 to 1 radians using the first 25 Zernike coefficients. The results show that using only three phase-diverse images captured above, below and at the focal plane with an amplitude of 1 achieves a low RMSE of 0.10 radians on the simulated PSF dataset. Furthermore, this approach directly predicts Zernike modes simulated extended 2D samples, while maintaining a comparable RMSE of 0.15 radians. We demonstrate that this approach is effective using only a single prediction step, or can be iterated a small number of times. This simple and straightforward technique provides rapid and accurate method for predicting the aberration correction using three or less phase-diverse images, paving the way for evaluation on real-world dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields. For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of photon traps within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The trapping mechanism is based on the fact that, for null background fields, the optical metric reduces to the Kerr-Schild form, which plays a prominent role in the context of black hole physics. We then construct explicit examples where photons are confined in a region of spacetime, such that a distant observer cannot interact with them. Finally, we argue that the trapping scheme is quite universal, being entirely compatible with causality, energy conditions, and hyperbolicity.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems have been used to reveal interesting fundamental physics and to improve information capacity and noise resilience in quantum information processing. However, it remains a significant challenge to realize universal two-photon quantum gates in high dimensions with high success probability. Here, by considering an ion-cavity QED system, we theoretically propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first high-dimensional, deterministic and universal two-photon quantum gate. By using an optical cavity embedded with a single trapped 40Ca+ ion, we achieve a high average fidelity larger than 98% for a quantum controlled phase-flip gate in four-dimensional space, spanned by photonic spin angular momenta and orbital angular momenta. Our proposed system can be an essential building block for high-dimensional quantum information processing, and also provides a platform for studying high-dimensional cavity QED.</description>

      <title>Pure skin effect obeying power partition in directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has received great attention recently. In particular, band structures in non-Hermitian systems can be engineered to exhibit various topological effects. Among them, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we investigate NHSE in systems featuring directed chains or directed graphs, where the arrows denote the directions of the non-reciprocal hopping between neighbouring nodes. We show that the systems exhibit pure skin modes with non-oscillatory wavefunctions, in contrast to previously studied NHSE. Interestingly, the sum of the decay constants along different directions for each skin mode obeys a power partition rule, i.e. their sum is a fixed value and the value of each constant only depends on the ratio between the non-reciprocal hopping parameters and is independent of detailed graph configurations. Such Pure Skin Effect (PSE) can be explained by using a generalized method for solving the Generalized Brillouin-zone with multiple bulk states.</description>

      <title>Shaping non-reciprocal caustic spin-wave beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Motion of 2D exciton in momentum space leads to pseudospin distribution narrowing on the Bloch Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motional narrowing implies narrowing induced by motion, for example, in nuclear resonance, the thermally induced random motion of the nuclei in an inhomogeneous environment leads to counter-intuitive narrowing of the resonance line. Similarly, the excitons in monolayer semiconductors experience magnetic inhomogeneity: the electron-hole spin-exchange interaction manifests as an in-plane pseudo-magnetic field with a periodically varying orientation inside the exciton band. The excitons undergo random momentum scattering and pseudospin precession repeatedly in this inhomogeneous magnetic environment - typically resulting in fast exciton depolarization. On the contrary, we show that such magnetic inhomogeneity averages out at high scattering rate due to motional narrowing. Physically, a faster exciton scattering leads to a narrower pseudospin distribution on the Bloch sphere, implying a nontrivial improvement in exciton polarization. The in-plane nature of the pseudo-magnetic field enforces a contrasting scattering dependence between the circularly and linearly polarized excitons - providing a spectroscopic way to gauge the sample quality.</description>

      <title>(Sub-)picosecond surface correlations of femtosecond laser excited Al-coated multilayers observed by grazing-incidence x-ray scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond high-intensity laser pulses at intensities surpassing $10^{14} \,\text{W}/\text{cm}^2$ can generate a diverse range of functional surface nanostructures. Achieving precise control over the production of these functional structures necessitates a thorough understanding of the surface morphology dynamics with nanometer-scale spatial resolution and picosecond-scale temporal resolution. In this study, we show that individual XFEL pulses can elucidate structural changes on surfaces induced by laser-generated plasmas, employing grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS). Using aluminum-coated multilayer samples we can differentiate between ultrafast surface morphology dynamics and subsequent subsurface density dynamics, achieving nanometer-depth sensitivity and subpicosecond temporal resolution. The observed subsurface density dynamics serve to validate advanced simulation models depicting matter under extreme conditions. Our findings promise to unveil novel avenues for laser material nanoprocessing and high-energy-density science.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. Without direct image reconstruction, it classifies an object in terms of the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the same behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical neuron (that is at least linear in the image resolution). We provide simulations and analytical comparisons with analogous neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale optical nonreciprocity with nonlinear metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14952v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical nonreciprocity is manifested as a difference in the transmission of light for the opposite directions of excitation. Nonreciprocal optics is traditionally realized with relatively bulky components such as optical isolators based on the Faraday rotation, hindering the miniaturization and integration of optical systems. Here we demonstrate free-space nonreciprocal transmission through a metasurface comprised of a two-dimensional array of nanoresonators made of silicon hybridized with vanadium dioxide (VO2). This effect arises from the magneto-electric coupling between Mie modes supported by the resonator. Nonreciprocal response of the nanoresonators occurs without the need for external bias; instead, reciprocity is broken by the incident light triggering the VO2 phase transition for only one direction of incidence. Nonreciprocal transmission is broadband covering over 100 nm in the telecommunication range in the vicinity of {\lambda}=1.5 um. Each nanoresonator unit cell occupies only about 0.1 {\lambda}^3 in volume, with the metasurface thickness measuring about half-a-micron. Our self-biased nanoresonators exhibit nonreciprocity down to very low levels of intensity on the order of 150 W/cm^2 or a uW per nanoresonator. We estimate picosecond-scale transmission fall times and sub-microsecond scale transmission rise. Our demonstration brings low-power, broadband and bias-free optical nonreciprocity to the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication has been at the forefront of modern research for decades, however it is severely hampered in underwater applications, where the properties of water absorb nearly all useful optical wavelengths and prevent them from propagating more than, in most cases, a few metres. This research reports on-demand quantum light sources, suitable for underwater optical communication. The single photon emitters, which can be engineered using an electron beam, are based on impurities in hexagonal boron nitride. They have a zero phonon line at ~ 436 nm, near the minimum value of water absorption and are shown to suffer negligible transmission and purity loss when travelling through water channels. These emitters are also shown to possess exceptional underwater transmission properties compared to emitters at other optical wavelengths and are utilised in a proof of principle underwater communication link with rates of several kbits/s.</description>

Abstract: Confining light illumination in the three dimensions of space is a challenge for various applications. Among these, optogenetic methods developed for live experiments in cell biology would benefit from such a localized illumination as it would improve the spatial resolution of diffusive photosensitive proteins leading to spatially constrained biological responses in specific subcellular organelles. Here, we describe a method to create and move a focused evanescent spot across the field of view of a high numerical aperture microscope objective, using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). We show that, after correcting the optical aberrations, light is confined within a spot of sub-micron lateral size and $\sim$100~nm axial depth, resulting in a volume of illumination drastically smaller than the one generated by a standard propagative focus. This evanescent focus is sufficient to induce a more intense and localized recruitment compared to a propagative focus on the optogenetic system CRY2-CIBN, improving the resolution of its pattern of activation.</description>

Abstract: The Wigner distribution function and the its spatial-angular moments (intensity-moments) are known as efficient instruments for characterization of complex quasimonochromatic light beams and their transformations. In this paper, the generalization of the WF-based approach to spatio-temporal (ST) light fields (wave packets, short pulses) is considered. It is shown that the ST intensity moments are related with the important characteristics of the wave-packet structure, especially, with the transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) being a specific feature of the ST optical vortices (STOV). The ST moments' transformations in a paraxial optical system obey simple and unified rules involving the ray-transfer ABCD-matrix of the system. On this base, and with simple examples of the OAM-carrying optical pulses, the schemes and mechanisms of the STOV generation and transformation are presented. Examples of non-vortex ST wave packets with the transverse OAM, their possible realizations are discussed as well as the relations between the OAM and the visible pulse rotations. The regular and unified formalism, developed in this paper, can be generalized and applied to more complex situations where the ST field propagates through inhomogeneous and random (scattering) media.</description>

      <title>Photomolecular Effect: Visible Light Absorption at Water-Vapor Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaporation of water is ubiquitous in nature and industrial technologies. The known mechanism for evaporation is "thermal evaporation" which highlights the energy input for evaporation is via heat. Due to the weak absorption of water to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water is usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes via additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we report here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the water-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we call photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the water-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular evaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the polarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase further support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths of visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer of fog easily, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous. The photomolecular effect will have significant implications for the earth's water cycle, global warming, plant transpiration, as well as different technologies involving the evaporation of liquids from drying to power generation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polariton is important in precisely controlling photons at the nanoscale. It was common practice to calculate the dielectric function of the phonon polariton system with the Drude-Lorenz model. We considered the impact of LO-TO splitting while applying the Drude-Lorenz model. Then the dielectric functions become wave vector direction dependent besides electric polarization direction dependent. Our results show that considering LO-TO splitting can more accurately predict dielectric functions. Additionally, we discovered that, besides hexagonal BN, hexagonal AlN exhibits a wide hyperbolic frequency band range, while the other four materials display it scarcely. Furthermore, we found that the phonon frequency, lifetime, and the difference of infrared active transverse optical phonon frequencies with different wave vector directions are critical factors in determining the width of the hyperbolic frequency band range. We also found some dumbbell-shaped and butterfly-shaped isofrequency curves in h-AlN, h-GaP, and especially h-GaN. Our study provides a fresh perspective on understanding the dielectric properties of these materials and lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration and development of new hyperbolic phonon polariton materials.</description>

Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous action of a single photon at two remote places</title>

Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>
