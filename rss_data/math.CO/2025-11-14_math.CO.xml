      <title>Region level via centralization for hyperplane arrangements and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Faces of a Hyperplane Arrangement Enumerated by Ideal Dimension, with Applications to Plane, Plaids, and Shi," Zaslavsky showed how to compute the number $r_\ell(\mathcal{A})$ of regions of a real hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ with a given level, refining his well known enumeration of regions and relatively bounded regions. We restate this theorem in terms of a construction called the centralization of $\mathcal{A}$, give a bijective proof, and then apply it in two ways to answer questions concerning the concept of level. Firstly, a consequence of this enumeration is that $r_\ell(\mathcal{A})$ depends only on the intersection poset $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{A})$, such that both $r_\ell$ and centralization can be defined in the more general setting of geometric semilattices. In this context we derive a very general expression for the characteristic polynomial of a geometric semilattice with several interesting corollaries. Secondly, recent investigations into the phenomenon of level have made little use of Zaslavsky's level-counting theorem, but it can be applied to obtain or generalize many of their results. In particular we show how exponential generating function identities (arXiv:2410.10198, arXiv:2411.02971) and an expression giving the characteristic polynomial in terms of $r_\ell$ (arXiv:2411.03756) can be derived for deformations of the braid arrangement.</description>

      <title>Minimal crossing diagrams of spatial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that all $1$-vertex spatial graphs with adequate diagrams have minimal crossing number, and that spatial graph diagrams obtained by replacing vertices and edges of a planar embedded graph by minimal crossing link or spatial graph diagrams have minimal crossing number. Finally, we give an example in answer to a question of Adams et al. about minimal crossing diagrams of rigid vertex graphs.</description>

      <title>Theory and algorithms for clusters of cycles in graphs for material networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of complex networks, particularly material networks such as the carbon skeleton of hydrocarbons generated in hydrocarbon pyrolysis in carbon-rich systems, is essential for effectively describing, modeling, and predicting their features. An important and the most challenging part of this analysis is the extraction and effective description of cycles, when many of them coalesce into complex clusters. A deterministic minimum cycle basis (MCB) is generally non-unique and biased to the vertex enumeration. The union of all MCBs, called the set of relevant cycles, is unique, but may grow exponentially with the graph size. To resolve these issues, we propose a method to sample an MCB uniformly at random. The output MCB is statistically well-defined, and its size is proportional to the number of edges. We review and advance the theory of graph cycles from previous works of Vismara, Gleiss et al., and Kolodzik et al. In particular, we utilize the polyhedron-interchangeability (pi) and short loop-interchangeability (sli) classes to partition the relevant cycles. We introduce a postprocessing step forcing pairwise intersections of relevant cycles to consist of a single path. This permits the definition of a dual graph whose nodes are cycles and edges connect pairs of intersecting cycles. The pi classes identify building blocks for crystalline structures. The sli classes group together sets of large redundant cycles. We present the application to an amorphous hydrocarbon network, where we (i) theorize how the number of relevant cycles may explode with system size and (ii) observe small polyhedral structures related to diamond.</description>

      <title>Computing parametric weighted Ehrhart polynomials of smooth polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that when integral polytopes are deformed while keeping the same facet normal vectors, the coefficients of weighted Ehrhart and $h^*$-polynomials are piecewise polynomial functions in the ``right hand sides'' of the linear inequalities defining the polytopes. We give an algorithm and an implementation in SageMath for computing these polynomials for smooth polytopes, such as type $A$ alcoved polytopes, using a weighted Euler-Maclaurin type formula by Khovanski\v{i} and Pukhlikov. We discuss some natural questions concerning signs of the coefficients of the weighted $h^*$-polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Integral Analogue of Grunert's Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a closed symbolic expansion for the operator \(x\mathrm{I}\), where \(\mathrm{I}f(x) = \int_0^x f(t)\,dt\), analogous to the Grunert formula for the Euler operator \(xD\). Specifically, we prove that \[ (x\mathrm{I})^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k\, a(n-1,k)\, x^{\,n-k} \mathrm{I}^{\,n+k}, \] where \(a(n,k)\) are the Bessel numbers (OEIS \seqnum{A001498}). This expansion provides a unified symbolic framework for computing iterated integrals and yields new identities involving classical functions and integer sequences.</description>

      <title>Odd-Cycle-Packing-treewidth: On the Maximum Independent Set problem in odd-minor-free graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the tree-decomposition-based graph parameter Odd-Cycle-Packing-treewidth (OCP-tw) as a width parameter that asks to decompose a given graph into pieces of bounded odd cycle packing number. The parameter OCP-tw is monotone under the odd-minor-relation and we provide an analogue to the celebrated Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for OCP-tw. That is, we identify two infinite families of grid-like graphs whose presence as odd-minors implies large OCP-tw and prove that their absence implies bounded OCP-tw. This structural result is constructive and implies a 2^(poly(k))poly(n)-time parameterized poly(k)-approximation algorithm for OCP-tw.
  Moreover, we show that the (weighted) Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded OCP-tw. Finally, we lift the concept of OCP-tw to a parameter for matrices of integer programs. To this end, we show that our strategy can be applied to efficiently solve integer programs whose matrices can be "tree-decomposed" into totally delta-modular matrices with at most two non-zero entries per row.</description>

      <title>The maximum diameter of 2-dimensional simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a problem of Santos about the largest possible diameter of a $d$-dimensional (abstract) simplicial complex on $n$ vertices. For dimension 2, we determine the exact value of the maximum for every $n$ using an explicit construction. We also come across a tantalizing open problem about the packing of squares of Hamilton cycles in the complete graph and obtain an infinite sequence of tight explicit constructions.</description>

      <title>Diameters of commuting graphs of partial transformation semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a finite set. We determine the diameter of the commuting graph of the partial transformation semigroup $\mathcal{P}(X)$ on $X$ and show that it coincides with the diameter of the commuting graph of the transformation semigroup $\mathcal{T}(X)$ on $X$, which was previously determined by Ara\'ujo, Kinyon and Konieczny. This proves the existence of a semigroup $S$ and of a proper subsemigroups $T$ of $S$ such that the diameters of the commuting graphs of $S$ and $T$ are equal.</description>

      <title>Forbidden multipliers in abelian difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make the observation that certain group automorphisms that fix a large subgroup of an abelian group cannot be multipliers in any non-trivial abelian difference sets, with the single exception of an involution that can be a multiplier in Hadamard difference sets, provided that the difference set contains a sub-difference set of the same type. We use this observation together with a multiplier theorem to rule out the existence of difference sets, and derive bounds for the numerical multiplier group of a difference set.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial degree version of a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tucker's lemma with a combinatorial proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial analogues of classical Borsuk-Ulam type theorems (e.g., Tucker's lemma, $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tucker's lemma etc.) have numerous important applications in combinatorics. In this paper, we formulate a combinatorial degree version of a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tucker's lemma. Our proof is purely combinatorial in the sense that it does not involve homology, cohomology or any notions from continuous topology. As the main technical tool to prove the aforementioned degree theorem, we prove a Hopf trace type formula, which is also purely combinatorial and involves no homology. This combinatorial Hopf trace formula is of independent interest.</description>

  elements which is pseudomodular and whose dual is non-algebraic. It

      <title>Odd-Ramsey numbers of Hamilton cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The odd-Ramsey number $r_{{\text odd}}(n,H)$ of a graph $H$, as introduced by Alon in his work on graph-codes, is the minimum number of colours needed to edge-colour $K_n$ so that every copy of $H$ intersects some colour class in an odd number of edges. In this paper, we determine the odd-Ramsey number of Hamilton cycles up to a small multiplicative factor, proving that $r_{{\text odd}}(n,C_n) = \Theta(\sqrt{n})$. Our upper bound follows from an explicit finite-field construction, while the matching lower bound uses a combinatorial framework based on parity switches. We also initiate the study of odd-Ramsey numbers of Hamilton cycles in Dirac graphs, demonstrating that a small increase in the minimum degree beyond $n/2$ forces nontrivial odd-Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Outline Rectangles, Allocations, and Latin Young Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Young diagram is \emph{Latin} if there is an assignment of integers to its cells so that each row $i$ of length $l_i$ is populated by the numbers $1,\ldots,l_i$, and the numbers in each column are distinct. A Young diagram is called \emph{wide} if any subdiagram, formed by a subset of its rows, dominates its conjugate. Chow et al. [Advances in Applied Mathematics, 31, 2003] conjectured that any wide Young diagram is Latin. We introduce a notion of an \emph{allocation} which can be thought of as a coarse attempt at finding a Latin filling for a Young diagram. Using a theorem of Hilton, we prove that a Young diagram has an allocation if and only if it is Latin. This enables us to prove Chow et al.'s conjecture for Young diagrams with three distinct row lengths.</description>

      <title>Two new results on maximal left-compressed intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two new results on the theory of maximal left-compressed intersecting families (MLCIFs). First, we answer a question raised by Barber by showing that the number of $k$-uniform MLCIFs on a ground set of size $n$ grows as a doubly-exponential function of $k$, which we identify up to a log factor in the exponent. Among these MLCIFs we identify $k$ specific MLCIFs -- which we call the canonical MLCIFs -- as being in a meaningful way the most important MLCIFs. Specifically, our second main result shows that the canonical MLCIFs are precisely those which can have maximum weight among all $k$-uniform MLCIFs under a non-trivial increasing weight function, and moreover that each canonical MLCIF is the unique $k$-uniform MLCIF of maximum weight for some increasing weight function. This gives an interesting generalisation of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem to a notion of size which places greater significance on some elements of the ground set than others.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for union-closed family size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a union-closed family of sets with universe $\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A = [n] = \{1,\cdots,n\}$ and length $\ell$. We prove that $|\mathcal{A}| \leq \sum_{i=0}^{\ell} \binom{n}{i}$, with equality if and only if $\mathcal{A} = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\ell}\binom{[n]}{n-i}$. Additionally, by showing that $|\mathcal{A}| \leq \frac{\ell^p-1}{\ell-1}+2^n(1-2^{-\ell})^p$ for any nonnegative integer $p$, we establish for all integers $1 \leq k \leq n$ that $\sum_{i=0}^k \binom{n}{i} \leq \frac{k^{\hat{p}}-1}{k-1}+2^n(1-2^{-k})^{\hat{p}}$, where $\hat{p}=\lfloor (n-k)/\log_2(\frac{k}{1-2^{-k}})\rfloor + 1$.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Almost Optimal Solver for the Joint Routing-Assignment Problem via Partial JRA and Large-{\alpha} Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Joint Routing-Assignment (JRA) optimization problem simultaneously determines the assignment of items to placeholders and a Hamiltonian cycle that visits each node pair exactly once, with the objective of minimizing total travel cost. Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-{\alpha} constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the unit object in localized quantum unipotent category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the quiver Hecke algebra $R$, let $R\hbox{-gmod}$ be the category of finite-dimensional graded $R$-modules, and let $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ be the localization of $R\hbox{-gmod}$. Kashiwara and the second author showed the set of equivalence classes of simple objects up to grading shifts $\mathrm{Irr}(\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]})$ in $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ has a crystal structure, and $\mathrm{Irr}(\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]})$ is isomorphic to the so-called cellular crystal $\mathbb B_{\mathbf i}$. This isomorphism induces a function $\varepsilon_i^*$ on $\mathbb B_{\mathbf i}$. We give an explicit formula of $\varepsilon_i^*$, and using this formula, we give a characterization of the unit object of $\widetilde{R\hbox{-gmod}[w]}$ for the case of classical finite types.</description>

      <title>Witness Set in Monotone Polygons: Exact and Approximate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a simple polygon $\mathscr{P}$, two points $x$ and $y$ within $\mathscr{P}$ are {\em visible} to each other if the line segment between $x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathscr{P}$. The {\em visibility region} of a point $x$ includes all points in $\mathscr{P}$ that are visible from $x$. A point set $Q$ within a polygon $\mathscr{P}$ is said to be a \emph{witness set} for $\mathscr{P}$ if each point in $\mathscr{P}$ is visible from at most one point from $Q$. The problem of finding the largest size witness set in a given polygon was introduced by Amit et al. [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. 2010]. Recently, Daescu et al. [Comput. Geom. 2019] gave a linear-time algorithm for this problem on monotone mountains. In this study, we contribute to this field by obtaining the largest witness set within both continuous and discrete models.
  In the {\sc Witness Set (WS)} problem, the input is a polygon $\mathscr{P}$, and the goal is to find a maximum-sized witness set in $\mathscr{P}$. In the {\sc Discrete Witness Set (DisWS)} problem, one is given a finite set of points $S$ alongside $\mathscr{P}$, and the task is to find a witness set $Q \subseteq S$ that maximizes $|Q|$. We investigate {\sc DisWS} in simple polygons, but consider {\sc WS} specifically for monotone polygons. Our main contribution is as follows: (1) a polynomial time algorithm for {\sc DisWS} for general polygons and (2) the discretization of the {\sc WS} problem for monotone polygons. Specifically, given a monotone polygon with $r$ reflex vertices, and a positive integer $k$ we generate a point set $Q$ with size $r^{O(k)} \cdot n$ such that $Q$ contains an witness set of size $k$ (if exists). This leads to an exact algorithm for {\sc WS} problem in monotone polygons running in time $r^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$. We also provide a PTAS for this with running time $r^{O(1/\epsilon)} n^2$.</description>

      <title>Testing H-freeness on sparse graphs, the case of bounded expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In property testing, a tester makes queries to (an oracle for) a graph and, on a graph having or being far from having a property P, it decides with high probability whether the graph satisfies P or not. Often, testers are restricted to a constant number of queries. While the graph properties for which there exists such a tester are somewhat well characterized in the dense graph model, it is not the case for sparse graphs. In this area, Czumaj and Sohler (FOCS'19) proved that H-freeness (i.e. the property of excluding the graph H as a subgraph) can be tested with constant queries on planar graphs as well as on graph classes excluding a minor.
  Using results from the sparsity toolkit, we propose a simpler alternative to the proof of Czumaj and Sohler, for a statement generalized to the broader notion of bounded expansion. That is, we prove that for any class C with bounded expansion and any graph H, testing H-freeness can be done with constant query complexity on any graph G in C, where the constant depends on H and C, but is independent of G.
  While classes excluding a minor are prime examples of classes with bounded expansion, so are, for example, cubic graphs, graph classes with bounded maximum degree, graphs of bounded book thickness, or random graphs of bounded average degree.</description>

      <title>Observable sets for free Schr\"odinger equation on combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study observability for the free Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t u = i\Delta u$ on combinatorial graphs $G=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$. A subset $E\subset\mathcal{V}$ is observable at time $T&gt;0$ if there exists $C(T,E)&gt;0$ such that for all $u_0\in l^2(\mathcal{V})$, $$ \|u_0\|_{l^2(\mathcal{V})}^2 \le C(T,E)\int_0^T \|e^{it\Delta}u_0\|_{l^2(E)}^2\,dt. $$
  On the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ we obtain a sharp threshold for thick sets: if $E\subset\mathbb{Z}$ is $\gamma$-thick with $\gamma\geq1/2$, then $E$ is observable at some time; conversely, for every $\gamma&lt;1/2$ there exists a $\gamma$-thick set that is not observable at any time. This critical threshold marks the exact point where the discrete lattice departs from the real line: on the lattice it must be attained, whereas on $\R$ any $\gamma$-thick set with $\gamma&gt;0$ already suffices.
  On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ we show that complements of finite sets are observable at any time $T&gt;0$. This is a similar result to Euclidean space $\R^d$: any set that contains the exterior of a finite ball is observable at any time, in analogy with the free Schr\"odinger flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  For finite graphs we give an equivalent characterization of observability in terms of the zero sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions. As an application, we construct unobservable sets of large density on discrete tori, in contrast with the continuous torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, where every nonempty open set is observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general ideal of this paper is to answer the following question: given a numerical property of commuting graphs, a class of semigroups $\mathcal{C}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, is it possible to find a semigroup in $\mathcal{C}$ such that the chosen property is equal to $n$? We study this question for the classes of Clifford semigroups, inverse semigroups and completely regular semigroups. Moreover, the properties of commuting graphs we consider are the girth, clique number, chromatic number and knit degree.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for generalised Bernoulli-Laplace urn models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-colour multi-urn generalisation of the Bernoulli-Laplace urn model, consisting of $d$ urns, $m$ colours, and $dmn$ balls, with $dn$ balls of each colour and $mn$ balls in each urn. At each step, one ball is drawn uniformly at random from each urn, and the chosen balls are redistributed among the urns based on a permutation drawn from a distribution $\mu$ on the symmetric group $S_d$. We study the mixing time of this Markov chain for fixed $m$, $d$, and $\mu$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that there is cutoff whenever the chain on $[d]$ corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, and that the same holds for a labeled version of the model. As an application, we also obtain partial results on cutoff for a card shuffling version of the model in which the cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.</description>

Abstract: We give a new proof that the empirical measures of the roots of Eulerian polynomials converge to a certain log-Cauchy distribution. To do so, we show that each moment of the roots of a related family of polynomials not only converge, but in fact become ultimately constant. These asymptotic moments are expressed in terms of Cauchy numbers of the second kind.</description>

Abstract: The induced Ramsey number $R_{\mathrm{ind}}(H; r)$ of a graph $H$ is the minimum number $N$ such that there exists a graph with $N$ vertices for which all $r$-colourings of its edges contain a monochromatic induced copy of $H$. Our main result is the existence of a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that, for every graph $H$ on $k$ vertices, these numbers satisfy \begin{equation*}
  R_{\mathrm{ind}}(H; r) \le r^{C r k}. \end{equation*} When $r = 2$, this resolves a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s from 1975. For $r &gt; 2$, it answers a question of Conlon, Fox and Sudakov in a strong form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric representation of hypergraphs by representing hyperedges as simplices. Building on this framework, we employ homotopy groups to analyze the topological structure of hypergraphs embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Under the assumptions of the triangulation and that all $i$-th homotopy groups are trivial for $i \leq d-2$, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a $d$-uniform hypergraph to be embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be regarded as a kind of high-dimensional extension of Wagner's Theorem for planar graphs. Specifically, we establish that a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph embeds into $\mathbb{R}^d$ if and only if it contains neither $K_{d+3}^d$ nor $K_{3,d+1}^d$ as a minor. Here, a triangulated $d$-uniform topological hypergraph constitutes a geometrized form of a $d$-uniform hypergraph, while $K_{d+3}^d$ and $K_{3,d+1}^d$ are the high-dimensional generalizations of the complete graph $K_5$ and the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study Fair and Tolerant colorings (FAT colorings), where each vertex tolerates a given fraction of same-colored neighbors while fairness is preserved across the other coloring classes. Moreover, we define the FAT chromatic number $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}(G)$ as the largest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a FAT $k$-coloring. We establish general bounds on $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}$, relate it to structural and spectral properties of graphs, and characterize it completely for several families of graphs. We conclude with a list of open questions that suggest future directions.</description>

Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles. What is the maximal number of sides it can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that it starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 44, 55, 67, 79, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The proof of the latter is combinatoric and is valid for segments of pseudolines instead of lines, too. It is still unknown whether such optimal combinatoric configuration is stretchable for larger n.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1401.8052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class of generating functions for completely monotone sequences (moments of finite positive measures on $[0,1]$) has an elegant characterization as the class of Pick functions analytic and positive on $(-\infty,1)$. We establish this and another such characterization and develop a variety of consequences. In particular, we characterize generating functions for moments of convex and concave probability distribution functions on $[0,1]$. Also we provide a simple analytic proof that for any real $p$ and $r$ with $p&gt;0$, the Fuss-Catalan or Raney numbers $\frac{r}{pn+r}\binom{pn+r}{n}$, $n=0,1,\ldots$ are the moments of a probability distribution on some interval $[0,\tau]$ {if and only if} $p\ge1$ and $p\ge r\ge 0$. The same statement holds for the binomial coefficients $\binom{pn+r-1}n$, $n=0,1,\ldots$. A corrigendum (Trans. Amer. Math.Soc., to appear) has been included as an appendix, correcting gaps in the proof of Lemma 3.</description>

Abstract: We construct a pair of non-isomorphic, bipartite graphs which are not distinguished by counting the number of homomorphisms to any tree. This answers a question motivated by Atserias et al. (LICS 2021). In order to establish the construction, we analyse the equivalence relations induced by counting homomorphisms to trees of diameter two and three and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for two graphs to be equivalent. We show that three is the optimal diameter for our construction.</description>

      <title>A new approach to bipartite stable matching optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a common generalization of previously solved optimization problems concerning bipartite stable matchings, we describe a strongly polynomial network flow based algorithm for computing $\ell$ disjoint stable matchings with minimum total cost. The major observation behind the approach is that stable matchings, as edge sets, can be represented as certain cuts of an associated directed graph. This allows us to use results on disjoint cuts directly to answer questions about disjoint stable matchings. We also provide a construction that represents stable matchings as maximum-size antichains in a partially ordered set (poset), which enables us to apply the theorems of Dilworth, Mirsky, Greene and Kleitman directly to stable matchings. Another consequence of these approaches is a min-max formula for the minimum number of stable matchings covering all stable edges.</description>

      <title>Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</description>

      <title>Weingarten calculus with virtual isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the Weingarten calculus employing the notion of virtual isometries. Traditionally, Weingarten calculus provides explicit formulas for integrating polynomial functions over compact matrix groups with respect to the Haar measure, yet faces limitations when evaluating high-degree integrals due to the non-invertibility of the associated matrices. We revisit these classical computations from a new perspective: by constructing Haar-distributed matrices via sequences of complex reflections, we derive new recursive structures for the Weingarten functions across different dimensions. This framework leads to two main results: (1) an explicit Weingarten calculus for complex reflections, yielding systematic moment computations for associated rank-one matrices, and (2) a novel convolution formula that connects Weingarten functions in dimension $n$ to those in dimension $n-1$ through the introduction of ascension functions in the symmetric group algebra. Our approach not only provides a unified treatment for unitary groups, but also sheds light on the algebraic and probabilistic aspects of high-degree integral computations. Several examples and applications are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalizing matrix representations to fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic tree shapes capture fundamental signatures of evolution. We consider ``ranked'' tree shapes, which are equipped with a total order on the internal nodes compatible with the tree graph. Recent work has established an elegant bijection of ranked tree shapes and a class of integer matrices, called \textbf{F}-matrices, defined by simple inequalities. This formulation is for isochronous ranked tree shapes, where all leaves share the same sampling time, such as in the study of ancient human demography from present-day individuals. Another important style of phylogenetics concerns trees where the ``timing'' of events is by branch length rather than calendar time. This style of tree, called a rooted phylogram, is output by popular maximum-likelihood methods. These trees are broadly relevant, such as to study the affinity maturation of B cells in the immune system. Discretizing time in a rooted phylogram gives a fully heterochronous ranked tree shape, where leaves are part of the total order. Here we extend the \textbf{F}-matrix framework to such fully heterochronous ranked tree shapes. We establish an explicit bijection between a class of \textbf{F}-matrices and the space of such tree shapes. The matrix representation has the key feature that values at any entry are highly constrained via four previous entries, enabling straightforward enumeration of all valid tree shapes. We also use this framework to develop probabilistic models on ranked tree shapes. Our work extends understanding of combinatorial objects that have a rich history in the literature.</description>
