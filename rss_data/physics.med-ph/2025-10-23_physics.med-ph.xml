      <title>AI in Proton Therapy Treatment Planning: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Proton therapy provides superior dose conformity compared to photon therapy, but its treatment planning is challenged by sensitivity to anatomical changes, setup/range uncertainties, and computational complexity. This review evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving proton therapy treatment planning. Materials and methods: Recent studies on AI applications in image reconstruction, image registration, dose calculation, plan optimization, and quality assessment were reviewed and summarized by application domain and validation strategy. Results: AI has shown promise in automating contouring, enhancing imaging for dose calculation, predicting dose distributions, and accelerating robust optimization. These methods reduce manual workload, improve efficiency, and support more personalized planning and adaptive planning. Limitations include data scarcity, model generalizability, and clinical integration. Conclusion: AI is emerging as a key enabler of efficient, consistent, and patient-specific proton therapy treatment planning. Addressing challenges in validation and implementation will be essential for its translation into routine clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Real-time, inline quantitative MRI enabled by scanner-integrated machine learning: a proof of principle with NODDI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: The clinical feasibility and translation of many advanced quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques are inhibited by their restriction to 'research mode', due to resource-intensive, offline parameter estimation. This work aimed to achieve 'clinical mode' qMRI, by real-time, inline parameter estimation with a trained neural network (NN) fully integrated into a vendor's image reconstruction environment, therefore facilitating and encouraging clinical adoption of advanced qMRI techniques. Methods: The Siemens Image Calculation Environment (ICE) pipeline was customised to deploy trained NNs for advanced diffusion MRI parameter estimation with Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) Runtime. Two fully-connected NNs were trained offline with data synthesised with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model, using either conventionally estimated (NNMLE) or ground truth (NNGT) parameters as training labels. The strategy was demonstrated online with an in vivo acquisition and evaluated offline with synthetic test data. Results: NNs were successfully integrated and deployed natively in ICE, performing inline, whole-brain, in vivo NODDI parameter estimation in &lt;10 seconds. DICOM parametric maps were exported from the scanner for further analysis, generally finding that NNMLE estimates were more consistent than NNGT with conventional estimates. Offline evaluation confirms that NNMLE has comparable accuracy (or bias) and precision (or robustness to noise), whereas NNGT exhibits compromised accuracy at the benefit of higher precision. Conclusion: Real-time, inline parameter estimation with the proposed generalisable framework resolves a key practical barrier to clinical uptake of advanced qMRI methods and enables their efficient integration into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of literature T1 mapping methods to the underlying magnetization transfer parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters.
  Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\partial T_1^\text{observed} / \partial p_i^\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences.
  Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\text{s}$, $T_1^\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods.
  Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive modelling improves Fat DESPOT multiparametric relaxation mapping in fat-water mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To improve on the original form of Fat DESPOT, a multiparametric mapping technique that returns the fat- and water-specific estimates of $R_1$ ($R_{1f}$, $R_{1w}$), $R_2^*$ , and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) by upgrading the fat-water separation method used for selection of initial parameter guesses, and by introducing explicit model sensitivity to the phase of the water and fat signals. Methods: We compared the 3-point Dixon and Graph Cut (GC) approaches to initial guesses for Fat DESPOT in phantom experiments at 3 T in a variable fat fraction gel phantom. Also in phantom, we then compared the original Fat DESPOT approach to a magnitude approach modelling the phases of fat and water separately (Fat DESPOT$_{m\phi}$), and an approach that models the complex data (Fat DESPOT$_c$). The best-performing approach was then used in the lower leg of a healthy human participant. Results: In phantoms, Fat DESPOT using the 3-point Dixon and GC performed similarly in parametric estimates and precision, though the Dixon approach deviated from the overall trend in the 50% nominal fat fraction ROI. Furthermore, Fat DESPOT$_c$ showed the best agreement with reference PDFF (average error 1.5 +/- 1.2%) and the lowest combined standard deviation across ROIs, for PDFF, $R_{1f}$, and $R_{1w}$ ({\sigma} = 0.13%, 0.19 s$^{-1}$, 0.0082 s$^{-1}$). Conclusion: With a higher precision of $R_{1f}$ and $R_{1w}$ , accuracy of PDFF, and more echo time versatility than other compared approaches, this work demonstrates the advantages of the GC approach for initial guesses paired with complex fitting for Fat DESPOT multiparametric imaging.</description>
