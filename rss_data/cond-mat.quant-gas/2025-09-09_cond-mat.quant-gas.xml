      <title>Measuring the Chern-Simons invariant in quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons (CS) invariant is a fundamental topological invariant describing the topological invariance of 3D space based on the Chern-Simons field theory. To date, direct measurement of the CS invariant in a physical system remains elusive. %to be elusive. Here, the CS invariant is experimentally measured by quenching a 2D optical Raman lattice with 1/2 spin in ultracold atoms. With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near $\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also observe transitions among these values, which indicates the change of the topology of the quantum state in (2+1)D quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of the influence of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations using a cloud-accessible experiment platform of Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based experiments in this field.</description>

      <title>The vortex comb: eliminating vortices from Bose-Einstein condensates using optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce and explore a technique for the efficient removal of vortices from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, through the application and subsequent removal of a one-dimensional optical lattice. We showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow, optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of condensates.</description>

      <title>Strongly tilted field induced fractional quantized-drift in non-interacting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantized response appears to be a distinctive characteristic in interacting topological systems. Here, we discover a novel phenomenon of tilt-induced fractional quantize drift in non-interacting system constructed by a time-modulated superlattice subjected to a external time-independent gradient potential. Depending on the tilt strength, Rabi oscillations between adjacent lowest enegy bands caused by Landau-Zener tunneling, can induce that the one-cycle-averaged drift displacement is fraction, which is relate to the ratio of the sum of Chern numbers of multiple bands to the number of energy bands involved in Landau Zener tunneling. As representative examples, we construct fractional (1/3, 1/2) quantize drift only via adjusting period of lattice. The numerical simulations allow us to consider a realistic setup amenable of an experimental realization. Our findings will expand the research implications of both fractional quantize response and topological materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect in a four-site Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Anomalous Three-Body Loss in a Population Imbalanced Three-Component Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this perspective review, we present a concise yet multifaceted overview of the pivotal role played by the the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio across various physical contexts. After summarizing some of the main aspects of the bound obtained by Kovtun, Son and Starinets, we examine potential sources of its violation, exploring the insights these may offer and their connections to fundamental causality conditions. We also review a range of experimental tests conducted in diverse, yet complementary, physical systems, discussing the prospects opened by upcoming measurements.</description>

      <title>Collective dissipation engineering of interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Enhanced Localization in a Disorder-Free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.</description>

      <title>Towards effective models for low-dimensional cuprates: From ground state Hamiltonian reconstruction to spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point with emergent spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Universal Efimov spectra and fermionic doublets in highly mass-imbalanced cold-atom mixtures with van der Waals and dipole interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced three-body systems composed of two identical heavy atoms and one light atom, focusing on the Er-Er-Li and Dy-Dy-Li cold-atom mixtures with strong dipole-dipole interactions between the heavy atoms. By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>
