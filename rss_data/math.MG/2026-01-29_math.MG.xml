      <title>On The Fourier Mean Bodies of a Convex Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1998, R. Gardner and G. Zhang introduced the radial $p$th mean bodies $R_p K$ of a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $p&gt;-1$, which now play an important role in geometric tomography. In this work, we study the Fourier transforms of the radial functions of $R_p K$. We introduce a new family of star-shaped sets $F_p K$, which we call the Fourier $p$th mean bodies of $K$. We are then interested in the convexity and the relevant affine-isoperimetric inequalities for $F_p K$, as well as connections of $F_p K$ with other classical objects in geometric tomography such as centroid bodies, intersection bodies, and mean zonoids. We also show that the bodies $F_p K$ are, for $p\in (0,1]$, close to ellipsoids in the sense of Hensley's theorem.</description>

      <title>R-hulloid of the vertices of a tetrahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $R$-hulloid, in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, of the set of vertices $V$ of a tetrahedron $T$ is the minimal closed set containing $V$ such that its complement is the union of open balls of radius $R$. When $R$ is greater than the circumradius of $T$, the boundary of the $R$-hulloid consists of $V$ and possibly of four spherical subsets of well defined spheres of radius $R$ through the vertices of $T$. The existence of a value $R^*$ such that these subsets collapse into a point $O^*$, in the interior of $T$, is investigated; in such a case $O^*$ belongs to four spheres of radius $R^*$, each one through three vertices of $T$ and not containing the fourth one. As a consequence, the range of $\rho$ such that $V$ is a $\rho$-body is described completely. This work generalizes to dimension three previous results, proved in the planar case and related to the three circles Johnson's Theorem.</description>

      <title>The G-Gromov-Hausdorff Distance and Equivariant Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each arbitrary finite group $G$, we consider a suitable notion of Gromov Hausdorff distance between compact $G$ metric spaces and derive lower bounds based on equivariant topology methods. As applications, we prove equivariant rigidity and finiteness theorems, and obtain sharp bounds on the Gromov Hausdorff distance between spheres.</description>

      <title>The Christoffel problem for the disk area measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, all but one of them are fixed. We consider the case in which the reference bodies are $(n-1)$-dimensional disks lying in a fixed hyperplane. We obtain an integral representation that reconstructs the support function of a convex body from its disk area measure, without any regularity assumptions. In the smooth setting, we reformulate the problem as a linear differential equation on the sphere, and derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the density of the disk area measure guaranteeing both convexity and regularity of the solution.</description>

      <title>On planar sections of the dodecahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the analysis of three-dimensional biological microstructures such as organoids, microscopy frequently yields two-dimensional optical sections without access to their orientation. Motivated by the question of whether such random planar sections determine the underlying three-dimensional structure, we investigate a discrete analogue in which the ambient structure is the vertex set of a Platonic solid and the observed data are congruence classes of planar intersections. For the regular dodecahedron with vertex set $V$, we define the planar statistic of a subset $X\subseteq V$ of vertices as the distribution of isometry types of inclusions $\Pi\cap X \subseteq \Pi \cap V \subseteq V$, and ask whether this statistic determines $X$ up to isometry. We show that this is not the case: there exist two non-isometric $7$-element subsets with identical planar statistics.
  As a consequence, there exist two polytopes in $\mathbb R^3$, whose distribution of isometry classes of two-dimensional intersections is identical, while the polytopes are not themselves isometric. This result is an analogue of classical non-uniqueness phenomena in geometric tomography.</description>

      <title>A remark on subharmonicity for symmetric Dirichlet forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We remove the local boundedness for $\mathscr{E}_{\alpha}$-subharmonicity in the framework of (not necessarily strongly local) regular symmetric Dirichlet form $(\mathscr{E},D(\mathscr{E}))$ with $\alpha\geq0$ and establish the stochastic characterization for $\mathscr{E}$-subharmonic functions without assuming the local boundedness.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, of Darboux from 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with the finite group of random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$, obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. Explicit examples of random walks with the groups of orders higher than 10 are presented here for the first time, including orders 12, 14, 16. The same method applies to any higher order. We consider cases with singular biquadratics in a systematic manner. We establish a new two-way relationship between diagonal random walks and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar links for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem: after $n$ iterations, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one of the same orientation, that he solved for $n=2$, which was recently extended to $n=3$. We also study $k$-semi-periodicity as a natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing a new object, the secondary $(2,2)$ correspondence, and the related secondary cubic of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form, while the case $k=2$ was solved recently.</description>
