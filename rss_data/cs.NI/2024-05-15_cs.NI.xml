      <title>Slice-aware Resource Allocation and Admission Control for Smart Factory Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) and beyond network offers substantial promise as the ideal wireless technology to replace the existing inflexible wired connections in traditional factories of today. 5G network slicing allows for tailored allocation of resources to different network services, each with unique Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a novel solution for slice-aware radio resource allocation based on a convex optimisation control framework for applications in smart factory wireless networks. The proposed framework dynamically allocates minimum power and sub-channels to downlink mixed service type industrial users categorised into three slices: Capacity Limited (CL), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Time Sensitive (TS) slices. Given that the base station (BS) has limited transmission power, we enforce admission control by effectively relaxing the target rate constraints for current connections in the CL slice. This rate readjustment occurs whenever power consumption exceeds manageable levels. Simulation results show that our approach minimises power, allocates sub-channels to users, maintains slice isolation, and delivers QoS-specific communications to users in all the slices despite time-varying number of users and changing network conditions.</description>

      <title>A Quantum of QUIC: Dissecting Cryptography with Post-Quantum Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QUIC is a new network protocol standardized in 2021. It was designed to replace the TCP/TLS stack and is based on UDP. The most current web standard HTTP/3 is specifically designed to use QUIC as transport protocol. QUIC claims to provide secure and fast transport with low-latency connection establishment, flow and congestion control, reliable delivery, and stream multiplexing. To achieve the security goals, QUIC enforces the usage of TLS 1.3. It uses authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms to not only protect the payload but also parts of the header. The handshake relies on asymmetric cryptography, which will be broken with the introduction of powerful quantum computers, making the use of post-quantum cryptography inevitable. This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the impact of cryptography on QUIC performance. The high-performance QUIC implementations LSQUIC, quiche, and MsQuic are evaluated under different aspects. We break symmetric cryptography down to the different security features. To be able to isolate the impact of cryptography, we implemented a NOOP AEAD algorithm which leaves plaintext unaltered. We show that QUIC performance increases by 10 to 20% when removing packet protection. The header protection has negligible impact on performance, especially for AES ciphers. We integrate post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into QUIC, demonstrating its feasibility without major changes to the QUIC libraries by using a TLS library that implements post-quantum algorithms. Kyber, Dilithium, and FALCON are promising candidates for post-quantum secure QUIC, as they have a low impact on the handshake duration. Algorithms like SPHINCS+ with larger key sizes or more complex calculations significantly impact the handshake duration and cause additional issues in our measurements.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Building Attenuation in 450 MHz LTE Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports on a measurement study to estimate the attenuation of 450 MHz LTE networks. The LTE band 72 is currently deployed in Germany, in particular for smart grid applications. Due to this use-case, we assume that a significant amount of future devices will be deployed stationary and indoor which motivated our campaign. We designed a custom measurement device which uses commercial off-the-shelf hardware to assess the downlink RSRP of a public mobile network. In addition, a software has been developed to provide non-experts the possibility to conduct these measurements in the future. This software provides the possibility to determine the indoor position based on ground plans. We conducted measurements at three different buildings. Our results reveal, that the building attenuation of 450 MHz LTE networks is highly heterogeneous and mainly depends on the type of the building, the indoor position and in particular the height of the floor where the device is located.</description>

      <title>Network Function Capacity Reconnaissance by Remote Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is anecdotal evidence that attackers use reconnaissance to learn the capacity of their victims before DDoS attacks to maximize their impact. The first step to mitigate capacity reconnaissance attacks is to understand their feasibility. However, the feasibility of capacity reconnaissance in network functions (NFs) (e.g., firewalls, NATs) is unknown. To this end, we formulate the problem of network function capacity reconnaissance (NFCR) and explore the feasibility of inferring the processing capacity of an NF while avoiding detection. We identify key factors that make NFCR challenging and analyze how these factors affect accuracy (measured as a divergence from ground truth) and stealthiness (measured in packets sent). We propose a flexible tool, NFTY, that performs NFCR and we evaluate two practical NFTY configurations to showcase the stealthiness vs. accuracy tradeoffs. We evaluate these strategies in controlled, Internet and/or cloud settings with commercial NFs. NFTY can accurately estimate the capacity of different NF deployments within 10% error in the controlled experiments and the Internet, and within 7% error for a commercial NF deployed in the cloud (AWS). Moreover, NFTY outperforms link-bandwidth estimation baselines by up to 30x.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on SmartNICs: Architectures, Development Models, Applications, and Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling has slowed processor improvements in the past decade. While multi-core processors have improved performance, they are limited by the application's level of parallelism, as prescribed by Amdahl's Law. This has led to the emergence of domain-specific processors that specialize in a narrow range of functions. Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) can be seen as an evolutionary technology that combines heterogeneous domain-specific processors and general-purpose cores to offload infrastructure tasks. Despite the impressive advantages of SmartNICs and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides a background encompassing an overview of the evolution of NICs from basic to SmartNICs, describing their architectures, development environments, and advantages over legacy NICs. The paper then presents a comprehensive taxonomy of applications offloaded to SmartNICs, covering network, security, storage, and machine learning functions. Challenges associated with SmartNIC development and deployment are discussed, along with current initiatives and open research issues.</description>

      <title>FLEXIBLE: Forecasting Cellular Traffic by Leveraging Explicit Inductive Graph-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a telecommunication standpoint, the surge in users and services challenges next-generation networks with escalating traffic demands and limited resources. Accurate traffic prediction can offer network operators valuable insights into network conditions and suggest optimal allocation policies. Recently, spatio-temporal forecasting, employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as a promising method for cellular traffic prediction. However, existing studies, inspired by road traffic forecasting formulations, overlook the dynamic deployment and removal of base stations, requiring the GNN-based forecaster to handle an evolving graph. This work introduces a novel inductive learning scheme and a generalizable GNN-based forecasting model that can process diverse graphs of cellular traffic with one-time training. We also demonstrate that this model can be easily leveraged by transfer learning with minimal effort, making it applicable to different areas. Experimental results show up to 9.8% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in rare-data settings with training data reduced to below 20%.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Distribution Delay Optimization in Quantum Networks with Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) distribute entangled states to enable distributed quantum computing and sensing applications. However, in such QNs, quantum switches (QSs) have limited resources that are highly sensitive to noise and losses and must be carefully allocated to minimize entanglement distribution delay. In this paper, a QS resource allocation framework is proposed, which jointly optimizes the average entanglement distribution delay and entanglement distillation operations, to enhance the end-to-end (e2e) fidelity and satisfy minimum rate and fidelity requirements. The proposed framework considers realistic QN noise and includes the derivation of the analytical expressions for the average quantum memory decoherence noise parameter, and the resulting e2e fidelity after distillation. Finally, practical QN deployment aspects are considered, where QSs can control 1) nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center SPS types based on their isotopic decomposition, and 2) nuclear spin regions based on their distance and coupling strength with the electron spin of NV centers. A simulated annealing metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the QS resource allocation optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed framework manages to satisfy all users rate and fidelity requirements, unlike existing distillation-agnostic (DA), minimal distillation (MD), and physics-agnostic (PA) frameworks which do not perform distillation, perform minimal distillation, and does not control the physics-based NV center characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework results in around 30% and 50% reductions in the average e2e entanglement distribution delay compared to existing PA and MD frameworks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed framework results in around 5%, 7%, and 11% reductions in the average e2e fidelity compared to existing DA, PA, and MD frameworks, respectively.</description>

      <title>A first look into Utiq: Next-generation cookies at the ISP level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online privacy has become increasingly important in recent years. While third-party cookies have been widely used for years, they have also been criticized for their potential impact on user privacy. They can be used by advertisers to track users across multiple sites, allowing them to build detailed profiles of their behavior and interests. However, nowadays, many browsers allow users to block third-party cookies, which limits their usefulness for advertisers. In this paper, we take a first look at Utiq, a new way of user tracking performed directly by the ISP, to substitute the third-party cookies used until now. We study the main properties of this new identification methodology and their adoption on the 10K most popular websites. Our results show that, although still marginal due to the restrictions imposed by the system, between 0.7% and 1.2% of websites already include Utiq as one of their user identification methods.</description>

      <title>Reduce to the MACs -- Privacy Friendly Generic Probe Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract. Since the introduction of active discovery in Wi-Fi networks, users can be tracked via their probe requests. Although manufacturers typically try to conceal Media Access Control (MAC) addresses using MAC address randomisation, probe requests still contain Information Elements (IEs) that facilitate device identification. This paper introduces generic probe requests: By removing all unnecessary information from IEs, the requests become indistinguishable from one another, letting single devices disappear in the largest possible anonymity set. Conducting a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that a large IE set contained within undirected probe requests does not necessarily imply fast connection establishment. Furthermore, we show that minimising IEs to nothing but Supported Rates would enable 82.55% of the devices to share the same anonymity set. Our contributions provide a significant advancement in the pursuit of robust privacy solutions for wireless networks, paving the way for more user anonymity and less surveillance in wireless communication ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Tor From Other Encrypted Network Traffic Through Character Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For journalists reporting from a totalitarian regime, whistleblowers and resistance fighters, the anonymous use of cloud services on the Internet can be vital for survival. The Tor network provides a free and widely used anonymization service for everyone. However, there are different approaches to distinguishing Tor from non-Tor encrypted network traffic, most recently only due to the (relative) frequencies of hex digits in a single encrypted payload packet. While conventional data traffic is usually encrypted once, but at least three times in the case of Tor due to the structure and principle of the Tor network, we have examined to what extent the number of encryptions contributes to being able to distinguish Tor from non-Tor encrypted data traffic.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is gradually becoming a reality due to the significant increase in frequency and bandwidth of next-generation wireless communication technologies. Therefore it becomes crucial to evaluate the communication and sensing performance using appropriate channel models to address resource competition from each other. Existing work only models the sensing capability based on the mutual information between the channel response and the received signal, and its theoretical resolution is difficult to support the high-precision requirements of ISAC for sensing tasks, and may even affect its communication optimal.
  In this paper, we propose a sensing channel encoder model to measure the sensing capacity with higher resolution by discrete task mutual information. For the first time, derive upper and lower bounds on the sensing accuracy for a given channel. This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the ISAC systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>

      <title>Tomur: Traffic-Aware Performance Prediction of On-NIC Network Functions with Multi-Resource Contention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network function (NF) offloading on SmartNICs has been widely used in modern data centers, offering benefits in host resource saving and programmability. Co-running NFs on the same SmartNICs can cause performance interference due to onboard resource contention. Therefore, to meet performance SLAs while ensuring efficient resource management, operators need mechanisms to predict NF performance under such contention. However, existing solutions lack SmartNIC-specific knowledge and exhibit limited traffic awareness, leading to poor accuracy for on-NIC NFs. This paper proposes Tomur, a novel performance predictive system for on-NIC NFs. Tomur builds upon the key observation that co-located NFs contend for multiple resources, including onboard accelerators and the memory subsystem. It also facilitates traffic awareness according to the behaviors of individual resources to maintain accuracy as the external traffic attributes vary. Evaluation using BlueField-2 SmartNIC shows that Tomur improves the prediction accuracy by 78.8% and reduces SLA violations by 92.2% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and enables new practical usecases.</description>

      <title>Online Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Intrusion Detection (SSID) framework, which enables a fully online Deep Learning (DL) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that requires no human intervention or prior off-line learning. The proposed framework analyzes and labels incoming traffic packets based only on the decisions of the IDS itself using an Auto-Associative Deep Random Neural Network, and on an online estimate of its statistically measured trustworthiness. The SSID framework enables IDS to adapt rapidly to time-varying characteristics of the network traffic, and eliminates the need for offline data collection. This approach avoids human errors in data labeling, and human labor and computational costs of model training and data collection. The approach is experimentally evaluated on public datasets and compared with well-known {machine learning and deep learning} models, showing that this SSID framework is very useful and advantageous as an accurate and online learning DL-based IDS for IoT systems.</description>
