      <title>Localising invariants in derived bornological geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a nonarchimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>

      <title>Smooth atlas stratified spaces, K-Homology Orientations, and Gysin maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce smooth atlas stratified spaces. We show that this class is closed under cartesian products; consequently, it is possible to define fiber bundles of smooth atlas stratified spaces. We describe the resolution of such a space to a manifold with fibered corners and use this result in order to prove that the class of smooth atlas stratified spaces coincides with that of Thom-Mather stratified spaces.
  We then consider Witt pseudomanifolds (such as singular complex algebraic varieties) where it is well-known that a bordism invariant signature is available and equal to the Fredholm index of a realization of the signature operator. To each oriented fiber bundle of stratified spaces, with Witt fibers, we assign a class in bivariant KK-theory (with 2 inverted). Kasparov multiplication by this element defines a Gysin map in analytic K-homology and one of our main results is that this Gysin map preserves the analytic signature class of Witt spaces. We prove in fact a more general result: functoriality for fiber bundles in the sense that if one fiber bundle is the composition of two others then the KK-class of the former is the Kasparov product of the classes of the latter. We also discuss this result for other Dirac-type operators satisfying an analytic Witt condition, for example the spin-Dirac operator on a fibration of psc-Witt spin pseudomanifolds. We next define the analytic Gysin map associated to an oriented normally non-singular inclusion of Witt spaces and prove that it also preserves the signature class.
  Finally, we relate the analytic signature class of a Witt space with the topological Siegel-Sullivan orientation. Specifically we show that if one applies the inverse of the second Adams operation to the Sullivan orientation and complexifies then one obtains our analytic signature class under the natural identification between analytic and topological K-homology.</description>

      <title>$p$-Biset Functor of Monomial Burnside Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the monomial Burnside biset functor over a field of characteristic zero, with particular focus on its restriction kernels. For each finite \( p \)-group \( G \), we give an explicit description of the restriction kernel at \( G \), and determine the complete list of composition factors of the functor. We prove that these composition factors have minimal groups \( H \) isomorphic either to a cyclic \( p \)-group or to a direct product of such a group with a cyclic group of order \( p \). Furthermore, we identify the simple \( \mathbb{C}[\Aut(H)] \)-modules that appear as evaluations of these composition factors at their minimal groups. Explicit classifications of composition factors for biset functors are rare, and our results provide one of the few complete examples of such classifications.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Decomposition of $\mathbb C^{\times}$-fibered $p$-biset Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Bouc's construction of orthogonal idempotents in the double Burnside algebra to the setting of the double $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered Burnside algebra. This yields a structural decomposition of the evaluations of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered biset functors on finite groups. We then construct a complete set of orthogonal idempotents in the category of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered $p$-biset functors, leading to a categorical decomposition of this category into subcategories indexed by isomorphism classes of atoric $p$-groups. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of vertices for indecomposable functors and establish that the Ext-groups between simple functors with distinct vertices vanish. As an application, we describe a set containing composition factors of the monomial Burnside functor, thereby providing new insights into its structure. Additionally, we develop a technique for analyzing fibered biset functors via their underlying biset structures.</description>
