      <title>Joint Instantaneous Amplitude-Frequency Analysis of Vibration Signals for Vibration-Based Condition Monitoring of Rolling Bearings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrations of damaged bearings are manifested as modulations in the amplitude of the generated vibration signal, making envelope analysis an effective approach for discriminating between healthy and abnormal vibration patterns. Motivated by this, we introduce a low-complexity method for vibration-based condition monitoring (VBCM) of rolling bearings based on envelope analysis. In the proposed method, the instantaneous amplitude (envelope) and instantaneous frequency of the vibration signal are jointly utilized to facilitate three novel envelope representations: instantaneous amplitude-frequency mapping (IAFM), instantaneous amplitude-frequency correlation (IAFC), and instantaneous energy-frequency distribution (IEFD). Maintaining temporal information, these representations effectively capture energy-frequency variations that are unique to the condition of the bearing, thereby enabling the extraction of discriminative features with high sensitivity to variations in operational conditions. Accordingly, six new highly discriminative features are engineered from these representations, capturing and characterizing their shapes. The experimental results show outstanding performance in detecting and diagnosing various fault types, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing unique variations in energy and frequency between healthy and faulty bearings. Moreover, the proposed method has moderate computational complexity, meeting the requirements of real-time applications. Further, the Python code of the proposed method is made public to support collaborative research efforts and ensure the reproducibility of the presented work</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Mulsemedia Communication using Unified Perceiver and Conformal Prediction in 6G Metaverse Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prominence of extended reality (XR), holographic-type communications, and metaverse demands truly immersive user experiences by using many sensory modalities, including sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste, etc. Additionally, the widespread deployment of sensors in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, and smart homes is generating a diverse array of sensory data. A new media format known as multisensory media (mulsemedia) has emerged, which incorporates a wide range of sensory modalities beyond the traditional visual and auditory media. 6G wireless systems are envisioned to support the internet of senses, making it crucial to explore effective data fusion and communication strategies for mulsemedia. In this paper, we introduce a task-oriented multi-task mulsemedia communication system named MuSeCo, which is developed using unified Perceiver models and Conformal Prediction. This unified model can accept any sensory input and efficiently extract latent semantic features, making it adaptable for deployment across various Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices. Conformal Prediction is employed for modality selection and combination, enhancing task accuracy while minimizing data communication overhead. The model has been trained using six sensory modalities across four classification tasks. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that MuSeCo can effectively select and combine sensory modalities, significantly reduce end-to-end communication latency and energy consumption, and maintain high accuracy in communication-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization-based Transmit Beamforming for Multi-Target and Multi-User MIMO-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is an enabling technology for the sixth-generation mobile communications, which equips the wireless communication networks with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate transmit beamforming design for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-ISAC systems in scenarios with multiple radar targets and communication users. A general form of multi-target sensing mutual information (MI) is derived, along with its upper bound, which can be interpreted as the sum of individual single-target sensing MI. Additionally, this upper bound can be achieved by suppressing the cross-correlation among reflected signals from different targets, which aligns with the principles of adaptive MIMO radar. Then, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of each user and the tight upper bound of sensing MI, introducing the Pareto boundary to characterize the achievable communication-sensing performance boundary of the proposed ISAC system. To achieve the Pareto boundary, the max-min system utility function method is employed, while considering the fairness between communication users and radar targets. Subsequently, the bisection search method is employed to find a specific Pareto optimal solution by solving a series of convex feasible problems. Finally, simulation results validate that the proposed method achieves a better tradeoff between multi-user communication and multi-target sensing performance. Additionally, utilizing the tight upper bound of sensing MI as a performance metric can enhance the multi-target resolution capability and angle estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an extremely large-scale massive multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system. As the scale of antenna arrays increases, the range of near-field communications also expands. In this case, the signals no longer exhibit planar wave characteristics but spherical wave characteristics in the near-field channel, which makes the channel state information (CSI) highly complex. Additionally, the increase of the antenna arrays scale also makes the size of the CSI matrix significantly increase. Therefore, CSI feedback in the near-field channel becomes highly challenging. To solve this issue, we propose a deep-learning (DL)-based ExtendNLNet that can compress the CSI, and further reduce the overhead of CSI feedback. In addition, we have introduced the Non-Local block to obtain a larger area of CSI features. Simulation results show that the proposed ExtendNLNet can significantly improve the CSI recovery quality compared to other DL-based methods.</description>

      <title>Interpretable attributed scattering center extracted via deep unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing sparse representation-based approaches for attributed scattering center (ASC) extraction adopt traditional iterative optimization algorithms, which suffer from lengthy computation times and limited precision. This paper presents a solution by introducing an interpretable network that can effectively and rapidly extract ASC via deep unfolding. Initially, we create a dictionary containing reliable prior knowledge and apply it to the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA). Then, we unfold ISTA into a neural network, employing it to autonomously and precisely optimize the hyperparameters. The interpretability of physics is retained by applying a dictionary with physical meaning. The experiments are conducted on multiple test sets with diverse data distributions and demonstrate the superior performance and generalizability of our method.</description>

      <title>Integrated Monostatic Sensing and Full-Duplex Multiuser Communication for mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid precoding/combining framework for communication-centric integrated sensing and full-duplex (FD) communication operating at mmWave bands. The designed precoders and combiners enable multiuser (MU) FD communication while simultaneously supporting monostatic sensing in a frequency-selective setting. The joint design of precoders and combiners involves the mitigation of self-interference (SI) caused by simultaneous transmission and reception at the FD base station (BS). Additionally, MU interference needs to be handled by the precoder/combiner design. The resulting optimization problem involves non-convex constraints since hybrid analog/digital architectures utilize networks of phase shifters. To solve the proposed problem, we separate the optimization of each precoder/combiner, and design each one of them while fixing the others. The precoders at the FD BS are designed by reformulating the communication and sensing constraints as signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization problems that consider SI and MU interference as leakage. Furthermore, we design the frequency-flat analog combiner such that the residual SI at the FD BS is minimized under communication and sensing gain constraints. Finally, we design an interference-aware digital combining stage that separates MU signals and target reflections. The communication performance and sensing results show that the proposed framework efficiently supports both functionalities simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Enabled Cooperative Passive Sensing Using Mobile Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a potential technology of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system, which enables communication base station (BS) with sensing capability. However, the performance of single-BS sensing is limited, which can be overcome by multi-BS cooperative sensing. There are three types of multi-BS cooperative sensing, including cooperative active sensing, cooperative passive sensing, and cooperative active and passive sensing, where the multi-BS cooperative passive sensing has the advantages of low hardware modification cost and large sensing coverage. However, multi-BS cooperative passive sensing faces the challenges of synchronization offsets mitigation and sensing information fusion. To address these challenges, a non-line of sight (NLoS) and line of sight (LoS) signal cross-correlation (NLCC) method is proposed to mitigate carrier frequency offset (CFO) and time offset (TO). Besides, a symbol-level multi-BS sensing information fusion method is proposed. The discrete samplings of echo signals from multiple BSs are matched independently and coherent accumulated to improve sensing accuracy. Moreover, a lowcomplexity joint angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation method is proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that symbol-level multi-BS cooperative passive sensing scheme has an order of magnitude higher sensing accuracy than single-BS passive sensing. This work provides a reference for the research on multi-BS cooperative passive sensing.</description>

      <title>Anchor Layout Optimization for Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning Using Swarm Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor positioning applications are craving for ever higher precision and accuracy across the entire coverage zone. Optimal anchor placement and the deployment of multiple distributed anchor nodes could have a major impact in this regard. This paper examines the influences of these two difficult to approach hypotheses by means of a straightforward ultrasonic 3D indoor positioning system deployed in a real-life scenario via a geometric based simulation framework. To obtain an optimal anchor placement, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced and consequently performed for setups ranging from 4 to 10 anchors. In this way, besides the optimal anchor placement layout, the influence of deploying several distributed anchor nodes is investigated. In order to theoretically compare the optimization progress, a system model and Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are established and the results are quantified based on the simulation data. With limited anchors, the placement is crucial to obtain a high precision high reliability (HPHR) indoor positioning system (IPS), while the addition of anchors, to a lesser extent, gives a supplementary improvement.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Approximations for the Distribution of a Sum of Lognormal Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sum of lognormal random variables (RVs) appears in many problems of science and engineering. For example, it is invloved in computing the distribution of recevied signal and interference powers for radio channels subject to lognormal shadow fading. Its distribution has no closed-from expression and it is typically characterized by approximations, asymptotes or bounds. We give a novel upper bound on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a sum of $N$ lognormal RVs. The bound is derived from the tangential mean-arithmetic mean inequality. By using the tangential mean, our method replaces the sum of $N$ lognormal RVs with a product of $N$ shifted lognormal RVs. It is shown that the bound can be made arbitrarily close to the desired CDF, and thus it becomes more accurate than any other bound or approximation, as the shift approaches infinity. The bound is computed by numerical integration, for which we introduce the Mellin transform, which is applicable to products of RVs. At the left tail of the CDF, the bound can be expressed by a single Q-function. Moreover, we derive simple new approximations to the CDF, expressed as a product $N$ Q-functions, which are more accurate than the previous method of Farley.</description>

      <title>Full-wave EM simulation analysis of human body blockage by dense 2D antenna arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, proposals of human-sensing-based services for cellular and local area networks have brought indoor localization to the attention of several research groups. In response to these stimuli, various Device-Free Localization (DFL) techniques, also known as Passive Localization methods, have emerged by exploiting ambient signals to locate and track individuals that do not carry any electronic device. This study delves into human passive indoor localization through full-wave electromagnetic simulations. For the scope, we exploit simulations from the commercial tool FEKO software that employs the Method of Moments (MoM). In particular, we collect and analyze the electric field values in a scenario constituted by a dense 2D/3D deployment of receivers in the presence of an anthropomorphic mobile target. The paper describes in detail the collected dataset and provides a first analysis based on a statistical approach. Possible use cases are also investigated through examples in the context of passive localization, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the antenna radiation patterns in passive radio sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models based on the scalar diffraction theory allow to predict the impact of subject motions on the radio propagation channel without requiring a time-consuming full-wave approach. On the other hand, they are less effective in complex environments characterized by significant multipath effects. Recently, emerging radio sensing applications have proposed the adoption of smart antennas with non-isotropic radiation characteristics to improve coverage.This letter investigates the impact of antenna radiation patterns in passive radio sensing applications. Adaptations of diffraction-based EM models are proposed to account for antenna non-uniform angular filtering. Next, we quantify experimentally the impact of diffraction and multipath disturbance components on radio sensing accuracy in environments with smart antennas.</description>

      <title>Continuous Multi-Link Operation: A Contention-Free Mechanism for the Unlicensed Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel mechanism to enforce contention-free channel access in the unlicensed spectrum, as opposed to the traditional contention-based approach. To achieve this objective, we build on the Wi-Fi~7 multi-link operation (MLO) and define the means whereby independent channel access attempts are performed in all the addressable links to ensure one available channel/link is ready for transmission at all times, such that a sequence of continuous acquired channels can be maintained. We call this method continuous multi-link operation (ConMLO). In this work, we aim to verify the applicability of ConMLO, its ability to retain spectrum resources for a given duration of time, and its fairness with respect existing approaches, namely legacy single-link operation (SLO) and MLO. To this end, we use realistic data traffic measurements acquired in a crowded football stadium as an exemplary case of challenging spectrum occupation. Our results show that the proposed ConMLO can effectively guarantee continuous channel acquisition under different occupancy scenarios without compromising fairness of channel access compared to existing legacy modes.</description>

      <title>Outlier-resilient model fitting via percentile losses: Methods for general and convex residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of robustly fitting a model to data that includes outliers by formulating a percentile optimization problem. This problem is non-smooth and non-convex, hence hard to solve. We derive properties that the minimizers of such problems must satisfy. These properties lead to methods that solve the percentile formulation both for general residuals and for convex residuals. The methods fit the model to subsets of the data, and then extract the solution of the percentile formulation from these partial fits. As illustrative simulations show, such methods endure higher outlier percentages, when compared with standard robust estimates. Additionally, the derived properties provide a broader and alternative theoretical validation for existing robust methods, whose validity was previously limited to specific forms of the residuals.</description>

      <title>Non-contact Lung Disease Classification via OFDM-based Passive 6G ISAC Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first to present a novel, non-contact method that utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals (of frequency 5.23 GHz, emitted by a software defined radio) to radio-expose the pulmonary patients in order to differentiate between five prevalent respiratory diseases, i.e., Asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Interstitial lung disease (ILD), Pneumonia (PN), and Tuberculosis (TB). The fact that each pulmonary disease leads to a distinct breathing pattern, and thus modulates the OFDM signal in a different way, motivates us to acquire OFDM-Breathe dataset, first of its kind. It consists of 13,920 seconds of raw RF data (at 64 distinct OFDM frequencies) that we have acquired from a total of 116 subjects in a hospital setting (25 healthy control subjects, and 91 pulmonary patients). Among the 91 patients, 25 have Asthma, 25 have COPD, 25 have TB, 5 have ILD, and 11 have PN. We implement a number of machine and deep learning models in order to do lung disease classification using OFDM-Breathe dataset. The vanilla convolutional neural network outperforms all the models with an accuracy of 97%, and stands out in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. The ablation study reveals that it is sufficient to radio-observe the human chest on seven different microwave frequencies only, in order to make a reliable diagnosis (with 96% accuracy) of the underlying lung disease. This corresponds to a sensing overhead that is merely 10.93% of the allocated bandwidth. This points to the feasibility of 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems of future where 89.07% of bandwidth still remains available for information exchange amidst on-demand health sensing. Through 6G ISAC, this work provides a tool for mass screening for respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19) at public places.</description>

Abstract: Task-oriented communication aims to extract and transmit task-relevant information to significantly reduce the communication overhead and transmission latency. However, the unpredictable distribution shifts between training and test data, including domain shift and semantic shift, can dramatically undermine the system performance. In order to tackle these challenges, it is crucial to ensure that the encoded features can generalize to domain-shifted data and detect semanticshifted data, while remaining compact for transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the information bottleneck (IB) principle and invariant risk minimization (IRM) framework. The proposed method aims to extract compact and informative features that possess high capability for effective domain-shift generalization and accurate semantic-shift detection without any knowledge of the test data during training. Specifically, we propose an invariant feature encoding approach based on the IB principle and IRM framework for domainshift generalization, which aims to find the causal relationship between the input data and task result by minimizing the complexity and domain dependence of the encoded feature. Furthermore, we enhance the task-oriented communication with the label-dependent feature encoding approach for semanticshift detection which achieves joint gains in IB optimization and detection performance. To avoid the intractable computation of the IB-based objective, we leverage variational approximation to derive a tractable upper bound for optimization. Extensive simulation results on image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves a better rate-distortion tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Sleep Mode Optimization of 5G mmWave Networks Using Deep Contextual MAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, integral to 5G communication, offer a vast spectrum that addresses the issue of spectrum scarcity and enhances peak rate and capacity. However, their dense deployment, necessary to counteract propagation losses, leads to high power consumption. An effective strategy to reduce this energy consumption in mobile networks is the sleep mode optimization (SMO) of base stations (BSs). In this paper, we propose a novel SMO approach for mmWave BSs in a 3D urban environment. This approach, which incorporates a neural network (NN) based contextual multi-armed bandit (C-MAB) with an epsilon decay algorithm, accommodates the dynamic and diverse traffic of user equipment (UE) by clustering the UEs in their respective tracking areas (TAs). Our strategy includes beamforming, which helps reduce energy consumption from the UE side, while SMO minimizes energy use from the BS perspective. We extended our investigation to include Random, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Load Based sleep mode (SM) strategies. We compared the performance of our proposed C-MAB based SM algorithm with those of All On and other alternative approaches. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms all other SM strategies in terms of the $10^{th}$ percentile of user rate and average throughput while demonstrating comparable average throughput to the All On approach. Importantly, it outperforms all approaches in terms of energy efficiency (EE).</description>

      <title>Analytical Characterization of the Operational Diversity Order in Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and characterize the operational diversity order (ODO) in fading channels, as a proxy to the classical notion of diversity order at any arbitrary operational signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thanks to this definition, relevant insights are brought up in a number of cases: (i) We quantify that in line-of-sight scenarios an increased diversity order is attainable compared to that achieved asymptotically; (ii) this effect is attenuated, but still visible, in the presence of an additional dominant specular component; (iii) we confirm that the decay slope in Rayleigh product channels increases very slowly and never fully achieves unitary slope for finite values of SNR.</description>

      <title>Robust Covariance-Based Activity Detection for Massive Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wireless channel is undergoing continuous changes, and the block-fading assumption, despite its popularity in theoretical contexts, never holds true in practical scenarios. This discrepancy is particularly critical for user activity detection in grant-free random access, where joint processing across multiple resource blocks is usually undesirable. In this paper, we propose employing a low-dimensional approximation of the channel to capture variations over time and frequency and robustify activity detection algorithms. This approximation entails projecting channel fading vectors onto their principal directions to minimize the approximation order. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate a substantial performance improvement achieved by the resulting activity detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Joint Azimuth-Range-Velocity Estimation for Integrated Sensing and Communication with OFDM Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a main application scenario of the sixth-generation mobile communication systems. Due to the fast-growing number of antennas and subcarriers in cellular systems, the computational complexity of joint azimuth-range-velocity estimation (JARVE) in ISAC systems is extremely high. This paper studies the JARVE problem for a monostatic ISAC system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, in which a base station receives the echos of its transmitted cellular OFDM signals to sense multiple targets. The Cramer-Rao bounds are first derived for JARVE. A low-complexity algorithm is further designed for super-resolution JARVE, which utilizes the proposed iterative subspace update scheme and Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method to replace the exhaustive search of spatial spectrum in multiple-signal-classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Finally, with the practical parameters of 5G New Radio, simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational complexity by three orders of magnitude and two orders of magnitude compared to the existing three-dimensional MUSIC algorithm and estimation-of-signal-parameters-using-rotational-invariance-techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, respectively, and also improve the estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Towards the limits: Sensing Capability Measurement for ISAC Through Channel Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is gradually becoming a reality due to the significant increase in frequency and bandwidth of next-generation wireless communication technologies. Therefore it becomes crucial to evaluate the communication and sensing performance using appropriate channel models to address resource competition from each other. Existing work only models the sensing capability based on the mutual information between the channel response and the received signal, and its theoretical resolution is difficult to support the high-precision requirements of ISAC for sensing tasks, and may even affect its communication optimal.
  In this paper, we propose a sensing channel encoder model to measure the sensing capacity with higher resolution by discrete task mutual information. For the first time, derive upper and lower bounds on the sensing accuracy for a given channel. This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the ISAC systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).</description>

      <title>Calibrating Wireless Ray Tracing for Digital Twinning using Local Phase Error Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodying the principle of simulation intelligence, digital twin (DT) systems construct and maintain a high-fidelity virtual model of a physical system. This paper focuses on ray tracing (RT), which is widely seen as an enabling technology for DTs of the radio access network (RAN) segment of next-generation disaggregated wireless systems. RT makes it possible to simulate channel conditions, enabling data augmentation and prediction-based transmission. However, the effectiveness of RT hinges on the adaptation of the electromagnetic properties assumed by the RT to actual channel conditions, a process known as calibration. The main challenge of RT calibration is the fact that small discrepancies in the geometric model fed to the RT software hinder the accuracy of the predicted phases of the simulated propagation paths. Existing solutions to this problem either rely on the channel power profile, hence disregarding phase information, or they operate on the channel responses by assuming the simulated phases to be sufficiently accurate for calibration. This paper proposes a novel channel response-based scheme that, unlike the state of the art, estimates and compensates for the phase errors in the RT-generated channel responses. The proposed approach builds on the variational expectation maximization algorithm with a flexible choice of the prior phase-error distribution that bridges between a deterministic model with no phase errors and a stochastic model with uniform phase errors. The algorithm is computationally efficient, and is demonstrated, by leveraging the open-source differentiable RT software available within the Sionna library, to outperform existing methods in terms of the accuracy of RT predictions.</description>

Abstract: It is critical to design efficient beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for enhancing spectrum utilization. However, conventional methods often have limitations, either incurring high computational complexity due to iterative algorithms or sacrificing performance when using heuristic methods. To achieve both low complexity and high spectrum efficiency, an unsupervised learning-based beamforming design is proposed in this work. We tailor image-shaped channel samples and develop an ISAC beamforming neural network (IBF-Net) model for beamforming. By leveraging unsupervised learning, the loss function incorporates key performance metrics like sensing and communication channel correlation and sensing channel gain, eliminating the need of labeling. Simulations show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to benchmarks while significantly reduces computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Physical Layer Security with Deep SIMO Auto-Encoder and RF Impairments Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to achieving secure wireless communication by leveraging the inherent characteristics of wireless channels through end-to-end learning using a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) autoencoder (AE). To ensure a more realistic signal transmission, we derive the signal model that captures all radio frequency (RF) hardware impairments to provide reliable and secure communication. Performance evaluations against traditional linear decoders, such as zero-forcing (ZR) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and the optimal nonlinear decoder, maximum likelihood (ML), demonstrate that the AE-based SIMO model exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance, but with a substantial gap even in the presence of RF hardware impairments. Additionally, the proposed model offers enhanced security features, preventing potential eavesdroppers from intercepting transmitted information and leveraging RF impairments for augmented physical layer security and device identification. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end learning approach in achieving secure and robust wireless communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research paper explores ways to apply Federated Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) techniques to population-scale Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The study learns a multi-label ECG classification model using FL and DP based on 1,565,849 ECG tracings from 7 hospitals in Alberta, Canada. The FL approach allowed collaborative model training without sharing raw data between hospitals while building robust ECG classification models for diagnosing various cardiac conditions. These accurate ECG classification models can facilitate the diagnoses while preserving patient confidentiality using FL and DP techniques. Our results show that the performance achieved using our implementation of the FL approach is comparable to that of the pooled approach, where the model is trained over the aggregating data from all hospitals. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hospitals with limited ECGs for training can benefit from adopting the FL model compared to single-site training. In addition, this study showcases the trade-off between model performance and data privacy by employing DP during model training. Our code is available at https://github.com/vikhyatt/Hospital-FL-DP.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) body models designed to predict Radio-Frequency (RF) propagation are time-consuming methods which prevent their adoption in strict real-time computational imaging problems, such as human body localization and sensing. Physics-informed Generative Neural Network (GNN) models have been recently proposed to reproduce EM effects, namely to simulate or reconstruct missing data or samples by incorporating relevant EM principles and constraints. The paper discusses a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) model which is trained to reproduce the effects of human motions on the EM field and incorporate EM body diffraction principles. Proposed physics-informed generative neural network models are verified against both classical diffraction-based EM tools and full-wave EM body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High quality measurements are paramount to a successful application of experimental techniques in structural dynamics. The presence of noise and disturbances can significantly distort the information stored in the data and, if not adequately treated, may result in erroneous findings and misleading predictions. A common technique to filter out noise relies on decomposing the dataset into singular components sorted by their degree of significance. Discarding low-value contributions helps to clean the data and remove spuriousness. This paper presents PRANK, a novel singular value-based reconstruction approach for multiple-response vibration datasets. PRANK integrates the effect of Principal Response Functions and Hankel filtering actions, resulting in an improved data reconstruction for both system poles and zeros. The mixed formulation, incorporating the e-15 algorithm for automatic truncation, is tested on both analytical and numerical examples, showcasing its robustness, efficiency and versatility. PRANK operates with both time- and frequency-based data. Applied to noisy full-field camera measurements, the filter delivered excellent performance, indicating its potential for various identification tasks and applications in vibration analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new Neural Network stochastic model to generate a 1-dimensional stochastic field with turbulent velocity statistics. Both the model architecture and training procedure ground on the Kolmogorov and Obukhov statistical theories of fully developed turbulence, so guaranteeing descriptions of 1) energy distribution, 2) energy cascade and 3) intermittency across scales in agreement with experimental observations. The model is a Generative Adversarial Network with multiple multiscale optimization criteria. First, we use three physics-based criteria: the variance, skewness and flatness of the increments of the generated field that retrieve respectively the turbulent energy distribution, energy cascade and intermittency across scales. Second, the Generative Adversarial Network criterion, based on reproducing statistical distributions, is used on segments of different length of the generated field. Furthermore, to mimic multiscale decompositions frequently used in turbulence's studies, the model architecture is fully convolutional with kernel sizes varying along the multiple layers of the model. To train our model we use turbulent velocity signals from grid turbulence at Modane wind tunnel.</description>

      <title>Robust mmWave/sub-THz multi-connectivity using minimal coordination and coarse synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates simpler alternatives to coherent joint transmission for supporting robust connectivity against signal blockage in mmWave/sub-THz access networks. By taking an information-theoretic viewpoint, we demonstrate analytically that with a careful design, full macrodiversity gains and significant SNR gains can be achieved through canonical receivers and minimal coordination and synchronization requirements at the infrastructure side. Our proposed scheme extends non-coherent joint transmission by employing a special form of diversity to counteract artificially induced deep fades that would otherwise make this technique often compare unfavorably against standard transmitter selection schemes. Additionally, the inclusion of an Alamouti-like space-time coding layer is shown to recover a significant fraction of the optimal performance. Our conclusions are based on an insightful multi-point intermittent block fading channel model that enables rigorous ergodic and outage rate analysis, while also considering timing offsets due to imperfect delay compensation. Although simplified, our approach captures the essential features of modern mmWave/sub-THz communications, thereby providing practical design guidelines for realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks with Blockage Effects</title>

Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>
