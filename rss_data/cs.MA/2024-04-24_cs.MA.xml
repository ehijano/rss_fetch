      <title>Opinion Update in a Subjective Logic Model for Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective Logic (SL) is a logic incorporating uncertainty and opinions for agents in dynamic systems. In this work, we investigate the use of subjective logic to model opinions and belief change in social networks. In particular, we work toward the development of a subjective logic belief/opinion update function appropriate for modeling belief change as communication occurs in social networks. We found through experiments that an update function with belief fusion from SL does not have ideal properties to represent a rational update. Even without these properties, we found that an update function with cumulative belief fusion can describe behaviors not explored by the social network model defined by Alvim, Knight, and Valencia (2019).</description>

      <title>From Space-Time to Space-Order: Directly Planning a Temporal Planning Graph by Redefining CBS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods compute collision-free space-time paths which require agents to be at a specific location at a specific discretized timestep. However, executing these space-time paths directly on robotic systems is infeasible due to real-time execution differences (e.g. delays) which can lead to collisions. To combat this, current methods translate the space-time paths into a temporal plan graph (TPG) that only requires that agents observe the order in which they navigate through locations where their paths cross. However, planning space-time paths and then post-processing them into a TPG does not reduce the required agent-to-agent coordination, which is fixed once the space-time paths are computed. To that end, we propose a novel algorithm Space-Order CBS that can directly plan a TPG and explicitly minimize coordination. Our main theoretical insight is our novel perspective on viewing a TPG as a set of space-visitation order paths where agents visit locations in relative orders (e.g. 1st vs 2nd) as opposed to specific timesteps. We redefine unique conflicts and constraints for adapting CBS for space-order planning. We experimentally validate how Space-Order CBS can return TPGs which significantly reduce coordination, thus subsequently reducing the amount of agent-agent communication and leading to more robustness to delays during execution.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Cascading Effects in Large Adversarial Graph Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of society's infrastructure can be modeled using graph structures, from electric and communication grids, to traffic networks, to social networks. Each of these domains are also susceptible to the cascading spread of negative impacts, whether this be overloaded devices in the power grid or the reach of a social media post containing misinformation. The potential harm of a cascade is compounded when considering a malicious attack by an adversary that is intended to maximize the cascading impact. However, by exploiting knowledge of the cascading dynamics, targets with the largest cascading impact can be preemptively prioritized for defense, and the damage an adversary can inflict can be mitigated. While game theory provides tools for finding an optimal preemptive defense strategy, existing methods struggle to scale to the context of large graph environments because of the combinatorial explosion of possible actions that occurs when the attacker and defender can each choose multiple targets in the graph simultaneously. The proposed method enables a data-driven deep learning approach that uses multi-node representation learning and counterfactual data augmentation to generalize to the full combinatorial action space by training on a variety of small restricted subsets of the action space. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is capable of identifying defense strategies that are less exploitable than SOTA methods for large graphs, while still being able to produce strategies near the Nash equilibrium for small-scale scenarios for which it can be computed. Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy on a validation set of unseen cascades compared to other deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Estimation Network Design framework for efficient distributed optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed decision problems features a group of agents that can only communicate over a peer-to-peer network, without a central memory. In applications such as network control and data ranking, each agent is only affected by a small portion of the decision vector: this sparsity is typically ignored in distributed algorithms, while it could be leveraged to improve efficiency and scalability. To address this issue, our recent paper introduces Estimation Network Design (END), a graph theoretical language for the analysis and design of distributed iterations. END algorithms can be tuned to exploit the sparsity of specific problem instances, reducing communication overhead and minimizing redundancy, yet without requiring case-by-case convergence analysis. In this paper, we showcase the flexility of END in the context of distributed optimization. In particular, we study the sparsity-aware version of many established methods, including ADMM, AugDGM and Push-Sum DGD. Simulations on an estimation problem in sensor networks demonstrate that END algorithms can boost convergence speed and greatly reduce the communication and memory cost.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Cooperative Underwater Multi-Target Tracking Based on Dynamic-Switching-enabled Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of underwater communication, sensing, automation, robot technologies, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarms are gradually becoming popular and have been widely promoted in ocean exploration and underwater tracking or surveillance, etc. However, the complex underwater environment poses significant challenges for AUV swarm-based accurate tracking for the underwater moving targets. In this paper, we aim at proposing a multi-AUV cooperative underwater multi-target tracking algorithm especially when the real underwater factors are taken into account.We first give normally modelling approach for the underwater sonar-based detection and the ocean current interference on the target tracking process.Then, we regard the AUV swarm as a underwater ad-hoc network and propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) architecture towards the AUV swarm based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN).It enhances the flexibility and scalability of the AUV swarm through centralized management and distributed operations.Based on the proposed MARL architecture, we propose the "dynamic-attention switching" and "dynamic-resampling switching" mechanisms, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of AUV swarm cooperation during task execution.Finally, based on a proposed AUV classification method, we propose an efficient cooperative tracking algorithm called ASMA.Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed tracking algorithm can perform precise underwater multi-target tracking, comparing with many of recent research products in terms of convergence speed and tracking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Synthetic Participatory Planning of Synergistic Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation systems.</description>
