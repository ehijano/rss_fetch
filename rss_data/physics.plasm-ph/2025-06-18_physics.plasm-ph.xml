      <title>Numerical Modeling of n-Hexane Pyrolysis with an Optimized Kinetic Mechanism in a Hydrogen Plasma Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physicochemical mechanisms underlying the pyrolysis of n-hexane in a high temperature Ar-H2 environment were investigated for plasma pyrolysis process. An optimal chemical kinetics model was developed using the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), an automated tool for constructing reaction mechanisms. This model was validated through 0-D analyses, where simulation result were compared with existing kinetic models (LLNL,JetSurf) and experimental data from conventional n-hexane pyrolysis. Subsequently, 1-D analysis were conducted to identify the optimal operational flow rate in plasma pyrolysis reactor, the results of which informed detailed three-dimensional (2-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the plasma reactor. The CFD simulations reveal that fluid mixing dynamics play a dominant role in determining the extent of conversion and product selectivity, highlighting the limitations of lower-dimensional models in capturing essential transport phenomena. Notably, the simulations indicate a higher C2 monomer selectivity of approximately 50 % under plasma-based n-hexane pyrolysis, in contrast to the roughly 30 % selectivity achieved via conventional fossil-fuel-based methods. These findings underscore the potential advantages of plasma-driven pyrolysis and represent a critical step toward a comprehensive understanding of the complex thermochemical behavior governing plasma-assisted processes.</description>

      <title>Embedding physical symmetries into machine-learned reduced plasma physics models via data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is offering powerful new tools for the development and discovery of reduced models of nonlinear, multiscale plasma dynamics from the data of first-principles kinetic simulations. However, ensuring the physical consistency of such models requires embedding fundamental symmetries of plasma dynamics. In this work, we explore a symmetry-embedding strategy based on data augmentation, where symmetry-preserving transformations (e.g., Lorentz and Galilean boosts) are applied to simulation data. Using both sparse regression and neural networks, we show that models trained on symmetry-augmented data more accurately infer the plasma fluid equations and pressure tensor closures from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. We show that this approach suppresses spurious inertial-frame-dependent correlations between dynamical variables, improves data efficiency, and significantly outperforms models trained without symmetry-augmented data, as well as commonly used theoretical pressure closure models. Our results establish symmetry-based data augmentation as a broadly applicable method for incorporating physical structure into machine-learned reduced plasma models.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability at Tangential Discontinuities in Partially Ionized Plasma: Application to Heliopause Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of the heliopause, the tangential discontinuity separating the solar wind from the interstellar medium, is influenced by various processes, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This study investigates the role of charge exchange collisions between protons and hydrogen (H) atoms in reduction of the Kelvin-Helmholtz growth rate at the heliopause. Using a two-dimensional gasdynamic model with the inclusion of H atoms, we perform numerical simulations of the plasma flow near the heliopause flanks. We conduct a parametric study by varying the Knudsen number. Our results indicate that charge exchange collisions play a crucial role in suppressing the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. As the Knudsen number decreases, the flow transitions from an unstable regime to a smoother state.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Ionization and Recombination Processes in Plasma with Arbitrary Non-Maxwellian Electron Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astronomical environments, the high-temperature emission of plasma mainly depends on ion charge states, which requires accurate analysis of the ionization and recombination processes. For various phenomena involving energetic particles, the non-Maxwellian distributions of electrons exhibiting high-energy tails can significantly enhance the ionization process. Therefore, accurately computing ionization and recombination rates with non-Maxwellian electron distributions is essential for emission diagnostic analysis. In this work, we report two methods for fitting various non-Maxwellian distributions by using the Maxwellian decomposition strategy. For standard \{kappa} distributions, the calculated ionization and recombination rate coefficients show comparable accuracy to other public packages. We apply the above methods to two specific non-Maxwellian distribution scenarios: (I) accelerated electron distributions due to magnetic reconnection revealed in a combined MHD-particle simulation; (II) the high-energy truncated \{kappa} distribution predicted by the exospheric model of the solar wind. During the electron acceleration process, ionization rates of high-temperature iron ions increase significantly compared to their initial Maxwellian distribution, while the recombination rates may decrease due to the electron distribution changes in low-energy ranges. This can potentially lead to an overestimation of the plasma temperature when analyzing the Fe emission lines under the Maxwellian distribution assumption. For the truncated \{kappa} distribution in the solar wind, the ionization rates are lower than those for the standard \{kappa} distribution, while the recombination rates remain similar. This leads to an overestimation of plasma temperature when assuming a \{kappa} distribution.</description>

      <title>Effects of transitional orbit magnetization on transport and current in Z pinches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The azimuthal self-magnetic field of the ideal Z pinch contains a central magnetic null. Trajectories around this null govern transport in the core. Particles follow cyclotron orbits when the guiding-center approximation holds. Approaching the field null, where the ordinary guiding-center regime breaks down, particles exhibit trajectories called, in some historical contexts, betatron orbits. We quantify transitional magnetization between cyclotron and betatron orbits by a magnetization parameter that decomposes phase space into these orbit regimes. Considering the distribution of all orbits, this phase-space decomposition reveals a transitional magnetization region wherein both populations coexist. Classical magnetized transport theory fails within this region, where the diamagnetic drift reverses. The drift flux is instead supported by the flux of betatron orbits. Kinematic diffusivity remains approximately constant rather than diverging at the null. These transport modifications are governed solely by the number density per unit length in the ideal pinch.</description>

      <title>Complex pseudo-partition functions in the Configurationally-Resolved Super-Transition-Array approach for radiative opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few years ago, Kurzweil and Hazak developed the Configurationally Resolved Super-Transition-Arrays (CRSTA) method for the computation of hot-plasma radiative opacity. Their approach, based on a temporal integration, is an important refinement of the standard Super-Transition-Arrays (STA) approach, which enables one to recover the underlying structure of the STAs, made of unresolved transition arrays. The CRSTA formalism relies on the use of complex pseudo partition functions, depending on the considered one-electron jump. In this article, we find that, despite the imaginary part, the doubly-recursive relation which was introduced in the original STA method to avoid problems due to alternating-sign terms in partition functions, is still applicable, robust, efficient, and exempt of numerical instabilities. This was rather unexpected, in particular because of the occurrence of trigonometric functions, or Chebyshev polynomials, which can be either positive or negative. We also show that, in the complex case, the recursion relation can be presented in a form where the vector of real and imaginary parts at a given iteration is therefore obtained by a sum of the rotated previous ones.</description>
