      <title>On finite dimensional regular gradings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an associative algebra over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic 0. A decomposition $A=A_1\oplus\cdots \oplus A_r$ of $A$ into a direct sum of $r$ vector subspaces is called a \textsl{regular decomposition} if, for every $n$ and every $1\le i_j\le r$, there exist $a_{i_j}\in A_{i_j}$ such that $a_{i_1}\cdots a_{i_n}\ne 0$, and moreover, for every $1\le i,j\le r$ there exists a constant $\beta(i,j)\in K^*$ such that $a_ia_j=\beta(i,j)a_ja_i$ for every $a_i\in A_i$, $A_j\in A_j$. We work with decompositions determined by gradings on $A$ by a finite abelian group $G$. In this case, the function $\beta\colon G\times G\to K^*$ ought to be a bicharacter. A regular decomposition is {minimal} whenever for every $g$, $h\in G$, the equalities $\beta(x,g)=\beta(x,h)$ for every $x\in G$ imply $g=h$. In this paper we describe the finite dimensional algebras $A$ admitting a $G$-grading such that the corresponding regular decomposition is minimal. Moreover we compute the graded codimension sequence of these algebras. It turns out that the graded PI exponent of every finite dimensional $G$-graded algebra with regular grading such that its regular decomposition is minimal, coincides with its ordinary (ungraded) PI exponent.</description>

      <title>Partially Alternative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel generalization of the classical property of algebras known as "being alternative," which we term "partially alternative." This new concept broadens the scope of alternative algebras, offering a fresh perspective on their structural properties. We showed that partially alternative algebras exist in any even dimension. Then we classified middle $\mathbb C$-associative (noncommutative) algebras satisfying partial alternativity condition. We demonstrated that for any four-dimensional partially alternative real division algebra, one can select a basis that significantly simplifies its multiplication table. Furthermore, we established that every four-dimensional partially alternative real division algebra naturally gives rise to a real Lie algebra, thereby bridging these two important algebraic frameworks. Our work culminates in a description of all Lie algebras arising from such partially alternative algebras. These results extend our understanding of algebraic structures and reveal new connections between different types of algebras.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative bases and commutative semiartinian von Neumann regular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a semiartinian (von Neumann) regular ring with primitive factors artinian. An invariant of $R$ called the dimension sequence $\mathcal D$ was defined in ~\cite{RTZ} in order to capture the various skew-fields and dimensions occurring in the layers of the socle sequence of $R$. We show that in the particular case when $K$ is a field and $R$ is a commutative semiartinian regular $K$-algebra of countable type, $\mathcal D$ determines the structure of $R$ uniquely up to a $K$-algebra isomorphism. Our proof is constructive: given the sequence $\mathcal D$, we construct the unique $K$-algebra $R$ of countable type by a transfinite iterative construction from the base case of the $K$-algebra $B(\aleph_0,K)$ consisting of all eventually constant sequences in $K^\omega$. As a corollary, we obtain that each commutative semiartinian regular $K$-algebra of countable type has a conormed multiplicative basis. In the final section, we answer in the positive an old question of Paul Eklof by showing the existence of strictly $\lambda$-injective modules for all infinite cardinals $\lambda$. Such modules exist over the $K$-algebra $B(\kappa,K)$ for each cardinal $\kappa \geq \lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we review the Takeuchi correspondence between right coideal subalgebras and left $H$-module factor coalgebras of a Hopf algebra with bijective antipode. We are especially interested to describe the situation when the faithfulness assumption in the conditions of flatness and coflatness is dropped. This study was motivated by several questions which remain open.</description>

      <title>Adjointable maps between linear orthosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, the collection $P(H)$ of at most one-dimensional subspaces of $H$, equipped with the orthogonal relation $\perp$ and the zero linear subspace $\{0\}$, is a linear orthoset and up to orthoisomorphism any linear orthoset of rank $\geq 4$ arises in this way. We investigate in this paper the correspondence of structure-preserving maps between Hermitian spaces on the one hand and between the associated linear orthosets on the other hand. Our particular focus is on adjointable maps.
  We show that, under a mild assumption, adjointable maps between linear orthosets are induced by quasilinear maps between Hermitian spaces and if the latter are linear, they are adjointable as well. Specialised versions of this correlation lead to Wigner-type theorems; we see, for instance, that orthoisomorphisms between the orthosets associated with at least $3$-dimensional Hermitian spaces are induced by quasiunitary maps.
  In addition, we point out that orthomodular spaces of dimension $\geq 4$ can be characterised as irreducible Fr\'echet orthosets such that the inclusion map of any subspace is adjointable. Together with a transitivity condition, we may in this way describe the infinite-dimensional classical Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <title>Euclidean domains with no multiplicative norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Euclidean domain with no multiplicative Euclidean norm to a compatibly well-ordered monoid, and hence with no multiplicative Euclidean norm to $\mathbb{R}$ (under its usual order).
  A key step in the proof is showing that the UFD property is preserved when adjoining a free factorization.</description>

      <title>Quillen (co)homology of divided power algebras over an operad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barr--Beck cohomology, put into the framework of model categories by Quillen, provides a cohomology theory for any algebraic structure, for example Andr\'e--Quillen cohomology of commutative rings. Quillen cohomology has been studied notably for divided power algebras and restricted Lie algebras, both of which are instances of divided power algebras over an operad $P$: the commutative and Lie operad respectively. In this paper, we investigate the Quillen cohomology of divided power algebras over an operad $P$, identifying Beck modules, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials in that setup. We also compare the cohomology of divided power algebras over $P$ with that of $P$-algebras, and work out some examples.</description>

      <title>A multiplicative surface signature through its Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, the concept of path signature has achieved significant success in data science applications. It offers a powerful set of features that effectively capture and describe the characteristics of paths or sequential data. This is partly explained by the fact that the signature of a path can be computed in linear time, using a dynamic programming principle based on Chen's identity. The path signature can be viewed as a specific example of a product or time-/path-ordered integral. In other words, it represents a one-parameter object built on iterated integrals over a path.
  Defining a signature over surfaces requires considering iterated integrals over these surfaces, effectively introducing an additional parameter, resulting in a two-parameter signature. This extended signature is intrinsically connected to a non-commutative generalization of Stokes' theorem, which is fundamentally connected to the concept of crossed modules of groups. The latter provides a well-established framework in higher gauge theory, where crossed modules with feedback maps exhibiting non-trivial kernels, combined with multiparameter iterated integrals, play a pivotal role.
  Building on Kapranov's work, we explore the surface analog of the log-signature for paths by introducing a Magnus-type formula for the logarithm of the surface signature. This expression takes values in a free crossed module of Lie algebras, defined over a free Lie algebra. We furthermore prove a non-commutative sewing lemma applicable to the crossed module setting and give a definition of rough surface in the so-called Young-H\"older regularity regime along with a corresponding continuous extension theorem. This approach enables the analysis and computation of surface features that go beyond what can be expressed by computing line integrals along the boundary of a surface.</description>

      <title>Characteristically nilpotent Lie groups with flat coadjoint orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of certain characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras with flat coadjoint orbits. Their connected, simply connected Lie groups admit square-integrable representations modulo the center. There are many examples of nilpotent Lie groups admitting families of dilations and square-integrable representations. Much less is known about examples admitting square-integrable representations for which the quotient by the center does not admit a family of dilations. In this paper we construct a two-parameter family of characteristically nilpotent Lie groups $G(\alpha,\beta)$ in dimension $11$, admitting square-integrable representations modulo the center $Z$, such that $G(\alpha,\beta)/Z$ does not admit a family of dilations.</description>
