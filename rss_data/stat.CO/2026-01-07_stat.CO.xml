      <title>Bayesian Multiple Multivariate Density-Density Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first approach for multiple multivariate density-density regression (MDDR), making it possible to consider the regression of a multivariate density-valued response on multiple multivariate density-valued predictors. The core idea is to define a fitted distribution using a sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) of push-forwards of the predictors and to quantify deviations from the observed response using the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. Regression functions, which map predictors' supports to the response support, and barycenter weights are inferred within a generalized Bayes framework, enabling principled uncertainty quantification without requiring a fully specified likelihood. The inference process can be seen as an instance of an inverse SWB problem. We establish theoretical guarantees, including the stability of the SWB under perturbations of marginals and barycenter weights, sample complexity of the generalized likelihood, and posterior consistency. For practical inference, we introduce a differentiable approximation of the SWB and a smooth reparameterization to handle the simplex constraint on barycenter weights, allowing efficient gradient-based MCMC sampling. We demonstrate MDDR in an application to inference for population-scale single-cell data. Posterior analysis under the MDDR model in this example includes inference on communication between multiple source/sender cell types and a target/receiver cell type. The proposed approach provides accurate fits, reliable predictions, and interpretable posterior estimates of barycenter weights, which can be used to construct sparse cell-cell communication networks.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ultra-High-Dimensional Quantile Regression with Genomic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern datasets arising from social media, genomics, and biomedical informatics are often heterogeneous and (ultra) high-dimensional, creating substantial challenges for conventional modeling techniques. Quantile regression (QR) not only offers a flexible way to capture heterogeneous effects across the conditional distribution of an outcome, but also naturally produces prediction intervals that help quantify uncertainty in future predictions. However, classical QR methods can face serious memory and computational constraints in large-scale settings. These limitations motivate the use of parallel computing to maintain tractability. While extensive work has examined sample-splitting strategies in settings where the number of observations $n$ greatly exceeds the number of features $p$, the equally important (ultra) high-dimensional regime ($p &gt;&gt; n$) has been comparatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a feature-splitting proximal point algorithm, FS-QRPPA, for penalized QR in high-dimensional regime. Leveraging recent developments in variational analysis, we establish a Q-linear convergence rate for FS-QRPPA and demonstrate its superior scalability in large-scale genomic applications from the UK Biobank relative to existing methods. Moreover, FS-QRPPA yields more accurate coefficient estimates and better coverage for prediction intervals than current approaches. We provide a parallel implementation in the R package fsQRPPA, making penalized QR tractable on large-scale datasets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian score calibration for approximate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05357v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientists continue to develop increasingly complex mechanistic models to reflect their knowledge more realistically. Statistical inference using these models can be challenging since the corresponding likelihood function is often intractable and model simulation may be computationally burdensome. Fortunately, in many of these situations it is possible to adopt a surrogate model or approximate likelihood function. It may be convenient to conduct Bayesian inference directly with a surrogate, but this can result in a posterior with poor uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a new method for adjusting approximate posterior samples to reduce bias and improve posterior coverage properties. We do this by optimizing a transformation of the approximate posterior, the result of which maximizes a scoring rule. Our approach requires only a (fixed) small number of complex model simulations and is numerically stable. We develop supporting theory for our method and demonstrate beneficial corrections to approximate posteriors across several examples of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Inference for Generalized Linear Mixed Models via Stochastic Gradient MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is widely used for analyzing correlated data, particularly in large-scale biomedical and social science applications. Scalable Bayesian inference for GLMMs is challenging because the marginal likelihood is intractable and conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods become computationally prohibitive as the number of subjects grows. We develop a stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithm tailored to GLMMs that enables accurate posterior inference in the large-sample regime. Our approach uses Fisher's identity to construct an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient of the marginal log-likelihood, making SGMCMC feasible when direct gradient computation is impossible. We analyze the additional variability introduced by both minibatching and gradient approximation, and derive a post-hoc covariance correction that yields properly calibrated posterior uncertainty. Through simulations, we show that the proposed method provides accurate posterior means and variances, outperforming existing approaches, including control variate methods, in large-$n$ settings. We further demonstrate the method's practical utility in an analysis of electronic health records data, where accounting for variance inflation materially changes scientific conclusions.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric fiducial inference for Cox models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: R. A. Fisher introduced the concept of fiducial as a potential replacement for the Bayesian posterior distribution in the 1930s. During the past century, fiducial approaches have been explored in various parametric and nonparametric settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no fiducial inference has been developed in the realm of semiparametric statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel fiducial approach for semiparametric models. To streamline our presentation, we use the Cox proportional hazards model, which is the most popular model for the analysis of survival data, as a running example. Other models and extensions are also discussed. In our experiments, we find our method to perform well especially in situations when the maximum likelihood estimator fails.</description>

      <title>Network topology of the Euro Area interbank market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing availability of large amounts of granular financial data, paired with the advances of big data related technologies induces the need of suitable analytics that can represent and extract meaningful information from such data. In this paper we propose a multi-layer network approach to distill the Euro Area (EA) banking system in different distinct layers. Each layer of the network represents a specific type of financial relationship between banks, based on various sources of EA granular data collections. The resulting multi-layer network allows one to describe, analyze and compare the topology and structure of EA banks from different perspectives, eventually yielding a more complete picture of the financial market. This granular information representation has the potential to enable researchers and practitioners to better apprehend financial system dynamics as well as to support financial policies to manage and monitor financial risk from a more holistic point of view.</description>

      <title>Exact inference via quasi-conjugacy in two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonparametric model for time-evolving, unobserved probability distributions from discrete-time data consisting of unlabelled partitions. The latent process is a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet diffusion, and observations arise via exchangeable sampling. Applications include social and genetic data where only aggregate clustering summaries are observed. To address the intractable likelihood, we develop a tractable inferential framework that avoids label enumeration and direct simulation of the latent state. We exploit a duality between the diffusion and a pure-death process on partitions, together with coagulation operators that encode the effect of new data. These yield closed-form, recursive updates for forward and backward inference. We compute exact posterior distributions of the latent state at arbitrary times and predictive distributions of future or interpolated partitions. This enables online and offline inference and forecasting with full uncertainty quantification, bypassing MCMC and sequential Monte Carlo. Compared to particle filtering, our method achieves higher accuracy, lower variance, and substantial computational gains. We illustrate the methodology with synthetic experiments and a social network application, recovering interpretable patterns in time-varying heterozygosity.</description>
