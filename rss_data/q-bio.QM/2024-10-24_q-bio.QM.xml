      <title>Self-supervised inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning for detecting atrial fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered clinical arrhythmia associated with stroke and increased mortality. Since professional medical knowledge is required for annotation, exploiting a large corpus of ECGs to develop accurate supervised learning-based atrial fibrillation algorithms remains challenging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising recipe for generalized ECG representation learning, eliminating the dependence on expensive labeling. However, without well-designed incorporations of knowledge related to atrial fibrillation, existing SSL approaches typically suffer from unsatisfactory capture of robust ECG representations. In this paper, we propose an inter-intra period-aware ECG representation learning approach. Considering ECGs of atrial fibrillation patients exhibit the irregularity in RR intervals and the absence of P-waves, we develop specific pre-training tasks for interperiod and intraperiod representations, aiming to learn the single-period stable morphology representation while retaining crucial interperiod features. After further fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable AUC performances on the BTCH dataset, \textit{i.e.}, 0.953/0.996 for paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation detection. On commonly used benchmarks of CinC2017 and CPSC2021, the generalization capability and effectiveness of our methodology are substantiated with competitive results.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Genetic Basis of Glioblastoma Heterogeneity through Multimodal Analysis of Whole Slide Images and RNA Sequencing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer characterized by rapid progression and poor prognosis. Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</description>

      <title>Omics-driven hybrid dynamic modeling of bioprocesses with uncertainty estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an omics-driven modeling pipeline that integrates machine-learning tools to facilitate the dynamic modeling of multiscale biological systems. Random forests and permutation feature importance are proposed to mine omics datasets, guiding feature selection and dimensionality reduction for dynamic modeling. Continuous and differentiable machine-learning functions can be trained to link the reduced omics feature set to key components of the dynamic model, resulting in a hybrid model. As proof of concept, we apply this framework to a high-dimensional proteomics dataset of $\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}$. After identifying key intracellular proteins that correlate with cell growth, targeted dynamic experiments are designed, and key model parameters are captured as functions of the selected proteins using Gaussian processes. This approach captures the dynamic behavior of yeast strains under varying proteome profiles while estimating the uncertainty in the hybrid model's predictions. The outlined modeling framework is adaptable to other scenarios, such as integrating additional layers of omics data for more advanced multiscale biological systems, or employing alternative machine-learning methods to handle larger datasets. Overall, this study outlines a strategy for leveraging omics data to inform multiscale dynamic modeling in systems biology and bioprocess engineering.</description>

      <title>OWPCP: A Deep Learning Model to Predict Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of chemical compounds have great importance in several areas, including pharmaceuticals, environmental and separation science. Among these are physicochemical properties such as the octanol-water partition coefficient, which has been considered an important index pointing out lipophilicity and hydrophilicity. It affects drug absorption and membrane permeability. Following Lipinski's rule of five, logP was identified as one of the key determinants of the stability of chemical entities and, as such, needed state-of-the-art methods for measuring lipophilicity. This paper presents a deep-learning model, OWPCP, developed to compute logP using Morgan fingerprints and MACCS keys as input features. It uses the interconnection of such molecular representations with logP values extracted from 26,254 compounds. The dataset was prepared to contain a wide range of chemical structures with differing molecular weights and polar surface area. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using the Keras Tuner alongside the Hyperband algorithm to enhance the performance. OWPCP demonstrated outstanding performance compared to current computational methods, achieving an MAE=0.247 on the test set and outperforming all previous DL models. Remarkably, while one of the most accurate recent models is based on experimental data on retention time to make predictions, OWPCP manages computing logP efficiently without depending on these factors, being, therefore, very useful during early-stage drug discovery. Our model outperforms the best model, which leverages Retention Time, and our model does not require any experimental data. Further validation of the model performance was done across different functional groups, and it showed very high accuracy, especially for compounds that contain aliphatic OH groups. The results have indicated that OWPCP provides a reliable prediction of logP.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Infer Cell Pseudotime,Velocity Field and Gene Interaction from Multi-Branch scRNA-seq Data with scPN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling cellular dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is critical for understanding cell development and underlying gene regulatory relationships. Many current methods rely on single-cell velocity to obtain pseudotime, which can lead to inconsistencies between pseudotime and velocity. It is challenging to simultaneously infer cell pseudotime and gene interaction networks, especially in multi-branch differentiation scenarios. We present single-cell Piecewise Network (scPN), a novel high-dimensional dynamical modeling approach that iteratively extracts temporal patterns and inter-gene relationships from scRNA-seq data. To tackle multi-branch differentiation challenges, scPN models gene regulatory dynamics using piecewise gene-gene interaction networks, offering an interpretable framework for deciphering complex gene regulation patterns over time. Results on synthetic data and multiple scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the superior performance of scPN in reconstructing cellular dynamics and identifying key transcription factors involved in development compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, scPN is the first attempt at modeling that can recover pseudotime, velocity fields, and gene interactions all at once on multi-branch datasets.</description>

      <title>smICA: an open source repository for mapping the concentration of fluorescently labeled molecules in living cells on the basis of confocal imaging combined with time-correlated single-photon counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced microscopy techniques are essential for visualizing and tracking cellular components and molecules in biomedical research. However, conventional fluorescence microscopy methods often struggle with accurately measuring molecule concentrations in cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates laser scanning confocal microscopy with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), supported by an open-source analysis tool called smICA (single-molecule Image to Concentration Analyzer). Our method, validated against traditional fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), offers enhanced accuracy in determining fluorescent molecule concentrations, particularly in cases where molecules are immobile or unevenly distributed. This is demonstrated using fluorescently labeled mRNA in living cells, highlighting the approach's effectiveness.</description>
