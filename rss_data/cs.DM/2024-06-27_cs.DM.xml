      <title>Staff Scheduling for Demand-Responsive Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staff scheduling is a well-known problem in operations research and finds its application at hospitals, airports, supermarkets, and many others. Its goal is to assign shifts to staff members such that a certain objective function, e.g. revenue, is maximized. Meanwhile, various constraints of the staff members and the organization need to be satisfied. Typically in staff scheduling problems, there are hard constraints on the minimum number of employees that should be available at specific points of time. Often multiple hard constraints guaranteeing the availability of specific number of employees with different roles need to be considered. Staff scheduling for demand-responsive services, such as, e.g., ride-pooling and ride-hailing services, differs in a key way from this: There are often no hard constraints on the minimum number of employees needed at fixed points in time. Rather, the number of employees working at different points in time should vary according to the demand at those points in time. Having too few employees at a point in time results in lost revenue, while having too many employees at a point in time results in not having enough employees at other points in time, since the total personnel-hours are limited. The objective is to maximize the total reward generated over a planning horizon, given a monotonic relationship between the number of shifts active at a point in time and the instantaneous reward generated at that point in time. This key difference makes it difficult to use existing staff scheduling algorithms for planning shifts in demand-responsive services. In this article, we present a novel approach for modelling and solving staff scheduling problems for demand-responsive services that optimizes for the relevant reward function.</description>

      <title>Cuts in Graphs with Matroid Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\sc Vertex $(s, t)$-Cut} and {\sc Vertex Multiway Cut} are two fundamental graph separation problems in algorithmic graph theory. We study matroidal generalizations of these problems, where in addition to the usual input, we are given a representation $R \in \mathbb{F}^{r \times n}$ of a linear matroid $\mathcal{M} = (V(G), \mathcal{I})$ of rank $r$ in the input, and the goal is to determine whether there exists a vertex subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ that has the required cut properties, as well as is independent in the matroid $\mathcal{M}$. We refer to these problems as {\sc Independent Vertex $(s, t)$-cut}, and {\sc Independent Multiway Cut}, respectively. We show that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable ({\sf FPT}) when parameterized by the solution size (which can be assumed to be equal to the rank of the matroid $\mathcal{M}$). These results are obtained by exploiting the recent technique of flow augmentation [Kim et al.~STOC '22], combined with a dynamic programming algorithm on flow-paths \'a la [Feige and Mahdian,~STOC '06] that maintains a representative family of solutions w.r.t.~the given matroid [Marx, TCS '06; Fomin et al., JACM]. As a corollary, we also obtain {\sf FPT} algorithms for the independent version of {\sc Odd Cycle Transversal}. Further, our results can be generalized to other variants of the problems, e.g., weighted versions, or edge-deletion versions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Cuts and Grothendieck Covers: a Primal-Dual Approximation Framework Extending the Goemans--Williamson Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a primal-dual framework for randomized approximation algorithms utilizing semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. Our framework pairs a continuum of APX-complete problems including MaxCut, Max2Sat, MaxDicut, and more generally, Max-Boolean Constraint Satisfaction and MaxQ (maximization of a positive semidefinite quadratic form over the hypercube) with new APX-complete problems which are stated as convex optimization problems with exponentially many variables. These new dual counterparts, based on what we call Grothendieck covers, range from fractional cut covering problems (for MaxCut) to tensor sign covering problems (for MaxQ). For each of these problem pairs, our framework transforms the randomized approximation algorithms with the best known approximation factors for the primal problems to randomized approximation algorithms for their dual counterparts with reciprocal approximation factors which are tight with respect to the Unique Games Conjecture. For each APX-complete pair, our algorithms solve a single SDP relaxation and generate feasible solutions for both problems which also provide approximate optimality certificates for each other. Our work utilizes techniques from areas of randomized approximation algorithms, convex optimization, spectral sparsification, as well as Chernoff-type concentration results for random matrices.</description>

      <title>Network Representation and Modular Decomposition of Combinatorial Structures: A Galled-Tree Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phylogenetics, reconstructing rooted trees from distances between taxa is a common task. B\"ocker and Dress generalized this concept by introducing symbolic dated maps $\delta:X \times X \to \Upsilon$, where distances are replaced by symbols, and showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between symbolic ultrametrics and labeled rooted phylogenetic trees. Many combinatorial structures fall under the umbrella of symbolic dated maps, such as 2-dissimilarities, symmetric labeled 2-structures, or edge-colored complete graphs, and are here referred to as strudigrams. Strudigrams have a unique decomposition into non-overlapping modules, which can be represented by a modular decomposition tree (MDT). In the absence of prime modules, strudigrams are equivalent to symbolic ultrametrics, and the MDT fully captures the relationships $\delta(x,y)$ between pairs of vertices $x,y$ in $X$ through the label of their least common ancestor in the MDT. However, in the presence of prime vertices, this information is generally hidden. To provide this missing structural information, we aim to locally replace the prime vertices in the MDT to obtain networks that capture full information about the strudigrams. While starting with the general framework of prime-vertex replacement networks, we then focus on a specific type of such networks obtained by replacing prime vertices with so-called galls, resulting in labeled galled-trees. We introduce the concept of galled-tree explainable (GATEX) strudigrams, provide their characterization, and demonstrate that recognizing these structures and reconstructing the labeled networks that explain them can be achieved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Learning to Remove Cuts in Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting plane methods are a fundamental approach for solving integer linear programs (ILPs). In each iteration of such methods, additional linear constraints (cuts) are introduced to the constraint set with the aim of excluding the previous fractional optimal solution while not affecting the optimal integer solution. In this work, we explore a novel approach within cutting plane methods: instead of only adding new cuts, we also consider the removal of previous cuts introduced at any of the preceding iterations of the method under a learnable parametric criteria. We demonstrate that in fundamental combinatorial optimization settings such cut removal policies can lead to significant improvements over both human-based and machine learning-guided cut addition policies even when implemented with simple models.</description>

      <title>Crossing Number is NP-hard for Constant Path-width (and Tree-width)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossing Number is a celebrated problem in graph drawing. It is known to be NP-complete since 1980s, and fairly involved techniques were already required to show its fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the vertex cover number. In this paper we prove that computing exactly the crossing number is NP-hard even for graphs of path-width 12 (and as a result, even of tree-width 9). Thus, while tree-width and path-width have been very successful tools in many graph algorithm scenarios, our result shows that general crossing number computations unlikely (under P!=NP) could be successfully tackled using bounded width of graph decompositions, which has been a 'tantalizing open problem' [S. Cabello, Hardness of Approximation for Crossing Number, 2013] till now.</description>

      <title>Exact Minimum Weight Spanners via Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a weighted graph $G$, a minimum weight $\alpha$-spanner is a least-weight subgraph $H\subseteq G$ that preserves minimum distances between all node pairs up to a factor of $\alpha$. There are many results on heuristics and approximation algorithms, including a recent investigation of their practical performance [20]. Exact approaches, in contrast, have long been denounced as impractical: The first exact ILP (integer linear program) method [48] from 2004 is based on a model with exponentially many path variables, solved via column generation. A second approach [2], modeling via arc-based multicommodity flow, was presented in 2019. In both cases, only graphs with 40-100 nodes were reported to be solvable.
  In this paper, we briefly report on a theoretical comparison between these two models from a polyhedral point of view, and then concentrate on improvements and engineering aspects. We evaluate their performance in a large-scale empirical study. We report that our tuned column generation approach, based on multicriteria shortest path computations, is able to solve instances with over 16000 nodes within 13 minutes. Furthermore, now knowing optimal solutions for larger graphs, we are able to investigate the quality of the strongest known heuristic on reasonably sized instances for the first time.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=|a\Delta b|/|a\cup b|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$. In addition, we show that a much smaller subset of $2^X$ suffices to resolve, with high probability, all different pairs of subsets of $X$ of cardinality at most $\sqrt{|X|}/\ln|X|$, up to a factor.</description>

      <title>Structural and Combinatorial Properties of 2-swap Word Permutation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the graph induced by the $\textit{2-swap}$ permutation on words with a fixed Parikh vector. A $2$-swap is defined as a pair of positions $s = (i, j)$ where the word $w$ induced by the swap $s$ on $v$ is $v[1] v[2] \dots v[i - 1] v[j] v[i+1] \dots v[j - 1] v[i] v[j + 1] \dots v[n]$. With these permutations, we define the $\textit{Configuration Graph}$, $G(P)$ defined over a given Parikh vector. Each vertex in $G(P)$ corresponds to a unique word with the Parikh vector $P$, with an edge between any pair of words $v$ and $w$ if there exists a swap $s$ such that $v \circ s = w$. We provide several key combinatorial properties of this graph, including the exact diameter of this graph, the clique number of the graph, and the relationships between subgraphs within this graph. Additionally, we show that for every vertex in the graph, there exists a Hamiltonian path starting at this vertex. Finally, we provide an algorithm enumerating these paths from a given input word of length $n$ with a delay of at most $O(\log n)$ between outputting edges, requiring $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>
