      <title>On extended Frobenius structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result in quantum topology is that oriented 2-dimensional topological quantum field theories (2-TQFTs) are fully classified by commutative Frobenius algebras. In 2006, Turaev and Turner introduced additional structure on Frobenius algebras, forming what are called extended Frobenius algebras, to classify 2-TQFTs in the unoriented case. This work provides a systematic study of extended Frobenius algebras in various settings: over a field, in a monoidal category, and in the framework of monoidal functors. Numerous examples, classification results, and general constructions of extended Frobenius algebras are established.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, II: Witt Equivalence and Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can two strongly rational vertex operator algebras or 1+1d rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) be related by topological manipulations? For vertex operator algebras, the term "topological manipulations" refers to operations like passing to a conformal extension or restricting to a conformal subalgebra; for RCFTs, topological manipulations include operations like gauging (or orbifolding) a finite subpart of a generalized global symmetry or interpolating to a new theory via a topological line interface of finite quantum dimension.
  Inspired by results in the theory of even lattices, and also the theory of tensor categories, we say that two strongly rational vertex operator algebras are Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their representation categories are Witt equivalent as modular tensor categories. Two RCFTs are said to be Witt equivalent if their central charges agree and if their associated 2+1d topological field theories can be separated by a topological surface. We argue that Witt equivalence is necessary for two theories to be related by topological manipulations. We conjecture that it is also sufficient, and give proofs in various special cases.
  We relate this circle of ideas to the problem of classifying RCFTs, and to lore concerning deformation classes of quantum field theories. We use the notion of Witt equivalence to argue, assuming the conjectural classification of unitary, $c=1$ RCFTs, that all of the finite global symmetries of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model are invertible. Finally, we sketch a "quantum Galois theory" for chiral CFTs, which generalizes prior mathematical literature by incorporating non-invertible symmetries; we illustrate this non-invertible Galois theory in the context of the monster CFT, for which we produce a Fibonacci symmetry.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and the shadow world: quantum $6j$-symbols for Verma modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of invariants of links associated to infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ using graphical representation for quantum $6j$-symbols, the shadow world. We obtain formulae for $q3j$-symbols and $q6j$-symbols for Verma modules and study their properties. This hints at the structure of the possible target category for Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for such an invariant.</description>

      <title>Module categories of the generic Virasoro VOA and quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between two braided tensor categories. On the one hand, we consider the category of modules of the Virasoro vertex operator algebra with a generic central charge (generic Virasoro VOA) generated by those simple modules lying in the first row of the Kac table. On the other hand, we take the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ with $q$ determined by the central charge. This is a continuation of our previous work in which we examined intertwining operators for the generic Virasoro VOA in detail. Our strategy to show the categorical equivalence is to take those results as input and directly compare the structures of the tensor categories. Therefore, we are to execute the most elementary proof of categorical equivalence. We also study the category of $C_{1}$-cofinite modules of the generic Virasoro VOA. We show that it is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional type I modules of $\mathcal{U}_{q} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})\otimes \mathcal{U}_{\tilde{q}} (\mathfrak{sl}_{2})$ as a tensor category, where $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ are again related to the central charge.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for 2+1D topological phases derived from crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an exactly solvable model for 2+1D topological phases of matter on a triangulated surface derived from a crossed module of semisimple finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, the `Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model'. This model generalizes both the Kitaev quantum double model for a semisimple Hopf algebra and the full higher Kitaev model derived from a 2-group, and can hence be interpreted as a Hopf-algebraic discrete higher gauge theory.
  We construct a family of crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, $(\mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(X) \otimes \mathbb{C}E \xrightarrow{\partial} \mathscr{F}_{\mathbb{C}}(Y) \rtimes \mathbb{C} G, \triangleright)$, that depends on four finite groups, $E,G,X$ and $Y$. We calculate the ground-state spaces of the resulting model on a triangulated surface when $G=E=\{1\}$ and when $Y=\{1\}$, prove that those ground-state spaces are canonically independent of the triangulations, and so depend only on the underlying surface; and moreover we find a 2+1D TQFT whose state spaces on surfaces give the ground-state spaces. These TQFTs are particular cases of Quinn's finite total homotopy TQFT and hence the state spaces assigned to surfaces are free vector spaces on sets of homotopy classes of maps from a surface to homotopy finite spaces, in this case obtained as classifying spaces of finite groupoids and finite crossed modules of groupoids.
  We leave it as an open problem whether the ground-state space of the Hopf-algebraic higher Kitaev model on a triangulated surface is independent of the triangulation for general crossed modules of semisimple Hopf algebras, whether a TQFT always exists whose state space on a surface gives the ground-state space of the model, and whether the ground-state space of the model obtained from $E,G,X,Y$ can always be given a homotopical explanation.</description>

      <title>Self-distributive structures in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an important feature of our existing physical theories that observables generate one-parameter groups of transformations. In classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, this is due to the fact that the observables form a Lie algebra, and it manifests itself in Noether's theorem. In this paper, we introduce Lie quandles as the minimal mathematical structure needed to express the idea that observables generate transformations. This is based on the notion of a quandle used most famously in knot theory, whose main defining property is the self-distributivity equation $x \triangleright (y \triangleright z) = (x \triangleright y) \triangleright (x \triangleright z)$. We argue that Lie quandles can be thought of as nonlinear generalizations of Lie algebras.
  We also observe that taking convex combinations of points in vector spaces, which physically corresponds to mixing states, satisfies the same form of self-distributivity.</description>
