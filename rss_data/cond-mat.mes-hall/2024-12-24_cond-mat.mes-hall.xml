      <title>Broadband Magnomechanics Enabled by Magnon-Spoof Plasmon Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics is one important hybrid magnonic platform that focuses on the coherent interaction between magnons and phonons. The resulting magnon polarons inherit the intrinsic properties of both magnons and phonons, combining their individual advantages and enabling new physics and functionalities. But in previous demonstrations the magnon-phonon coupling either have limited bandwidth or cannot be efficiently accessed. In this work, we show that by utilizing the slow-wave hybrid magnonics configuration based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs), the coherent magnon-phonon interaction can be efficiently observed over a frequency range larger than 7 GHz on a YIG thin film device. In particular, the capability of the SSPPs in exciting short-wavelength magnons reveals a novel size effect when the magnons are coupled with high-over tone bulk acoustic resonances. Our work paves the way towards novel magnomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Coherent Bunching of Anyons and their Dissociation in Interference Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference in fractional quantum Hall states generally reveals the fractional charge $e^*$ of their elementary quasiparticles. Indeed, flux periods of ${\Delta}{\Phi}=(e/e^*){\Phi}_0$ were observed in interference of particle-like fractional states. Here, we report interference measurements of particle-hole conjugated states at filling factors ${\nu}=2/3, 3/5, 4/7,$ revealing the unexpected periodicities, ${\Delta}{\Phi}={\Phi}_0/{\nu}$. Moreover, the measured shot noise Fano factor (F) of partitioned quasiparticles in the interferometers quantum point contacts (QPCs) was $F={\nu}$ and not the expected $F=e^*/e$. These combined observations indicate that fractional quasiparticles tunnel in the QPCs and interfere as coherently bunched pairs, triples, and quadruplets, respectively. Charging a small metallic gate in the center of the two-path interferometer forms an antidot (or a dot) and introduces local quasiparticles, leading, unexpectedly, to a dissociation of the bunched quasiparticles, thus restoring the flux periodicity set by the elementary quasiparticle charge. The surprising observations of bunching and dissociation, unsupported by current theory, suggest similar effects in particle-like states at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Light-enhanced dipolar interactions between exciton polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. We show that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. Furthermore, we show that this light enhancement is sensitive to the dipole moment and is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions. Our results reveal the role of dark exciton states in dipolariton interactions as well as the optimal bilayer properties for achieving strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effects in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. We show the linearly (circularly) polarized light can generate injection (shift) current in the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction when the N\'{e}el vector points in an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current does not depend\ on the frequency $% \omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $% \varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}\leq \hbar \omega \leq \hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Driven Electron Transport through Fano-Anderson Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Excitons under large pseudomagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) acquire a spin-like quantum number, a pseudospin, originating from the crystal's discrete rotational symmetry. Here, we break this symmetry using a tunable uniaxial strain, effectively generating a pseudomagnetic field exceeding 40 Tesla. Under this large field, we demonstrate pseudospin analogs of spintronic phenomena such as the Zeeman effect and Larmor precession. Moreover, we determine previously inaccessible fundamental properties of TMDs, including the strength of the depolarizing field responsible for the loss of exciton coherence. Finally, we uncover the bosonic -- as opposed to fermionic -- nature of many-body excitonic species using the pseudomagnetic equivalent of the $g$-factor spectroscopy. Our work is the first step toward establishing this spectroscopy as a universal method for probing correlated many-body states and realizing pseudospin analogs of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quasicrystalline topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and band topology is expected to uncover numerous novel physical phenomena. However, the majority of research has focused on periodic crystalline structures, with comparatively fewer studies exploring quasicrystalline systems. In this paper, we delve into the influence of asymmetric hopping on the topological insulators, specifically focusing on quantum spin Hall insulators and higher-order topological insulators in an octagonal Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. We demonstrate that asymmetric hopping can significantly alter the distribution of edge states, leading to a uniform distribution across all boundaries or localizing them at a single edge, depending on the symmetry adjustments. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of higher-order topological corner states under perturbations, showing that these states can maintain their distribution even in the presence of non-Hermiticity. Our findings not only expand the current understanding of topological states in quasicrystals under non-Hermitian conditions, but also provide valuable theoretical guidance for manipulating corner state distributions in non-Hermitian quasicrystalline higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16734v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</description>

      <title>Modal coupling impacts the parametric normal mode splitting: Quantifying the tunable mode coupling of a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of the modal coupling strength between two hybridized normal modes or oscillators remains a hard task to achieve. However, the coupling effects can be unearthed by observing the system's dynamic behaviour upon energy injection. One of the manifestations of this approach is the normal mode splitting generated using parametric excitation. In this contribution, a rigorous and generic mathematical formulation for the parametric normal mode splitting in any two-mode dynamical system is presented. It allows for estimating the coupling strength both in the weak and in the strong coupling regime, and irrespective of the degree of hybridization between the modes. The method is applied on the vibrations of a nanomechanical two-mode system implemented in a tunable nanostring resonator. We find good agreement between the experiment and the theoretical model, and are able to quantify the modal coupling of the nanostring as a function of the applied bias voltage.</description>

      <title>Instanton-Induced Supersymmetry Breaking in Topological Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Topological transport in monolayer jacutingaite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer-jacutingaite (Pt2HgSe3) has been predicted to be the first large-gap Kane-Mele quantum spin Hall insulator. Materials in the jacutingaite family undergo topological phase transitions (TPTs), i.e., from a topologically non-trivial to a semimetallic phase and further to the normal insulating phase when exposed to electric fields and off-resonance, high-frequency and high-intensity laser irradiation. In this article, we investigate the rich tapestry of topological phases in this unique material in the presence of an appropriate choice of off-resonance circularly polarized laser fields and staggered sublattice potentials. The interplay of these stimuli with large spin-orbit coupling, due to the buckled structure of jacutingaite materials, results in the emergence of quantum spin Hall insulator, valley-spin-polarized metal, spin-polarized metal, photo-induced quantum Hall insulator, anomalous quantum Hall insulator and band insulator phases. By analyzing the band structures, we compute Berry curvatures in different topological regimes for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. Furthermore, by using the Kubo formula, we calculate the spin-valley resolved longitudinal and Hall conductivities as a function of photon energies showing that the conductivities exhibit a strong topological state dependence. The photon energy of the intraband and interband optical transitions can be tuned by varying the electric and optical fields. Finally, we demonstrate that by modulating the chemical potential, some of the allowed optical transitions become Pauli blocked due to the optical selection rules</description>

      <title>Controlling encirclement of an exceptional point using coupled spintronic nano-oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), branch singularities parameter space of non-Hermitian eigenvalue manifolds, display unique topological phenomena linked to eigenvalue and eigenvector switching: the parameter space states are highly sensitive to the system's parameter changes. Therefore, we suggest investigating the parameter space in the presence of an EP by experimentally accessing and exploiting the topological nature of the coupled system around an EP. We demonstrate control over exceptional points in coupled vortex spin-transfer torque oscillators by adjusting the system's damping through the spin-transfer torque effect and their relative phase. This approach allows for precise manipulation of the coupling behavior in the vicinity of an exceptional point. We report the presence of both level attraction/repulsion by adjusting the system's parameters. Moreover, we evidence the topological nature of the EP by dynamically encircling it in the phase-current parameter space, leading to a switch of the eigenstates. Our study introduces a new method for exploring non-Hermitian physics in spintronic systems at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Electron-Magnon Interaction-Induced Topological Phase Transition in Magnetic Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous interest raised by the recent realization of magnetic Weyl semimetals and the observation of giant anomalous Hall signals, most of the theories used to interpret experimental data overlook the magnetic fluctuations, which are ubiquitous in such materials and can massively impact topological and transport properties. In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.</description>

      <title>Reduced Wannier Representation for Topological Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a procedure for constructing a maximally localized Wannier basis for a subspace of bands with a non-zero Chern number. Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we analyze the limits of using the projection procedure to obtain a Wannierizable subspace from a set of topologically obstructed bands. The Wannier functions from this subspace form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. We consider the Haldane tight-binding model in the Chern phase as the platform for our investigation.</description>

      <title>Subband structure of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire: transition from normal type to inverted type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the $6\times6$ Kane model in the spherical approximation, both the electron and the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire are calculated using analytical method. The transcendental equations determining the subband energies in the nanowire are analytically derived by utilizing both the total angular momentum conservation and the hard wall boundary condition. We show there exists topological band transition in the HgTe nanowire, very similar to that demonstrated in a HgTe quantum well. Via tuning the radius of the nanowire, we find there is a gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure. When the radius is larger than the critical radius $R_{\rm c}\approx3.2185$ nm, the HgTe nanowire is in the inverted regime.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically chiral exciton polaritons in an atomically-thin semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation by acousto-electric evanescent wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that a spin current can be induced by the acousto-electric evanescent wave, an electric field associated with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) that decay along the surface normal. A previous study showed that a magnetic-field-dependent dc voltage (acoustic voltage) emerges in heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnet (FM) bilayers under excitation of SAWs. The effect, referred to as the acoustic spin Hall effect, was understood by assuming a SAW-induced ac spin current rectified by the oscillation of the FM layer magnetization and the inverse spin Hall effect. However, the mechanism of the spin current generation remained unidentified. Here we measure the acoustic voltage as a function of the SAW propagation direction relative to the crystalline orientation of a LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We find that the magnetic field angle dependence of the acoustic voltage exhibits a phase shift depending on the SAW propagation direction. The result is consistently explained in terms of the acousto-electric evanescent wave generating the spin current in HM layer via the spin Hall effect, thus clarifies the origin of the acoustic spin Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Influence of Magnetic Field and Temperature on Half Width at Half Maximum of Multi-photon Absorption Spectrum in Two-dimensional Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Profile numerical method to calculate the spectral line width, or half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the absorption peaks of multi-photon absorption processes in a two-dimensional graphene system (2DGS) according to important external parameters such as magnetic field and temperature in the presence of strong electromagnetic waves (SEMW). The appearance of these absorption peaks is theoretically obtained from magneto-phonon resonance conditions within the framework of the quantum kinetic equation. The results take into account both scattering mechanisms: electron-optical phonon and electron-acoustic phonon. Under the influence of the magnetic field, according to the increasing photon energy of the SEMW, the graph showing the dependence of the multi-photon nonlinear absorption coefficient on photon energy has the form of absorption spectrum lines following magneto-phonon resonance conditions. When increasing the value of the external magnetic field and the intensity of the SEMW, the intensity of the resonance peaks increases. In addition, the HWHM W of the resonance peaks of multi-photon absorption processes increases with increasing magnetic field $\mathrm{B}$ according to the square root law $\mathrm{W} = \kappa\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}$ but is independent of temperature. The value of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process is larger than the value of the HWHM of the multi-photon absorption processes. The calculations of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process in this paper are consistent with previous experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Thus, our calculations of the HWHM of multi-photon absorption processes can serve as reliable predictions for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of the effect of increasing weak electromagnetic wave by a strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic expressions for the absorption coefficient (AC) of a weak electromagnetic wave (EMW) in 2D Graphene under influence of strong laser radiation are calculated using the quantum kinetic equation (QKE) in the case of electron-optical phonon scattering in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The dependence of the AC on the intensity $E_{02}$ and the frequency $\Omega_2$ of a weak EMW, on the intensity $E_{01}$ and the frequency $\Omega_1$ of a strong laser radiation, on the temperature T of the system is obtained. These results are investigated from low temperature to high temperature. These results are obtained from the QKE method, which broke the limit of the Boltzmann kinetic equations (only investigated in the high-temperature domain). Besides, the numerical results show that the AC of a weak EMW in 2D Graphene can have negative values. This demonstrates the possibility of increasing weak EMW by strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene. This is different from a similar problem in bulk semiconductors and the case without strong laser radiation. In the case of the presence of an external magnetic field, the numerical calculation results also show the appearance of the peak spectral lines that obey the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. The appearance of these resonance peaks provides a model illustrating the dependence of the Half-Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) on the external magnetic field. This is an important criterion for the fabrication of graphene-related electronic components and orientation for future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of the non-concentric spherical core-shell quantum dot under the influence of an externally applied electric field was proposed. It was established that the energy spectrum of both the electron and the hole depends on the intensity of the electric field as well as on the specific location of the core within the quantum dot. The phenomenon of energy level splitting and degeneration was analyzed in detail. Additionally, the variations in the optical gap were determined and expressed as a function of the applied electric field strength and the position of the core in the quantum dot.</description>

      <title>First-Principles' Derived Force Field for hBN Nanostrucrtures; Applications to Monolayers, Nanotubes and Nanotori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. An analytical expression has been provided for the dependence of the bending rigidity of relatively large diameter hBN nanotubes on their radius.</description>

      <title>AFM Cantilever Magnetometry for Measuring Femto-Nm Torques Generated by Single Magnetic Particles for Cell Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6$\pm$0.6$\cdot$10$^{-15}$ Nm torque while applying 373$\pm$5 mT field at 12$\pm$2 degrees to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 $\mu$m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a $\approx$ 1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high PMA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic vortices and skyrmions are typically characterized by distinct topological invariants. This work presents a unified approach for the topological classification of these textures, encompassing isolated objects and configurations where skyrmions and vortices coexist. Using homotopy group analysis, we derive topological invariants that form the free abelian group, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. We provide an explicit method for calculating the corresponding integer indices in continuous and discrete systems. This unified classification framework extends beyond magnetism and is applicable to physical systems in general.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of Bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ Lattice Induced by Polarized Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the topological properties of the photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, focusing on both aligned and cyclic stacking configurations under the influence of off-resonant circularly polarized light. We derive precise analytical expressions for the quasi-energy bands in the aligned stacking case, while numerical results for cyclic stacking are obtained at the Dirac points. Our findings reveal that the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by circularly polarized light completely lifts the degeneracy at the $t^{a,c}$-point intersections at these Dirac points. To investigate the topological signatures of the driven $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, we examine the Berry phase through anomalous magnetic and thermal responses. Notably, at $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, we find that the orbital magnetic moments associated with both corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, along with their Berry curvatures. For values of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, off-resonant light induces deformations in the bands near the Dirac points, leading to two equally sized gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum. The position of the chemical potential within these gaps significantly influences the orbital magnetization. We observe that linear variations in magnetization correlate with Chern numbers on either side of $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$. These topological features manifest as distinct quantized values of anomalous Hall conductivity across both stacking types...</description>

      <title>Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has recently been demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting electronics, which features an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, compared to the conventional thermally-growth SiO2. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs) featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.</description>

      <title>Topological dipoles of quantum skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are spatially localized whirls of spin moments in two dimension, featuring a nontrivial topological charge and a well-defined topological charge density. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of magnetic skyrmions is governed by a dipole conservation law associated with the topological charge, akin to that in fracton theories of excitations with constrained mobility. The dipole conservation law enables a natural definition of the collective coordinate to specify the skymion's position, which ultimately leads to a greatly simplified equation of motion in the form of the Thiele equation. In this formulation, the skyrmion mass, whose existence is often debated, actually vanishes. As a result, an isolated skyrmion is intrinsically pinned to be immobile and cannot move at a constant velocity. In a spin-wave theory, we show that such dynamics corresponds to a precise cancellation between a highly nontrivial motion of the quasi-classical skyrmion spin texture and a cloud of quantum fluctuations in the form of spin waves. Given this quenched kinetic energy of quantum skyrmions, we identify close analogies to the bosonic quantum Hall problem. In particular, the topological charge density is shown to obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra that describes neutral modes of the lowest Landau level in the fractional quantum Hall problem. Consequently, the conservation of the topological dipole suggests that magnetic skyrmion materials offer a promising platform for exploring fractonic phenomena with close analogies to fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Machine-learnt potential highlights melting and freezing of aluminium nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminium nanoparticles through classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range from 200 atoms to 11000 atoms. The aluminium-aluminium interactions are modelled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behaviour at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as $3~ 10^5$ atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range of up to 2000 atoms, approximately 2 nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favours face-centred cubic (FCC) shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet's surface shows local structural order at all sizes.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Axion insulator, Weyl points, quantum anomalous Hall effect and magnetic topological phase transition in Eu3In2As4</title>

Abstract: The magnetic topological phases attract much interest, such as the axion insulator, higher-order topology, Weyl semimetals, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Here, we predict that the axion insulator phase, magnetic Weyl points, and QAHE can be achieved in Eu3In2As4. Recently, the single-crystal Eu3In2As4 has been successfully synthesized, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Our first-principles calculations show that it lies on the phase boundary between multiple magnetic topological phases, and the magnetic anisotropy is weak, with an energy difference less than 1 meV. In the AFM state, it can be tuned to an axion insulator by tensile strain. The quantized axion angle $\theta = \pi$ and the magnetic higher-order topology are characterized by the parity index $Z_4 = 2$. By applying an external magnetic field, the induced ferromagnetic (FM) state becomes an ideal magnetic topological semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points or a nodal ring. The QAHE can be achieved in FM multilayer films of Eu3In2As4 on a magnetic insulating substrate.</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier Functions and Emergent Kondo Lattices in Topological Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>High temperature antiferromagnetism in ultrathin SrRu2O6 nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized N\'eel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Carbon-based light emitting defects in different layers of hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</description>

      <title>Phase-dependent supercurrent and microwave dissipation of HgTe quantum well Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the microwave response of a HgTe quantum well Josephson junction embedded into an RF SQUID loop which is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator. The side-contacted devices studied here operate in bulk transport mode, with a separation between the superconducting contacts smaller than both the estimated carrier mean free path and superconducting coherence length. We extract the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent microwave dissipation, that, at low temperature, primarily is related to photon-induced transitions between the Andreev bound states. We study the effects of gate voltage and temperature on our devices and compare the measurements with a tight-binding model based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. A combined analysis of both microwave admittance components allows us to confirm the presence of a small gap in the Andreev bound state spectrum at phase $\pi$, indicating high interface transparency, matching our observations in DC measurements of a similar device. Our work demonstrates the versatility of microwave measurements as a tool for Josephson junction characterization and highlights the importance of the interface properties for side-contacted Josephson devices.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an anomalous non-evaporating sub-nanometre water layer in open environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water exhibits complex behaviors as a result of hydrogen bonding, and low-dimensional confined water plays a key role in material science, geology, and biology science. Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies. NV center magnetic resonance technology provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, offering non-contact atomic-scale measurements with chemical resolution capability. In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</description>

Abstract: We study the physical consequences of 't Hooft anomalies in the high-temperature limit of relativistic quantum field theories with $SU(2)$, or more generally $USp(2N)$, global symmetry. The global anomaly afflicting these symmetry groups results in new transport phenomena akin to the chiral magnetic and chiral vortical effect, predicting conductivities that are fractionally quantised in units of a half, reflecting the 2-torsion in the bordism groups $\Omega^\text{Spin}_5(BUSp(2N))\cong \mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <title>Effect of arsenic doping on structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the properties of the 2D ferromagnet CrSBr by lanthanide doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials stems from their unique properties and potential applications in spintronics, magnonics and quantum information technologies. Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out, owing to its high Curie temperature (TC ~ 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and can create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. Our main tool is the successive application of three-dimensional dualities to partially filled Landau levels of composite fermions, which imply that this theory has a complicated landscape of gapped vacua and critical points. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface for a weakly coupled composite fermion coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons theory. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description which we show matches the one expected for hierarchy states, as well as non-abelian states at even-denominator filling that arise from pair instabilities of the composite fermion's Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding spin wave (SW) damping, and how to control it to the point of being able to amplify SW-mediated signals, is one of the key requirements to bring the envisaged magnonic technologies to fruition. Even widely used magnetic insulators with low magnetization damping in their bulk, such as yttrium iron garnet, exhibit 100-fold increase in SW damping due to inevitable contact with metallic layers in magnonic circuits, as observed in very recent experiments [I. Bertelli et al., Adv. Quantum Technol. 4, 2100094 (2021)] mapping SW damping in spatially-resolved fashion. Here, we provide microscopic and rigorous understanding of wavevector-dependent SW damping using extended Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with nonlocal damping tensor, instead of conventional local scalar Gilbert damping, as derived from Schwinger-Keldysh nonequilibrium quantum field theory. In this picture, the origin of nonlocal magnetization damping and thereby induced wavevector-dependent SW damping is interaction of localized magnetic moments of magnetic insulator with conduction electrons from the examined three different types of metallic overlayers -- normal, heavy, and altermagnetic. Due to spin-split energy-momentum dispersion of conduction electrons in the latter two cases, the nonlocal damping is anisotropic in spin and space, and it can be dramatically reduced by changing the relative orientation of the two layers when compared to the usage of normal metal overlayer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. We demonstrate that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also show that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows to control the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: The checkerboard lattice is a two-dimensional non-trivial structure usually seen as a planar version of the pyrochlore lattice. This geometry supports a two-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex hopping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the topological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry curvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same as in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized. The dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is investigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused by coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the topology of open systems in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer ReAg$_2$Cl$_6$ have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave may appear in these Chern bands with $1/3$ filling. Furthermore, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class of materials such as ReAg$_2$Br$_6$, ReAu$_2$I$_6$ and ReCu$_2X_6$ ($X$=Cl, Br, I). These notable predictions in pristine 2D materials, if realized experimentally, could offer a new playground for exploring correlated topological states at elevated temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intels efforts to build a practical quantum computer are focused on developing a scalable spin-qubit platform leveraging industrial high-volume semiconductor manufacturing expertise and 300 mm fabrication infrastructure. Here, we provide an overview of the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a new customized quantum test chip, which contains 12-quantum-dot spin-qubit linear arrays, code named Tunnel Falls. These devices are fabricated using immersion and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), along with other standard high-volume manufacturing (HVM) processes, as well as production-level process control. We present key device features and fabrication details, as well as qubit characterization results confirming device functionality. These results corroborate our fabrication methods and are a crucial step towards scaling of extensible 2D qubit array schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Origin of Subharmonic Gap Structure of DC Current-Biased Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of DC current-biased Josephson junctions, resolving long-standing discrepancies in the subharmonic gap structure (SGS) between theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Applicable to junctions with arbitrary transparencies, our approach surpasses existing theories that fail to reproduce all experimentally observed SGS singularities. Introducing a microscopic Floquet framework, we find a novel two-quasiparticle non-equilibrium tunneling process absent in existing lowest-order tunneling approximations. We attribute the origin of the subharmonics to this non-equilibrium tunneling of the Josephson effect. We elaborate this via two complementary perspectives: in the time domain, as the interference of non-equilibrium current pulses, and in the frequency domain, as a generalized form of multiple Andreev reflections. Our framework extends to various types of Josephson junctions, providing insights into Josephson dynamics critical to quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum transport simulations to investigate the upper limit of spin transport in suspended graphene. We find that thermally-induced atomic-scale corrugations are the dominant factor, limiting spin lifetimes to ~10 ns by inducing a strongly-varying local spin-orbit coupling. These extremely short-range corrugations appear even when the height profile appears to be smooth, suggesting they may be present in any graphene device. We discuss our results in the context of experiments, and briefly consider approaches to suppress these short-range corrugations and further enhance spin lifetimes in graphene-based spin devices.</description>

      <title>Stability of chiral magnon condensate in antiferromagnetic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiequilibrium magnon Bose-Einstein condensates in ferromagnetic insulators have been a field of much interest, while condensation in antiferromagnetic systems has not yet been explored in detail. We analyze the stability of condensed chiral magnons in two antiferromagnetic insulators: a uniaxial easy-axis system and a biaxial system. We show that two-component magnon condensation and inter-magnon interactions are essential to create metastable magnon condensation. The uniaxial system with a Rashba-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction supports two degenerate condensate populations at finite wave vectors. We find that the condensation state in this model is stable only when the distribution of condensed magnons between the two populations is symmetric. In addition, we demonstrate the emergence of a zero-sound-like Goldstone mode in antiferromagnetic systems that support two-condensate magnon states. On the other hand, in the biaxial system without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we predict that the magnon condensate cannot stabilize due to the breaking of the magnon degeneracy. Our results suggest that this instability is a general characteristic of single-component quasiequilibrium quasiparticle condensates.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Performance Terahertz Polarizers by Nanoimprint Lithography for Advanced Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz polarizers are essential for advanced spectroscopic systems but face challenges like low transmission, short bandwidths and low extinction ratios. This study demonstrates the development of ultrabroadband THz polarizers using nanoimprint lithography, achieving high performance through double-wire-grid polarizer (DWGP) structures on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) substrates. Compared to silicon-based alternatives, the polymer DWGPs demonstrated over twice the TM-polarized transmittance across the 0.1 - 25 THz range. The degree of polarization exceeded 98% in a 0.1-16 THz range, with a maximum extinction ratio above 65.4 dB at 4.2 THz.
  Simultaneous characterization of materials using THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) covered extended frequency ranges of 0.1 - 40 THz and 0.9 - 20 THz, respectively. Nanofabricated polymer DWGP revealed the superior optical properties, including enhanced TM transmittance and reduced TE leakage when compared to Si DWGP. Additionally, the fabricated polymer polarizers showcased cost-effectiveness, scalability, and durability, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional Si-based polarizers.
  The significant developments demonstrated in this study position polymer-based DWGPs as significant components for THz imaging, sensing, and wireless communication systems, paving the way for next-generation technologies.</description>

Abstract: The lowest Landau level Hilbert space, or the Bargmann-Fock space, admits a quantized trace for the commutator of its position coordinate operators. We exploit the Carey-Pincus theory of principal functions of trace class commutators to probe this integer quantization result further, and uncover a hidden rational structure in the higher-order commutator-traces. This shows how exact fractional quantization can occur whenever exact integral quantization does.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature quantum sensing with photoexcited triplet electrons in organic crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors have notably advanced high-sensitivity magnetic field detection. Here, we report quantum sensors constructed from polarized spin-triplet electrons in photoexcited organic chromophores, specifically focusing on pentacene-doped para-terphenyl (${\approx}$0.1%). We demonstrate essential quantum sensing properties at room temperature: electronic optical polarization and state-dependent fluorescence contrast, by leveraging differential pumping and relaxation rates between triplet and ground states. We measure high optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast ${\approx}16.8\%$ of the triplet states at room temperature, along with long coherence times under spin echo and CPMG sequences, $T_2{=}2.7\mu$s and $T_2^{DD}{=}18.4\mu$s respectively, limited only by the triplet lifetimes. The material offers several advantages for quantum sensing, including the ability to grow large ($cm$-scale) crystals at low cost, the absence of paramagnetic impurities, and the diamagnetism of electronic states used for sensing when not optically illuminated. Utilizing pentacene as a representative of a broader class of spin triplet-polarizable organic molecules, this study highlights new potential for quantum sensing in chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Enforced symmetry breaking for anomalous valley Hall effect in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE) is a pivotal phenomenon that allows for the exploitation of the valley degree of freedom in materials. A general strategy for its realization and manipulation is crucial for valleytronics. Here, by considering all possible symmetries, we propose general rules for the realization and manipulation of AVHE in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices. The realization of AVHE requires breaking the enforced symmetry that is associated with different valleys or reverses the sign of Berry curvature. Further manipulation of AVHE requires asymmetry operators connecting two states with opposite signs of Berry curvature. These rules for realizing and manipulating AVHE are extendable to generic points in momentum space. Combined with first-principles calculations, we realize the controllable AVHE in four representative systems, i.e., monolayer AgCrP2Se6, CrOBr, FeCl2 and bilayer TcGeSe3. Our work provides symmetry rules for designing valleytronic materials that could facilitate the experimental detection and realistic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field induces a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit such spin polarization using circularly polarized electric fields to second order (as in the usual spin orientation or inverse Faraday effect) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization using linearly polarized electric fields to second order. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. Using density functional theory we compute the spectrum of the second-order electric spin susceptibility of prototypical semiconductors Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that nonlinear photomagnetization can be comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fractional Chern Insulators through Periodic Strain in Monolayer Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Through extensive many-body exact diagonalization, we provide compelling evidence for various fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs, including the Laughlin states, Halperin states, and FCIs with tunable topological orders in Chern number |C| = 2 bands. We also discuss the relationship among band geometry, band filling and spin polarization. Notably, by examining both the entanglement spectrum and many-body Chern number, we reveal a state with Laughlin-like topological order emerging in the |C| = 2 band, which challenges the existing theoretical understanding of high Chern number (high-C) FCIs. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators and underscore the need for further investigation into high-C FCIs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. In principle, quantum dot (QD) lasers are more radiation-resistant than traditional semiconductor lasers because of their superior carrier confinement and smaller active regions. However, the multifaceted nature of radiation effects on QDs resulted in ongoing controversies. Comprehensive testing under simulated space conditions is also necessary to validate their performance. In this work, we conducted radiation tests on various In(Ga)As/GaAs QD and quantum well (QW) materials and devices. Our results revealed that InAs/GaAs QDs with filling factors greater than 50% exhibit greater radiation hardness than those below 50%. Furthermore, most InAs/GaAs QDs showed superior radiation resistance compared to InGaAs/GaAs QW when exposed to low proton fluences of 1E11 and 1E12 cm-2, resulting from radiation-induced defects. The linewidth enhancement factor (LEF) of well-designed QD lasers remains remarkably stable and close to zero, even under proton irradiation at a maximum fluence of 7E13 cm-2, owing to their inherent insensitivity to irradiation-induced defects. These QD lasers demonstrate an exceptional average relative intensity noise (RIN) level of -162 dB/Hz, with only a 1 dB/Hz increase in RIN observed at the highest fluence, indicating outstanding stability. Furthermore, the lasers exhibit remarkable robustness against optical feedback, sustaining stable performance even under a feedback strength as high as -3.1 dB. These results highlight the significant potential of QD lasers for space laser communication applications, where high reliability and resilience to radiation and environmental perturbations are critical.</description>

Abstract: Transporting and connecting quantum states are key capabilities for larger-scale quantum information processing. Concrete challenges are the coherent shuttling and the manipulation of distant quantum states in an optical lattice. Here, we create spin singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pair pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven spin singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>

Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Disordered quantum antiferromagnetism in doped semiconductors: Density of states approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the exchange interaction in a system of spatially disordered magnetic moments. A typical example of such a system is an impurity semiconductor, whose magnetic properties are associated with the exchange interaction of the impurity atoms. In this study, we consider the case of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, which we describe by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. To calculate the magnetic properties of the disordered system, we employ the density of states method. Our calculations demonstrate a good quantitative agreement with the dependence of the Si:P magnetic susceptibility on temperature in a wide range of impurity concentrations and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-locality detection in nano-semiconductors based on lagging models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10962</link>

Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>
