      <title>ProbeWalk: Fast Estimation of Biharmonic Distance on Graphs via Probe-Driven Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The biharmonic distance is a fundamental metric on graphs that measures the dissimilarity between two nodes, capturing both local and global structures. It has found applications across various fields, including network centrality, graph clustering, and machine learning. These applications typically require efficient evaluation of pairwise biharmonic distances. However, existing algorithms remain computationally expensive. The state-of-the-art method attains an absolute-error guarantee epsilon_abs with time complexity O(L^5 / epsilon_abs^2), where L denotes the truncation length. In this work, we improve the complexity to O(L^3 / epsilon^2) under a relative-error guarantee epsilon via probe-driven random walks. We provide a relative-error guarantee rather than an absolute-error guarantee because biharmonic distances vary by orders of magnitude across node pairs. Since L is often very large in real-world networks (for example, L &gt;= 10^3), reducing the L-dependence from the fifth to the third power yields substantial gains. Extensive experiments on real-world networks show that our method delivers 10x-1000x per-query speedups at matched relative error over strong baselines and scales to graphs with tens of millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>The Power of Network Pluralism: Multi-Perspective Modeling of Heterogeneous Legal Document Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insights are relative - influenced by a range of factors such as assumptions, scopes, or methods that together define a research perspective. In normative and empirical fields alike, this insight has led to the conclusion that no single perspective can generate complete knowledge. As a response, epistemological pluralism mandates that researchers consider multiple perspectives simultaneously to obtain a holistic understanding of their phenomenon under study. Translating this mandate to network science, our work introduces Network Pluralism as a conceptual framework that leverages multi-perspectivity to yield more complete, meaningful, and robust results. We develop and demonstrate the benefits of this approach via a hands-on analysis of complex legal systems, constructing a network space from references across documents from different branches of government as well as including organizational hierarchy above and fine-grained structure below the document level. Leveraging the resulting heterogeneity in a multi-network analysis, we show how complementing perspectives can help contextualize otherwise high-level findings, how contrasting several networks derived from the same data enables researchers to learn by difference, and how relating metrics to perspectives may increase the transparency and robustness of network-analytical results. To analyze a space of networks as perspectives, researchers need to map dimensions of variation in a given domain to network-modeling decisions and network-metric parameters. While this remains a challenging and inherently interdisciplinary task, our work acts as a blueprint to facilitate the broader adoption of Network Pluralism in domain-driven network research.</description>

      <title>Job Satisfaction Through the Lens of Social Media: Rural--Urban Patterns in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a novel large-scale social-media-based measure of U.S. job satisfaction, constructed by applying a fine-tuned large language model to 2.6 billion georeferenced tweets, and link it to county-level labor market conditions (2013-2023). Logistic regressions show that rural counties consistently report lower job satisfaction sentiment than urban ones, but this gap decreases under tight labor markets. In contrast to widening rural-urban income disparities, perceived job quality converges when unemployment is low, suggesting that labor market slack, not income alone, drives spatial inequality in subjective work-related well-being.</description>

      <title>Towards agent-based-model informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for designing neural networks that remain consistent with the underlying principles of agent-based models. We begin by highlighting the limitations of standard neural differential equations in modeling complex systems, where physical invariants (like energy) are often absent but other constraints (like mass conservation, network locality, bounded rationality) must be enforced. To address this, we introduce Agent-Based-Model informed Neural Networks(ABM-NNs), which leverage restricted graph neural networks and hierarchical decomposition to learn interpretable, structure-preserving dynamics. We validate the framework across three case studies of increasing complexity: (i) a generalized Generalized Lotka--Volterra system, where we recover ground-truth parameters from short trajectories in presence of interventions; (ii) a graph-based SIR contagion model, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning baselines (GCN, GraphSAGE, Graph Transformer) in out-of-sample forecasting and noise robustness; and (iii) a real-world macroeconomic model of the ten largest economies, where we learn coupled GDP dynamics from empirical data and demonstrate gradient-based counterfactual analysis for policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Finding coherent node groups in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grouping the nodes of a graph into clusters is a standard technique for studying networks. We study a problem where we are given a directed network and are asked to partition the graph into a sequence of coherent groups. We assume that nodes in the network have features, and we measure the group coherence by comparing these features. Furthermore, we incorporate the cross edges by penalizing the forward cross edges and backward cross edges with different weights. If the weights are set to 0, then the problem is equivalent to clustering. However, if we penalize the backward edges, the order of discovered groups matters, and we can view our problem as a generalization of a classic segmentation problem.
  We consider a common iterative approach where we solve the groups given the centroids, and then find the centroids given the groups. We show that, unlike in clustering, the first subproblem is NP-hard. However, we show that we can solve the subproblem exactly if the underlying graph is a tree or if the number of groups is 2. For a general case, we propose an approximation algorithm based on linear programming.
  We propose 3 additional heuristics: (1) optimizing each pair of groups separately while keeping the remaining groups intact, (2) computing a spanning tree and then optimizing using only the edges in that, and (3) a greedy search moving nodes between the groups while optimizing the overall loss. We demonstrate with our experiments that the algorithms are practical and yield interpretable results.</description>

      <title>SoREX: Towards Self-Explainable Social Recommendation with Relevant Ego-Path Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social recommendation has been proven effective in addressing data sparsity in user-item interaction modeling by leveraging social networks. The recent integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has further enhanced prediction accuracy in contemporary social recommendation algorithms. However, many GNN-based approaches in social recommendation lack the ability to furnish meaningful explanations for their predictions. In this study, we confront this challenge by introducing SoREX, a self-explanatory GNN-based social recommendation framework. SoREX adopts a two-tower framework enhanced by friend recommendation, independently modeling social relations and user-item interactions, while jointly optimizing an auxiliary task to reinforce social signals. To offer explanations, we propose a novel ego-path extraction approach. This method involves transforming the ego-net of a target user into a collection of multi-hop ego-paths, from which we extract factor-specific and candidate-aware ego-path subsets as explanations. This process facilitates the summarization of detailed comparative explanations among different candidate items through intricate substructure analysis. Furthermore, we conduct explanation re-aggregation to explicitly correlate explanations with downstream predictions, imbuing our framework with inherent self-explainability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four widely adopted benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of SoREX in predictive accuracy. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm the efficacy of the extracted explanations in SoREX. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/antman9914/SoREX.</description>

      <title>Social Networks: Enumerating Maximal Community Patterns in $c$-Closed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jacob Fox, C. Seshadhri, Tim Roughgarden, Fan Wei, and Nicole Wein introduced the model of $c$-closed graphs--a distribution-free model motivated by triadic closure, one of the most pervasive structural signatures of social networks. While enumerating maximal cliques in general graphs can take exponential time, it is known that in $c$-closed graphs, maximal cliques and maximal complete bipartite subgraphs can always be enumerated in polynomial time. These structures correspond to blow-ups of simple patterns: a single vertex or a single edge, with some vertices required to form cliques. In this work, we explore a natural extension: we study maximal blow-ups of arbitrary finite graphs $H$ in $c$-closed graphs. We prove that for any fixed graph $H$, the number of maximal blow-ups of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $c$-closed graph is always bounded by a polynomial in $n$. We further investigate the case of induced blow-ups and provide a precise characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the number of maximal induced blow-ups is also polynomially bounded in $n$. Finally, we study the analogue questions when $H$ ranges over an infinite family of graphs.</description>
