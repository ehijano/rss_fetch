      <title>Detail Enhanced Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale Volumetric Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unique system for large-scale, multi-performer, high resolution 4D volumetric capture providing realistic free-viewpoint video up to and including 4K resolution facial closeups. To achieve this, we employ a novel volumetric capture, reconstruction and rendering pipeline based on Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion-based Detail Enhancement. We design our pipeline specifically to meet the demands of high-end media production. We employ two capture rigs: the Scene Rig, which captures multi-actor performances at a resolution which falls short of 4K production quality, and the Face Rig, which records high-fidelity single-actor facial detail to serve as a reference for detail enhancement. We first reconstruct dynamic performances from the Scene Rig using 4D Gaussian Splatting, incorporating new model designs and training strategies to improve reconstruction, dynamic range, and rendering quality. Then to render high-quality images for facial closeups, we introduce a diffusion-based detail enhancement model. This model is fine-tuned with high-fidelity data from the same actors recorded in the Face Rig. We train on paired data generated from low- and high-quality Gaussian Splatting (GS) models, using the low-quality input to match the quality of the Scene Rig, with the high-quality GS as ground truth. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline in bridging the gap between the scalable performance capture of a large-scale rig and the high-resolution standards required for film and media production.</description>

      <title>Improving Sparse IMU-based Motion Capture with Motion Label Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based human motion capture has gained significant momentum, driven by the adaptation of fundamental AI tools such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers that are tailored for temporal and spatial modeling. Despite these achievements, current research predominantly focuses on pipeline and architectural designs, with comparatively little attention given to regularization methods, highlighting a critical gap in developing a comprehensive AI toolkit for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose motion label smoothing, a novel method that adapts the classic label smoothing strategy from classification to the sparse IMU-based motion capture task. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a naive adaptation of label smoothing, including simply blending a uniform vector or a ``uniform'' motion representation (e.g., dataset-average motion or a canonical T-pose), is suboptimal; and argue that a proper adaptation requires increasing the entropy of the smoothed labels. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of human motion labels, identifying three critical properties: 1) Temporal Smoothness, 2) Joint Correlation, and 3) Low-Frequency Dominance, and show that conventional approaches to entropy enhancement (e.g., blending Gaussian noise) are ineffective as they disrupt these properties. Finally, we propose the blend of a novel skeleton-based Perlin noise for motion label smoothing, designed to raise label entropy while satisfying motion properties. Extensive experiments applying our motion label smoothing to three state-of-the-art methods across four real-world IMU datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robust generalization (plug-and-play) capability.</description>

      <title>Geodiffussr: Generative Terrain Texturing with Elevation Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale terrain generation remains a labor-intensive task in computer graphics. We introduce Geodiffussr, a flow-matching pipeline that synthesizes text-guided texture maps while strictly adhering to a supplied Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The core mechanism is multi-scale content aggregation (MCA): DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce global-to-local elevation consistency. Compared with a non-MCA baseline, MCA markedly improves visual fidelity and strengthens height-appearance coupling (FID $\downarrow$ 49.16%, LPIPS $\downarrow$ 32.33%, $\Delta$dCor $\downarrow$ to 0.0016). To train and evaluate Geodiffussr, we assemble a globally distributed, biome- and climate-stratified corpus of triplets pairing SRTM-derived DEMs with Sentinel-2 imagery and vision-grounded natural-language captions that describe visible land cover. We position Geodiffussr as a strong baseline and step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Position-Based Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The position-based dynamics (PBD) algorithm is a popular and versatile technique for real-time simulation of deformable bodies, but is only applicable to forces that can be expressed as linearly compliant constraints. In this work, we explore a generalization of PBD that is applicable to arbitrary nonlinear force models. We do this by reformulating the implicit time integration equations in terms of the individual forces in the system, to which applying Gauss-Seidel iterations naturally leads to a PBD-type algorithm. As we demonstrate, our method allows simulation of data-driven cloth models [Sperl et al. 2020] that cannot be represented by existing variations of position-based dynamics, enabling performance improvements over the baseline Newton-based solver for high mesh resolutions. We also show our method's applicability to volumetric neo-Hookean elasticity with an inversion barrier.</description>

      <title>BrepGPT: Autoregressive B-rep Generation with Voronoi Half-Patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Scientific Visualization: Ensemble Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.</description>

      <title>FACT-GS: Frequency-Aligned Complexity-Aware Texture Reparameterization for 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.</description>

Abstract: With the advancement of virtual reality, the demand for 3D human avatars is increasing. The emergence of Gaussian Splatting technology has enabled the rendering of Gaussian avatars with superior visual quality and reduced computational costs. Despite numerous methods researchers propose for implementing drivable Gaussian avatars, limited attention has been given to balancing visual quality and computational costs. In this paper, we introduce LoDAvatar, a method that introduces levels of detail into Gaussian avatars through hierarchical embedding and selective detail enhancement methods. The key steps of LoDAvatar encompass data preparation, Gaussian embedding, Gaussian optimization, and selective detail enhancement. We conducted experiments involving Gaussian avatars at various levels of detail, employing both objective assessments and subjective evaluations. The outcomes indicate that incorporating levels of detail into Gaussian avatars can decrease computational costs during rendering while upholding commendable visual quality, thereby enhancing runtime frame rates. We advocate adopting LoDAvatar to render multiple dynamic Gaussian avatars or extensive Gaussian scenes to balance visual quality and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Attribute Binding for Free-Lunch Color Control in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled remarkable control over various attributes, yet precise color specification remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches, such as ColorPeel, rely on model personalization, requiring additional optimization and limiting flexibility in specifying arbitrary colors. In this work, we introduce ColorWave, a novel training-free approach that achieves exact RGB-level color control in diffusion models without fine-tuning. By systematically analyzing the cross-attention mechanisms within IP-Adapter, we uncover an implicit binding between textual color descriptors and reference image features. Leveraging this insight, our method rewires these bindings to enforce precise color attribution while preserving the generative capabilities of pretrained models. Our approach maintains generation quality and diversity, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and applicability across diverse object categories. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that ColorWave establishes a new paradigm for structured, color-consistent diffusion-based image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Let it Snow! Animating 3D Gaussian Scenes with Dynamic Weather Effects via Physics-Guided Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, dynamic editing of such scenes remains a significant challenge. We introduce a novel framework, Physics-Guided Score Distillation, to address a fundamental conflict: physics simulation provides a strong motion prior that is insufficient for photorealism , while video-based Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) alone cannot generate coherent motion for complex, multi-particle scenarios. We resolve this through a unified optimization framework where physics simulation guides Score Distillation to jointly refine the motion prior for photorealism while simultaneously optimizing appearance. Specifically, we learn a neural dynamics model that predicts particle motion and appearance, optimized end-to-end via a combined loss integrating Video-SDS for photorealism with our physics-guidance prior. This allows for photorealistic refinements while ensuring the dynamics remain plausible. Our framework enables scene-wide dynamic weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, with physically plausible motion. Experiments demonstrate our physics-guided approach significantly outperforms baselines, with ablations confirming this joint refinement is essential for generating coherent, high-fidelity dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural Octahedral Field: Octahedral prior for simultaneous smoothing and sharp edge regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of a continuous distance function as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. In the presence of noise, however, its lack of explicit neighborhood connectivity makes sharp edges identification particularly challenging, hence preventing the separation of smoothing and sharpening operations, as is achievable with its discrete counterparts. In this work, we propose to tackle this challenge with an auxiliary field, the \emph{octahedral field}. We observe that both smoothness and sharp features in the distance field can be equivalently described by the smoothness in octahedral space. Therefore, by aligning and smoothing an octahedral field alongside the implicit geometry, our method behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting in a smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges. Despite being operated purely pointwise, our method outperforms various traditional and neural implicit fitting approaches across extensive experiments, and is very competitive with methods that require normals and data priors. Code and data of our work are available at: https://github.com/Ankbzpx/frame-field.</description>

      <title>SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds using Neural Variational Heat Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</description>
