      <title>Nonlinearity and Uncertainty Informed Moment-Matching Gaussian Mixture Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in navigation and tracking require increasingly accurate characterizations of the evolution of uncertainty in nonlinear systems. Nonlinear uncertainty propagation approaches based on Gaussian mixture density approximations offer distinct advantages over sampling based methods in their computational cost and continuous representation. State-of-the-art Gaussian mixture approaches are adaptive in that individual Gaussian mixands are selectively split into mixtures to yield better approximations of the true propagated distribution. Despite the importance of the splitting process to accuracy and computational efficiency, relatively little work has been devoted to mixand selection and splitting direction optimization. The first part of this work presents splitting methods that preserve the mean and covariance of the original distribution. Then, we present and compare a number of novel heuristics for selecting the splitting direction. The choice of splitting direction is informed by the initial uncertainty distribution, properties of the nonlinear function through which the original distribution is propagated, and a whitening based natural scaling method to avoid dependence of the splitting direction on the scaling of coordinates. We compare these novel heuristics to existing techniques in three distinct examples involving Cartesian to polar coordinate transformation, Keplerian orbital element propagation, and uncertainty propagation in the circular restricted three-body problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Particle-based Approximation of Discrete Distributions (OPAD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based methods include a variety of techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), for approximating a probabilistic target distribution with a set of weighted particles. In this paper, we prove that for any set of particles, there is a unique weighting mechanism that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the (particle-based) approximation from the target distribution, when that distribution is discrete -- any other weighting mechanism (e.g. MCMC weighting that is based on particles' repetitions in the Markov chain) is sub-optimal with respect to this divergence measure. Our proof does not require any restrictions either on the target distribution, or the process by which the particles are generated, other than the discreteness of the target. We show that the optimal weights can be determined based on values that any existing particle-based method already computes; As such, with minimal modifications and no extra computational costs, the performance of any particle-based method can be improved. Our empirical evaluations are carried out on important applications of discrete distributions including Bayesian Variable Selection and Bayesian Structure Learning. The results illustrate that our proposed reweighting of the particles improves any particle-based approximation to the target distribution consistently and often substantially.</description>

      <title>Explicit and data-Efficient Encoding via Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</description>

      <title>A Note on Estimation Error Bound and Grouping Effect of Transfer Elastic Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transfer Elastic Net is an estimation method for linear regression models that combines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm penalties to facilitate knowledge transfer. In this study, we derive a non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ norm estimation error bound for the estimator and discuss scenarios where the Transfer Elastic Net effectively works. Furthermore, we examine situations where it exhibits the grouping effect, which states that the estimates corresponding to highly correlated predictors have a small difference.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Modelling for Discrete and Mixed Data via Heat Equations on Structured Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for probabilistic modelling across various data domains. However, training EBMs on data in discrete or mixed state spaces poses significant challenges due to the lack of robust and fast sampling methods. In this work, we propose to train discrete EBMs with Energy Discrepancy, a loss function which only requires the evaluation of the energy function at data points and their perturbed counterparts, thus eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce perturbations of the data distribution by simulating a diffusion process on the discrete state space endowed with a graph structure. This allows us to inform the choice of perturbation from the structure of the modelled discrete variable, while the continuous time parameter enables fine-grained control of the perturbation. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches in a wide range of applications, including the estimation of discrete densities with non-binary vocabulary and binary image modelling. Finally, we train EBMs on tabular data sets with applications in synthetic data generation and calibrated classification.</description>

      <title>On the Feature Learning in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predominant success of diffusion models in generative modeling has spurred significant interest in understanding their theoretical foundations. In this work, we propose a feature learning framework aimed at analyzing and comparing the training dynamics of diffusion models with those of traditional classification models. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under identical settings, diffusion models, due to the denoising objective, are encouraged to learn more balanced and comprehensive representations of the data. In contrast, neural networks with a similar architecture trained for classification tend to prioritize learning specific patterns in the data, often focusing on easy-to-learn components. To support these theoretical insights, we conduct several experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which empirically validate our findings and highlight the distinct feature learning dynamics in diffusion models compared to classification.</description>

      <title>Spatial Conformal Inference through Localized Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification at unobserved spatial locations, especially in the presence of complex and heterogeneous datasets, remains a core challenge in spatial statistics. Traditional approaches like Kriging rely heavily on assumptions such as normality, which often break down in large-scale, diverse datasets, leading to unreliable prediction intervals. While machine learning methods have emerged as powerful alternatives, they primarily focus on point predictions and provide limited mechanisms for uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free framework, offers valid prediction intervals without relying on parametric assumptions. However, existing conformal prediction methods are either not tailored for spatial settings, or existing ones for spatial data have relied on rather restrictive i.i.d. assumptions. In this paper, we propose Localized Spatial Conformal Prediction (LSCP), a conformal prediction method designed specifically for spatial data. LSCP leverages localized quantile regression to construct prediction intervals. Instead of i.i.d. assumptions, our theoretical analysis builds on weaker conditions of stationarity and spatial mixing, which is natural for spatial data, providing finite-sample bounds on the conditional coverage gap and establishing asymptotic guarantees for conditional coverage. We present experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that LSCP achieves accurate coverage with significantly tighter and more consistent prediction intervals across the spatial domain compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Reliable and scalable variable importance estimation via warm-start and early stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As opaque black-box predictive models become more prevalent, the need to develop interpretations for these models is of great interest. The concept of variable importance and Shapley values are interpretability measures that applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating variable importance presents a significant computational challenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start using the dropout method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an iterative kernel update equation. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the theory for early stopping of kernel-based methods for neural networks with sufficiently large (but not necessarily infinite) width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric trees as a weaker learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>First numerical observation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades.
  The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities.
  However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking.
  In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context sensitive grammars (CSG), and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model.
  We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly 0 to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider.
  Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase.
  This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but is generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.</description>

      <title>Refined Analysis of Federated Averaging's Bias and Federated Richardson-Romberg Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel analysis of FedAvg with constant step size, relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We demonstrate that the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution and analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problem's solution. We provide a first-order expansion of the bias in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct components: one that depends solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on client heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to mitigate this bias.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Hybrid Regularization for Nonlinear Dynamics Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown great potential in modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with uncertainties. This paper presents an RSCN with hybrid regularization to enhance both the learning capacity and generalization performance of the network. Given a set of temporal data, the well-known least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to identify the significant order variables. Subsequently, an improved RSCN with L2 regularization is introduced to approximate the residuals between the output of the target plant and the LASSO model. The output weights are updated in real-time through a projection algorithm, facilitating a rapid response to dynamic changes within the system. A theoretical analysis of the universal approximation property is provided, contributing to the understanding of the network's effectiveness in representing various complex nonlinear functions. Experimental results from a nonlinear system identification problem and two industrial predictive tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other models across all testing datasets.</description>

      <title>Task Singular Vectors: Reducing Task Interference in Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task Arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet effective method to merge models without additional training. However, by treating entire networks as flat parameter vectors, it overlooks key structural information and is susceptible to task interference. In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Steering Rectified Flow Models in the Vector Field for Controlled Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photorealism, image editing, and solving inverse problems, aided by classifier-free guidance and image inversion techniques. However, rectified flow models (RFMs) remain underexplored for these tasks. Existing DM-based methods often require additional training, lack generalization to pretrained latent models, underperform, and demand significant computational resources due to extensive backpropagation through ODE solvers and inversion processes. In this work, we first develop a theoretical and empirical understanding of the vector field dynamics of RFMs in efficiently guiding the denoising trajectory. Our findings reveal that we can navigate the vector field in a deterministic and gradient-free manner. Utilizing this property, we propose FlowChef, which leverages the vector field to steer the denoising trajectory for controlled image generation tasks, facilitated by gradient skipping. FlowChef is a unified framework for controlled image generation that, for the first time, simultaneously addresses classifier guidance, linear inverse problems, and image editing without the need for extra training, inversion, or intensive backpropagation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations and show that FlowChef significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance, memory, and time requirements, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Prediction of B-Cell Epitopes for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: Enhancing Vaccine Design through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of B-cell epitopes is critical for guiding vaccine development against infectious diseases, including SARS and COVID-19. This study explores the use of a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict B-cell epitopes for SARS-CoVandSARS-CoV-2,leveraging a dataset that incorporates essential protein and peptide features. Traditional sequence-based methods often struggle with large, complex datasets, but deep learning offers promising improvements in predictive accuracy. Our model employs regularization techniques, such as dropout and early stopping, to enhance generalization, while also analyzing key features, including isoelectric point and aromaticity, that influence epitope recognition. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 82% in predicting COVID-19 negative and positive cases, with room for improvement in detecting positive samples. This research demonstrates the applicability of deep learning in epitope mapping, suggesting that such approaches can enhance the speed and precision of vaccine design for emerging pathogens. Future work could incorporate structural data and diverse viral strains to further refine prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present batch-consistent inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement frame. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 2.5 minutes on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Stochastic Normalizing Flows in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Guided Sampling with Pixel-Wise Aleatoric Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in generative modelling, current diffusion models lack a quantitative approach to assess image quality. To address this limitation, we propose to estimate the pixel-wise aleatoric uncertainty during the sampling phase of diffusion models and utilise the uncertainty to improve the sample generation quality. The uncertainty is computed as the variance of the denoising scores with a perturbation scheme that is specifically designed for diffusion models. We then show that the aleatoric uncertainty estimates are related to the second-order derivative of the diffusion noise distribution. We evaluate our uncertainty estimation algorithm and the uncertainty-guided sampling on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets. In our comparisons with the related work, we demonstrate promising results in filtering out low quality samples. Furthermore, we show that our guided approach leads to better sample generation in terms of FID scores.</description>

      <title>BOTS: Batch Bayesian Optimization of Extended Thompson Sampling for Severely Episode-Limited RL Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings where the application of reinforcement learning (RL) requires running real-world trials, including the optimization of adaptive health interventions, the number of episodes available for learning can be severely limited due to cost or time constraints. In this setting, the bias-variance trade-off of contextual bandit methods can be significantly better than that of more complex full RL methods. However, Thompson sampling bandits are limited to selecting actions based on distributions of immediate rewards. In this paper, we extend the linear Thompson sampling bandit to select actions based on a state-action utility function consisting of the Thompson sampler's estimate of the expected immediate reward combined with an action bias term. We use batch Bayesian optimization over episodes to learn the action bias terms with the goal of maximizing the expected return of the extended Thompson sampler. The proposed approach is able to learn optimal policies for a strictly broader class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) than standard Thompson sampling. Using an adaptive intervention simulation environment that captures key aspects of behavioral dynamics, we show that the proposed method can significantly out-perform standard Thompson sampling in terms of total return, while requiring significantly fewer episodes than standard value function and policy gradient methods.</description>

      <title>One Model for One Graph: A New Perspective for Pretraining with Cross-domain Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to capture intricate network patterns, achieving success across different domains. However, existing GNNs require careful domain-specific architecture designs and training from scratch on each dataset, leading to an expertise-intensive process with difficulty in generalizing across graphs from different domains. Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, "one model for one graph," which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on both link prediction and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in graph representation learning across various real-world applications. However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.</description>

      <title>On Foundation Models for Dynamical Systems from Purely Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable generalization, data efficiency, and robustness properties across various domains. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control domain. The success of these models is enabled by large-scale pretaining on Internet-scale datasets. These are available in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, but do not exist for dynamical systems. We address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model exclusively on synthetic data and propose to sample dynamics functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>AutoPQ: Automating Quantile estimation from Point forecasts in the context of sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing smart grid operations relies on critical decision-making informed by uncertainty quantification, making probabilistic forecasting a vital tool. Designing such forecasting models involves three key challenges: accurate and unbiased uncertainty quantification, workload reduction for data scientists during the design process, and limitation of the environmental impact of model training. In order to address these challenges, we introduce AutoPQ, a novel method designed to automate and optimize probabilistic forecasting for smart grid applications. AutoPQ enhances forecast uncertainty quantification by generating quantile forecasts from an existing point forecast by using a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). AutoPQ also automates the selection of the underlying point forecasting method and the optimization of hyperparameters, ensuring that the best model and configuration is chosen for each application. For flexible adaptation to various performance needs and available computing power, AutoPQ comes with a default and an advanced configuration, making it suitable for a wide range of smart grid applications. Additionally, AutoPQ provides transparency regarding the electricity consumption required for performance improvements. We show that AutoPQ outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting methods while effectively limiting computational effort and hence environmental impact. Additionally and in the context of sustainability, we quantify the electricity consumption required for performance improvements.</description>

      <title>TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

      <title>On autoregressive deep learning models for day-ahead wind power forecasting with irregular shutdowns due to redispatching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable energies and their operation are becoming increasingly vital for the stability of electrical power grids since conventional power plants are progressively being displaced, and their contribution to redispatch interventions is thereby diminishing. In order to consider renewable energies like Wind Power (WP) for such interventions as a substitute, day-ahead forecasts are necessary to communicate their availability for redispatch planning. In this context, automated and scalable forecasting models are required for the deployment to thousands of locally-distributed onshore WP turbines. Furthermore, the irregular interventions into the WP generation capabilities due to redispatch shutdowns pose challenges in the design and operation of WP forecasting models. Since state-of-the-art forecasting methods consider past WP generation values alongside day-ahead weather forecasts, redispatch shutdowns may impact the forecast. Therefore, the present paper highlights these challenges and analyzes state-of-the-art forecasting methods on data sets with both regular and irregular shutdowns. Specifically, we compare the forecasting accuracy of three autoregressive Deep Learning (DL) methods to methods based on WP curve modeling. Interestingly, the latter achieve lower forecasting errors, have fewer requirements for data cleaning during modeling and operation while being computationally more efficient, suggesting their advantages in practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a mathematical approach that (re)defines a property of Machine Learning models named stability and determines sufficient conditions to validate it. Machine Learning models are represented as functions, and the characteristics in scope depend upon the domain of the function, what allows us to adopt topological and metric spaces theory as a basis. Finally, this work provides some equivalences useful to prove and test stability in Machine Learning models. The results suggest that whenever stability is aligned with the notion of function smoothness, then the stability of Machine Learning models primarily depends upon certain topological, measurable properties of the classification sets within the ML model domain.</description>

      <title>A Probably Approximately Correct Analysis of Group Testing Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the defectives from a population of items via a non-adaptive group testing framework with a random pooling-matrix design. We analyze the sufficient number of tests needed for approximate set identification, i.e., for identifying almost all the defective and non-defective items with high confidence. To this end, we view the group testing problem as a function learning problem and develop our analysis using the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. Using this formulation, we derive sufficiency bounds on the number of tests for three popular binary group testing algorithms: column matching, combinatorial basis pursuit, and definite defectives. We compare the derived bounds with the existing ones in the literature for exact recovery theoretically and using simulations. Finally, we contrast the three group testing algorithms under consideration in terms of the sufficient testing rate surface and the sufficient number of tests contours across the range of the approximation and confidence levels.</description>

      <title>A novel algorithm for the decomposition of non-stationary multidimensional and multivariate signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a signal is a fundamental tool in many fields of research, including signal processing, geophysics, astrophysics, engineering, medicine, and many more. By breaking down complex signals into simpler oscillatory components we can enhance the understanding and processing of the data, unveiling hidden information contained in them. Traditional methods, such as Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms, which are effective in handling mono-dimensional stationary signals struggle with non-stationary data sets and they require, this is the case of the wavelet, the selection of predefined basis functions. In contrast, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method and its variants, such as Iterative Filtering (IF), have emerged as effective nonlinear approaches, adapting to signals without any need for a priori assumptions. To accelerate these methods, the Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF) algorithm was developed, and further extensions, such as Multivariate FIF (MvFIF) and Multidimensional FIF (FIF2), have been proposed to handle higher-dimensional data.
  In this work, we introduce the Multidimensional and Multivariate Fast Iterative Filtering (MdMvFIF) technique, an innovative method that extends FIF to handle data that vary simultaneously in space and time. This new algorithm is capable of extracting Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) from complex signals that vary in both space and time, overcoming limitations found in prior methods. The potentiality of the proposed method is demonstrated through applications to artificial and real-life signals, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in decomposing multidimensional and multivariate nonstationary signals. The MdMvFIF method offers a powerful tool for advanced signal analysis across many scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Revisit Non-parametric Two-sample Testing as a Semi-supervised Learning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning effective data representations is crucial in answering if two samples X and Y are from the same distribution (a.k.a. the non-parametric two-sample testing problem), which can be categorized into: i) learning discriminative representations (DRs) that distinguish between two samples in a supervised-learning paradigm, and ii) learning inherent representations (IRs) focusing on data's inherent features in an unsupervised-learning paradigm. However, both paradigms have issues: learning DRs reduces the data points available for the two-sample testing phase, and learning purely IRs misses discriminative cues. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel perspective to consider non-parametric two-sample testing as a semi-supervised learning (SSL) problem, introducing the SSL-based Classifier Two-Sample Test (SSL-C2ST) framework. While a straightforward implementation of SSL-C2ST might directly use existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) SSL methods to train a classifier with labeled data (with sample indexes X or Y) and unlabeled data (the remaining ones in the two samples), conventional two-sample testing data often exhibits substantial overlap between samples and violates SSL methods' assumptions, resulting in low test power. Therefore, we propose a two-step approach: first, learn IRs using all data, then fine-tune IRs with only labelled data to learn DRs, which can both utilize information from whole dataset and adapt the discriminative power to the given data. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that SSL-C2ST outperforms traditional C2ST by effectively leveraging unlabeled data. We also offer a stronger empirically designed test achieving the SOTA performance in many two-sample testing datasets.</description>

      <title>DFRot: Achieving Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free for Rotated LLMs with Refined Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00648v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomena remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.25 and 0.21 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-8B, a model known for its quantization challenges.</description>

      <title>Predictive Inference With Fast Feature Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely adopted in uncertainty quantification, due to its post-hoc, distribution-free, and model-agnostic properties. In the realm of modern deep learning, researchers have proposed Feature Conformal Prediction (FCP), which deploys conformal prediction in a feature space, yielding reduced band lengths. However, the practical utility of FCP is limited due to the time-consuming non-linear operations required to transform confidence bands from feature space to output space. In this paper, we introduce Fast Feature Conformal Prediction (FFCP), which features a novel non-conformity score and is convenient for practical applications. FFCP serves as a fast version of FCP, in that it equivalently employs a Taylor expansion to approximate the aforementioned non-linear operations in FCP. Empirical validations showcase that FFCP performs comparably with FCP (both outperforming the vanilla version) while achieving a significant reduction in computational time by approximately 50x.

      <title>Improving Decoupled Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems using Data Consistency Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performances in solving inverse problems through posterior sampling while they suffer from errors during earlier steps. To mitigate this issue, several Decoupled Posterior Sampling methods have been recently proposed. However, the reverse process in these methods ignores measurement information, leading to errors that impede effective optimization in subsequent steps. To solve this problem, we propose Guided Decoupled Posterior Sampling (GDPS) by integrating a data consistency constraint in the reverse process. The constraint performs a smoother transition within the optimization process, facilitating a more effective convergence toward the target distribution. Furthermore, we extend our method to latent diffusion models and Tweedie's formula, demonstrating its scalability. We evaluate GDPS on the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets across various linear and nonlinear tasks under both standard and challenging conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that GDPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Outputs Are More Sensitive Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on deep computer vision models that process sensitive data has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the exposure of intermediate results in hidden layers. While traditional privacy risk assessment techniques focus on protecting overall model outputs, they often overlook vulnerabilities within these intermediate representations. Current privacy risk assessment techniques typically rely on specific attack simulations to assess risk, which can be computationally expensive and incomplete. This paper introduces a novel approach to measuring privacy risks in deep computer vision models based on the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) and sensitivity of intermediate outputs, without requiring adversarial attack simulations. We propose a framework that leverages DoF to evaluate the amount of information retained in each layer and combines this with the rank of the Jacobian matrix to assess sensitivity to input variations. This dual analysis enables systematic measurement of privacy risks at various model layers. Our experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in providing deeper insights into privacy risks associated with intermediate representations.</description>

      <title>Bridging Fairness Gaps: A (Conditional) Distance Covariance Perspective in Fairness Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bridge fairness gaps from a statistical perspective by selectively utilizing either conditional distance covariance or distance covariance statistics as measures to assess the independence between predictions and sensitive attributes. We enhance fairness by incorporating sample (conditional) distance covariance as a manageable penalty term into the machine learning process. Additionally, we present the matrix form of empirical (conditional) distance covariance for parallel calculations to enhance computational efficiency. Theoretically, we provide a proof for the convergence between empirical and population (conditional) distance covariance, establishing necessary guarantees for batch computations. Through experiments conducted on a range of real-world datasets, we have demonstrated that our method effectively bridges the fairness gap in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Rising Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial online learning is a fundamental task to decide the optimal combination of base arms in sequential interactions with systems providing uncertain rewards, which is applicable to diverse domains such as robotics, social advertising, network routing and recommendation systems. In real-world scenarios, we often observe rising rewards, where the selection of a base arm not only provides an instantaneous reward but also contributes to the enhancement of future rewards, {\it e.g.}, robots enhancing proficiency through practice and social influence strengthening in the history of successful recommendations. To address this, we introduce the problem of combinatorial rising bandit to minimize policy regret and propose a provably efficient algorithm, called Combinatorial Rising Upper Confidence Bound (CRUCB), of which regret upper bound is close to a regret lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not provide a sub-linear regret lower bound, making it impossible to assess the efficiency of their algorithms. However, we provide the sub-linear regret lower bound for combinatorial rising bandit and show that CRUCB is provably efficient by showing that the regret upper bound is close to the regret lower bound. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CRUCB not only in synthetic environments but also in realistic applications of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to formalise the task of continual semi-supervised anomaly detection (CSAD), with the aim of highlighting the importance of such a problem formulation which assumes as close to real-world conditions as possible. After an overview of the relevant definitions of continual semi-supervised learning, its components, anomaly detection extension, and the training protocols; the paper introduces a baseline model of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to work with semi-supervised data along with a continual learning method of deep generative replay with outlier rejection. The results show that such a use of extreme value theory (EVT) applied to anomaly detection can provide promising results even in comparison to an upper baseline of joint training. The results explore the effects of how much labelled and unlabelled data is present, of which class, and where it is located in the data stream. Outlier rejection shows promising initial results where it often surpasses a baseline method of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). A baseline for CSAD is put forward along with the specific dataset setups used for reproducability and testability for other practitioners. Future research directions include other CSAD settings and further research into efficient continual hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Quantifying perturbation impacts for large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying how an input perturbation impacts the outputs of large language models (LLMs), a fundamental task for model reliability and post-hoc interpretability. A key obstacle in this domain is disentangling the meaningful changes in model responses from the intrinsic stochasticity of LLM outputs. To overcome this, we introduce Distribution-Based Perturbation Analysis (DBPA), a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. DBPA constructs empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling. Comparisons of Monte Carlo estimates in the reduced dimensionality space enables tractable frequentist inference without relying on restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is model-agnostic, supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, yields interpretable p-values, supports multiple perturbation testing via controlled error rates, and provides scalar effect sizes for any chosen similarity or distance metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DBPA in evaluating perturbation impacts, showing its versatility for perturbation analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Augmented Testing of Discrete Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of hypothesis testing for discrete distributions. In the standard model, where we have sample access to an underlying distribution $p$, extensive research has established optimal bounds for uniformity testing, identity testing (goodness of fit), and closeness testing (equivalence or two-sample testing). We explore these problems in a setting where a predicted data distribution, possibly derived from historical data or predictive machine learning models, is available. We demonstrate that such a predictor can indeed reduce the number of samples required for all three property testing tasks. The reduction in sample complexity depends directly on the predictor's quality, measured by its total variation distance from $p$. A key advantage of our algorithms is their adaptability to the precision of the prediction. Specifically, our algorithms can self-adjust their sample complexity based on the accuracy of the available prediction, operating without any prior knowledge of the estimation's accuracy (i.e. they are consistent). Additionally, we never use more samples than the standard approaches require, even if the predictions provide no meaningful information (i.e. they are also robust). We provide lower bounds to indicate that the improvements in sample complexity achieved by our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal. Furthermore, experimental results show that the performance of our algorithms on real data significantly exceeds our worst-case guarantees for sample complexity, demonstrating the practicality of our approach.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to manipulated updates from clients. In this work we study the impact of data heterogeneity on clients' incentives to manipulate their updates. We formulate a game in which clients may upscale their gradient updates in order to ``steer'' the server model to their advantage. We develop a payment rule that disincentivizes sending large gradient updates, and steers the clients towards truthfully reporting their gradients. We also derive explicit bounds on the clients' payments and the convergence rate of the global model, which allows us to study the trade-off between heterogeneity, payments and convergence.</description>

      <title>MuSiCNet: A Gradual Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irregularly sampled multivariate time series (ISMTS) are prevalent in reality. Most existing methods treat ISMTS as synchronized regularly sampled time series with missing values, neglecting that the irregularities are primarily attributed to variations in sampling rates. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective that irregularity is essentially relative in some senses. With sampling rates artificially determined from low to high, an irregularly sampled time series can be transformed into a hierarchical set of relatively regular time series from coarse to fine. We observe that additional coarse-grained relatively regular series not only mitigate the irregularly sampled challenges to some extent but also incorporate broad-view temporal information, thereby serving as a valuable asset for representation learning. Therefore, following the philosophy of learning that Seeing the big picture first, then delving into the details, we present the Multi-Scale and Multi-Correlation Attention Network (MuSiCNet) combining multiple scales to iteratively refine the ISMTS representation. Specifically, within each scale, we explore time attention and frequency correlation matrices to aggregate intra- and inter-series information, naturally enhancing the representation quality with richer and more intrinsic details. While across adjacent scales, we employ a representation rectification method containing contrastive learning and reconstruction results adjustment to further improve representation consistency. MuSiCNet is an ISMTS analysis framework that competitive with SOTA in three mainstream tasks consistently, including classification, interpolation, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Lookahead Counterfactual Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in applications that involve humans, concerns have arisen that these algorithms may be biased against certain social groups. \textit{Counterfactual fairness} (CF) is a fairness notion proposed in Kusner et al. (2017) that measures the unfairness of ML predictions; it requires that the prediction perceived by an individual in the real world has the same marginal distribution as it would be in a counterfactual world, in which the individual belongs to a different group. Although CF ensures fair ML predictions, it fails to consider the downstream effects of ML predictions on individuals. Since humans are strategic and often adapt their behaviors in response to the ML system, predictions that satisfy CF may not lead to a fair future outcome for the individuals. In this paper, we introduce \textit{lookahead counterfactual fairness} (LCF), a fairness notion accounting for the downstream effects of ML models which requires the individual \textit{future status} to be counterfactually fair. We theoretically identify conditions under which LCF can be satisfied and propose an algorithm based on the theorems. We also extend the concept to path-dependent fairness. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Graph Community Augmentation with GMM-based Modeling in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the issue of graph generation with generative models. In particular, we are concerned with graph community augmentation problem, which refers to the problem of generating unseen or unfamiliar graphs with a new community out of the probability distribution estimated with a given graph dataset. The graph community augmentation means that the generated graphs have a new community. There is a chance of discovering an unseen but important structure of graphs with a new community, for example, in a social network such as a purchaser network. Graph community augmentation may also be helpful for generalization of data mining models in a case where it is difficult to collect real graph data enough. In fact, there are many ways to generate a new community in an existing graph. It is desirable to discover a new graph with a new community beyond the given graph while we keep the structure of the original graphs to some extent for the generated graphs to be realistic. To this end, we propose an algorithm called the graph community augmentation (GCA). The key ideas of GCA are (i) to fit Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to data points in the latent space into which the nodes in the original graph are embedded, and (ii) to add data points in the new cluster in the latent space for generating a new community based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GCA for generating graphs with a new community structure on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of learning distance functions within the query-based learning framework, where a learner is able to pose triplet queries of the form: ``Is $x_i$ closer to $x_j$ or $x_k$?'' We establish formal guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth, but otherwise general, distance functions under two notions of approximation: $\omega$-additive approximation and $(1 + \omega)$-multiplicative approximation. For the additive approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the size of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we introduce a method that combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis distance functions to capture local geometry. This method has a query complexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the cover and the ambient space dimension of the sample space.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Influence Function for Data Attribution with Non-Decomposable Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence function, a technique rooted in robust statistics, has been adapted in modern machine learning for a novel application: data attribution -- quantifying how individual training data points affect a model's predictions. However, the common derivation of influence functions in the data attribution literature is limited to loss functions that can be decomposed into a sum of individual data point losses, with the most prominent examples known as M-estimators. This restricts the application of influence functions to more complex learning objectives, which we refer to as non-decomposable losses, such as contrastive or ranking losses, where a unit loss term depends on multiple data points and cannot be decomposed further. In this work, we bridge this gap by revisiting the general formulation of influence function from robust statistics, which extends beyond M-estimators. Based on this formulation, we propose a novel method, the Versatile Influence Function (VIF), that can be straightforwardly applied to machine learning models trained with any non-decomposable loss. In comparison to the classical approach in statistics, the proposed VIF is designed to fully leverage the power of auto-differentiation, hereby eliminating the need for case-specific derivations of each loss function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VIF across three examples: Cox regression for survival analysis, node embedding for network analysis, and listwise learning-to-rank for information retrieval. In all cases, the influence estimated by VIF closely resembles the results obtained by brute-force leave-one-out retraining, while being up to $10^3$ times faster to compute. We believe VIF represents a significant advancement in data attribution, enabling efficient influence-function-based attribution across a wide range of machine learning paradigms, with broad potential for practical use cases.</description>

      <title>Negative Token Merging: Image-based Adversarial Feature Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-based adversarial guidance using a negative prompt has emerged as a widely adopted approach to push the output features away from undesired concepts. While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be insufficient to capture complex visual concepts and avoid undesired visual elements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we explore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial guidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images in a batch. In particular, we introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but effective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance by selectively pushing apart matching semantic features (between reference and output generation) during the reverse diffusion process. When used w.r.t. other images in the same batch, we observe that NegToMe significantly increases output diversity (racial, gender, visual) without sacrificing output image quality. Similarly, when used w.r.t. a reference copyrighted asset, NegToMe helps reduce visual similarity with copyrighted content by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code, uses only marginally higher (&lt;4%) inference times and generalizes to different diffusion architectures like Flux, which do not natively support the use of a separate negative prompt.

      <title>Practical Performative Policy Learning with Strategic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performative policy learning problem, where agents adjust their features in response to a released policy to improve their potential outcomes, inducing an endogenous distribution shift. There has been growing interest in training machine learning models in strategic environments, including strategic classification and performative prediction. However, existing approaches often rely on restrictive parametric assumptions: micro-level utility models in strategic classification and macro-level data distribution maps in performative prediction, severely limiting scalability and generalizability. We approach this problem as a complex causal inference task, relaxing parametric assumptions on both micro-level agent behavior and macro-level data distribution. Leveraging bounded rationality, we uncover a practical low-dimensional structure in distribution shifts and construct an effective mediator in the causal path from the deployed model to the shifted data. We then propose a gradient-based policy optimization algorithm with a differentiable classifier as a substitute for the high-dimensional distribution map. Our algorithm efficiently utilizes batch feedback and limited manipulation patterns. Our approach achieves high sample efficiency compared to methods reliant on bandit feedback or zero-order optimization. We also provide theoretical guarantees for algorithmic convergence. Extensive and challenging experiments on high-dimensional settings demonstrate our method's practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical VAE with a Diffusion-based VampPrior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep hierarchical variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful latent variable generative models. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical VAE with Diffusion-based Variational Mixture of the Posterior Prior (VampPrior). We apply amortization to scale the VampPrior to models with many stochastic layers. The proposed approach allows us to achieve better performance compared to the original VampPrior work and other deep hierarchical VAEs, while using fewer parameters. We empirically validate our method on standard benchmark datasets (MNIST, OMNIGLOT, CIFAR10) and demonstrate improved training stability and latent space utilization.</description>

      <title>RaD: A Metric for Medical Image Distribution Comparison in Out-of-Domain Detection and Other Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different domain is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning, where domain shift is a common problem that commonly results in decreased model performance. This determination is also important to evaluate the output quality of generative models, e.g., image-to-image translation models used to mitigate domain shift. Current metrics for this either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., FID) from natural imaging which insufficiently capture anatomical consistency and realism in medical images. We introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images: Radiomic Feature Distance (RaD), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful and interpretable image features. We show that RaD is superior to other metrics for out-of-domain (OOD) detection in a variety of experiments. Furthermore, RaD outperforms previous perceptual metrics (FID, KID, etc.) for image-to-image translation by correlating more strongly with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism, and shows similar utility for evaluating unconditional image generation. RaD also offers additional benefits such as interpretability, as well as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes. Our results are supported by broad experiments spanning four multi-domain medical image datasets, nine downstream tasks, six image translation models, and other factors, highlighting the broad potential of RaD for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>How Much Can Time-related Features Enhance Time Series Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) have primarily focused on capturing cross-time and cross-variate (channel) dependencies within historical data. However, a critical aspect often overlooked by many existing methods is the explicit incorporation of \textbf{time-related features} (e.g., season, month, day of the week, hour, minute), which are essential components of time series data. The absence of this explicit time-related encoding limits the ability of current models to capture cyclical or seasonal trends and long-term dependencies, especially with limited historical input. To address this gap, we introduce a simple yet highly efficient module designed to encode time-related features, Time Stamp Forecaster (TimeSter), thereby enhancing the backbone's forecasting performance. By integrating TimeSter with a linear backbone, our model, TimeLinear, significantly improves the performance of a single linear projector, reducing MSE by an average of 23\% on benchmark datasets such as Electricity and Traffic. Notably, TimeLinear achieves these gains while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency, delivering results that are on par with or exceed state-of-the-art models, despite using a fraction of the parameters.</description>

Abstract: Causal discovery is essential across various scientific fields to uncover causal structures within data. Traditional methods relying on observational data have limitations due to confounding variables. This paper presents an optimization-based approach using integer programming (IP) to design minimal intervention sets that ensure causal structure identifiability. Our method provides exact and modular solutions that can be adjusted to different experimental settings and constraints. We demonstrate its effectiveness through comparative analysis across different settings, demonstrating its applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>The Data-Driven Censored Newsvendor Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the decision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage and underage costs based only on censored sales data, rather than historical demand realizations. To isolate the impact of demand censoring on this problem, we adopt a distributionally robust optimization framework, evaluating policies according to their worst-case regret over an ambiguity set of distributions. This set is defined by the largest historical order quantity (the observable boundary of the dataset), and contains all distributions matching the true demand distribution up to this boundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary afterwards. We demonstrate a spectrum of achievability under demand censoring by deriving a natural necessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing regret is an achievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly characterize the information loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower bound on the performance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access to infinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp characterizations to propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the historical level of demand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for this algorithm across all possible censoring regimes, and show its near-optimality with matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We moreover demonstrate its robust performance via extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A framework for bilevel optimization that enables stochastic and global variance reduction algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization, the problem of minimizing a value function which involves the arg-minimum of another function, appears in many areas of machine learning. In a large scale empirical risk minimization setting where the number of samples is huge, it is crucial to develop stochastic methods, which only use a few samples at a time to progress. However, computing the gradient of the value function involves solving a linear system, which makes it difficult to derive unbiased stochastic estimates. To overcome this problem we introduce a novel framework, in which the solution of the inner problem, the solution of the linear system, and the main variable evolve at the same time. These directions are written as a sum, making it straightforward to derive unbiased estimates. The simplicity of our approach allows us to develop global variance reduction algorithms, where the dynamics of all variables is subject to variance reduction. We demonstrate that SABA, an adaptation of the celebrated SAGA algorithm in our framework, has $O(\frac1T)$ convergence rate, and that it achieves linear convergence under Polyak-Lojasciewicz assumption. This is the first stochastic algorithm for bilevel optimization that verifies either of these properties. Numerical experiments validate the usefulness of our method.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound and a Near-Optimal Algorithm for Bilevel Empirical Risk Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08766v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems, which are problems where two optimization problems are nested, have more and more applications in machine learning. In many practical cases, the upper and the lower objectives correspond to empirical risk minimization problems and therefore have a sum structure. In this context, we propose a bilevel extension of the celebrated SARAH algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}((n+m)^{\frac12}\varepsilon^{-1})$ oracle calls to achieve $\varepsilon$-stationarity with $n+m$ the total number of samples, which improves over all previous bilevel algorithms. Moreover, we provide a lower bound on the number of oracle calls required to get an approximate stationary point of the objective function of the bilevel problem. This lower bound is attained by our algorithm, making it optimal in terms of sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Skew-Probabilistic Neural Networks for Learning from Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit imbalanced data distribution, where certain class levels are severely underrepresented. In such cases, traditional pattern classifiers have shown a bias towards the majority class, impeding accurate predictions for the minority class. This paper introduces an imbalanced data-oriented classifier using probabilistic neural networks (PNN) with a skew-normal kernel function to address this major challenge. PNN is known for providing probabilistic outputs, enabling quantification of prediction confidence, interpretability, and the ability to handle limited data. By leveraging the skew-normal distribution, which offers increased flexibility, particularly for imbalanced and non-symmetric data, our proposed Skew-Probabilistic Neural Networks (SkewPNN) can better represent underlying class densities. Hyperparameter fine-tuning is imperative to optimize the performance of the proposed approach on imbalanced datasets. To this end, we employ a population-based heuristic algorithm, the Bat optimization algorithm, to explore the hyperparameter space effectively. We also prove the statistical consistency of the density estimates, suggesting that the true distribution will be approached smoothly as the sample size increases. Theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed SkewPNN and BA-SkewPNN is also provided. Numerical simulations have been conducted on different synthetic datasets, comparing various benchmark-imbalanced learners. Real-data analysis on several datasets shows that SkewPNN and BA-SkewPNN substantially outperform most state-of-the-art machine-learning methods for both balanced and imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class categories) in most experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Provably Scalable Black-Box Variational Inference with Structured Variational Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known not to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have established that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the dimensionality of the problem compared to e.g. mean-field families. This is particularly critical to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables; their dimensionality increases with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one gets an iteration complexity with an explicit $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dependence on the dataset size $N$. In this paper, we explore a theoretical middle ground between mean-field variational families and full-rank families: structured variational families. We rigorously prove that certain scale matrix structures can achieve a better iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, implying better scaling with respect to $N$. We empirically verify our theoretical results on large-scale hierarchical models.</description>

      <title>Discovering group dynamics in coordinated time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of spatiotemporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for analyzing non-asymptotic guarantees of numerical discretizations of ergodic SDEs in Wasserstein-2 distance is presented by Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis in ``Wasserstein distance estimates for the distributions of numerical approximations to ergodic stochastic differential equations". They analyze the UBU integrator which is strong order two and only requires one gradient evaluation per step, resulting in desirable non-asymptotic guarantees, in particular $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-1/2})$ steps to reach a distance of $\epsilon &gt; 0$ in Wasserstein-2 distance away from the target distribution. However, there is a mistake in the local error estimates in Sanz-Serna and Zygalakis (2021), in particular, a stronger assumption is needed to achieve these complexity estimates. This note reconciles the theory with the dimension dependence observed in practice in many applications of interest.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Hessian Fittings with Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report studies the fitting of Hessian or its inverse for stochastic optimizations using a Hessian fitting criterion from the preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) method, which is intimately related to many commonly used second-order and adaptive gradient optimizers, e.g., BFGS, Gaussian-Newton algorithm, natural gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc. Our analyses reveal the efficiency and reliability differences among a wide range of preconditioner fitting methods, from closed-form to iterative solutions, using Hessian-vector products or stochastic gradients only, with Hessian fittings in the Euclidean space, the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPL) matrices, to a variety of Lie groups. The most intriguing discovery is that the Hessian fitting itself as an optimization problem is strongly convex under mild conditions in certain general Lie groups. This discovery turns Hessian fitting into a well-behaved Lie group optimization problem and facilitates the designs of highly efficient and elegant Lie group sparse preconditioner fitting methods for large-scale stochastic optimizations.</description>

Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <title>Alternators For Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and often outperform strong baselines such as Mambas, neural ODEs, and diffusion models in the domains we studied.</description>

Abstract: Regression trees have emerged as a preeminent tool for solving real-world regression problems due to their ability to deal with nonlinearities, interaction effects and sharp discontinuities. In this article, we rather study regression trees applied to well-behaved, differentiable functions, and determine the relationship between node parameters and the local gradient of the function being approximated. We find a simple estimate of the gradient which can be efficiently computed using quantities exposed by popular tree learning libraries. This allows the tools developed in the context of differentiable algorithms, like neural nets and Gaussian processes, to be deployed to tree-based models. To demonstrate this, we study measures of model sensitivity defined in terms of integrals of gradients and demonstrate how to compute them for regression trees using the proposed gradient estimates. Quantitative and qualitative numerical experiments reveal the capability of gradients estimated by regression trees to improve predictive analysis, solve tasks in uncertainty quantification, and provide interpretation of model behavior.</description>

      <title>Multi-Normal Prototypes Learning for Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains. Most of the existing methods assume the normal sample data clusters around a single central prototype while the real data may consist of multiple categories or subgroups. In addition, existing methods always assume all unlabeled samples are normal while some of them are inevitably being anomalies. To address these issues, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that can efficiently work with limited labeled anomalies. Specifically, we assume the normal sample data may consist of multiple subgroups, and propose to learn multi-normal prototypes to represent them with deep embedding clustering and contrastive learning. Additionally, we propose a method to estimate the likelihood of each unlabeled sample being normal during model training, which can help to learn more efficient data encoder and normal prototypes for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Counterfactual Distributions via Kernel Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a setting with multiple units (e.g., individuals, cohorts, geographic locations) and outcomes (e.g., treatments, times, items), where the goal is to learn a multivariate distribution for each unit-outcome entry, such as the distribution of a user's weekly spend and engagement under a specific mobile app version. A common challenge is the prevalence of missing not at random data, where observations are available only for certain unit-outcome combinations and the observation availability can be correlated with the properties of distributions themselves, i.e., there is unobserved confounding. An additional challenge is that for any observed unit-outcome entry, we only have a finite number of samples from the underlying distribution. We tackle these two challenges by casting the problem into a novel distributional matrix completion framework and introduce a kernel based distributional generalization of nearest neighbors to estimate the underlying distributions. By leveraging maximum mean discrepancies and a suitable factor model on the kernel mean embeddings of the underlying distributions, we establish consistent recovery of the underlying distributions even when data is missing not at random and positivity constraints are violated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our nearest neighbors approach is robust to heteroscedastic noise, provided we have access to two or more measurements for the observed unit-outcome entries, a robustness not present in prior works on nearest neighbors with single measurements.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis on Policy-Augmented Graphical Hybrid Models with Shapley Value Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the critical challenges in biomanufacturing, including high complexity and high uncertainty, we propose a comprehensive and computationally efficient sensitivity analysis framework for general nonlinear policy-augmented knowledge graphical (pKG) hybrid models that characterize the risk- and science-based understandings of underlying stochastic decision process mechanisms. The criticality of each input (i.e., random factors, policy parameters, and model parameters) is measured by applying Shapley value (SV) sensitivity analysis to pKG (called SV-pKG), accounting for process causal interdependences. To quickly assess the SV for heavily instrumented bioprocesses, we approximate their dynamics with linear Gaussian pKG models and improve the SV estimation efficiency by utilizing the linear Gaussian properties. In addition, we propose an effective permutation sampling method with TFWW transformation and variance reduction techniques, namely the quasi-Monte Carlo and antithetic sampling methods, to further improve the sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy of SV for both general nonlinear and linear Gaussian pKG models. Our proposed framework can benefit efficient interpretation and support stable optimal process control in biomanufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation for sparse learners is to compress the inputs (features) by selecting only the ones needed for good generalization. Linear models with LASSO-type regularization achieve this by setting the weights of irrelevant features to zero, effectively identifying and ignoring them. In artificial neural networks, this selective focus can be achieved by pruning the input layer. Given a cost function enhanced with a sparsity-promoting penalty, our proposal selects a regularization term $\lambda$ (without the use of cross-validation or a validation set) that creates a local minimum in the cost function at the origin where no features are selected. This local minimum acts as a baseline, meaning that if there is no strong enough signal to justify a feature inclusion, the local minimum remains at zero with a high prescribed probability. The method is flexible, applying to complex models ranging from shallow to deep artificial neural networks and supporting various cost functions and sparsity-promoting penalties. We empirically show a remarkable phase transition in the probability of retrieving the relevant features, as well as good generalization thanks to the choice of $\lambda$, the non-convex penalty and the optimization scheme developed. This approach can be seen as a form of compressed sensing for complex models, allowing us to distill high-dimensional data into a compact, interpretable subset of meaningful features.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Unified Skew-Normal Process with Neural Bayes Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial data that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and heavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail weight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture the intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the Gaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the popularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that govern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature, unified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have received considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and intepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the distribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal (GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate that the GSUN is a valid spatial process by showing its vanishing correlation in large distances and provide the corresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an inference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes estimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder transformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the conventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means of a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data. Furthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional Gaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability integral transform (PIT).</description>

      <title>Noisy Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition with Sparse Factors and Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for extracting physically meaningful latent factors from multi-dimensional nonnegative data, and has been an increasing interest in a variety of fields such as image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. In this paper, we propose a sparse nonnegative Tucker decomposition and completion method for the recovery of underlying nonnegative data under noisy observations. Here the underlying nonnegative data tensor is decomposed into a core tensor and several factor matrices with all entries being nonnegative and the factor matrices being sparse. The loss function is derived by the maximum likelihood estimation of the noisy observations, and the $\ell_0$ norm is employed to enhance the sparsity of the factor matrices. We establish the error bound of the estimator of the proposed model under generic noise scenarios, which is then specified to the observations with additive Gaussian noise, additive Laplace noise, and Poisson observations, respectively. Our theoretical results are better than those by existing tensor-based or matrix-based methods. Moreover, the minimax lower bounds are shown to be matched with the derived upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. Numerical examples on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for nonnegative tensor data completion.</description>

      <title>Environment Invariant Linear Least Squares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a multi-environment linear regression model in which data from multiple experimental settings are collected. The joint distribution of the response variable and covariates may vary across different environments, yet the conditional expectations of $y$ given the unknown set of important variables are invariant. Such a statistical model is related to the problem of endogeneity, causal inference, and transfer learning. The motivation behind it is illustrated by how the goals of prediction and attribution are inherent in estimating the true parameter and the important variable set. We construct a novel environment invariant linear least squares (EILLS) objective function, a multi-environment version of linear least-squares regression that leverages the above conditional expectation invariance structure and heterogeneity among different environments to determine the true parameter. Our proposed method is applicable without any additional structural knowledge and can identify the true parameter under a near-minimal identification condition. We establish non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ error bounds on the estimation error for the EILLS estimator in the presence of spurious variables. Moreover, we further show that the $\ell_0$ penalized EILLS estimator can achieve variable selection consistency in high-dimensional regimes. These non-asymptotic results demonstrate the sample efficiency of the EILLS estimator and its capability to circumvent the curse of endogeneity in an algorithmic manner without any prior structural knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to realize statistically efficient invariance learning in the general linear model.</description>

Abstract: Current defense mechanisms against model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) systems have proven effective up to a certain threshold of malicious clients. In this work, we introduce FLANDERS, a novel pre-aggregation filter for FL resilient to large-scale model poisoning attacks, i.e., when malicious clients far exceed legitimate participants. FLANDERS treats the sequence of local models sent by clients in each FL round as a matrix-valued time series. Then, it identifies malicious client updates as outliers in this time series by comparing actual observations with estimates generated by a matrix autoregressive forecasting model maintained by the server. Experiments conducted in several non-iid FL setups show that FLANDERS significantly improves robustness across a wide spectrum of attacks when paired with standard and robust existing aggregation methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new framework, called "RYU" for constructing "safe" regions -- specifically, bounded sets that are guaranteed to contain the dual solution of a target optimization problem. Our framework applies to the standard case where the objective function is composed of two components: a closed, proper, convex function with Lipschitz-smooth gradient and another closed, proper, convex function. We show that the RYU framework not only encompasses but also improves upon the state-of-the-art methods proposed over the past decade for this class of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Partially factorized variational inference for high-dimensional mixed models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While generalized linear mixed models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics, many specifications, such as those involving categorical factors with many levels or interaction terms, can be computationally challenging to estimate due to the need to compute or approximate high-dimensional integrals. Variational inference is a popular way to perform such computations, especially in the Bayesian context. However, naive use of such methods can provide unreliable uncertainty quantification. We show that this is indeed the case for mixed models, proving that standard mean-field variational inference dramatically underestimates posterior uncertainty in high-dimensions. We then show how appropriately relaxing the mean-field assumption leads to methods whose uncertainty quantification does not deteriorate in high-dimensions, and whose total computational cost scales linearly with the number of parameters and observations. Our theoretical and numerical results focus on mixed models with Gaussian or binomial likelihoods, and rely on connections to random graph theory to obtain sharp high-dimensional asymptotic analysis. We also provide generic results, which are of independent interest, relating the accuracy of variational inference to the convergence rate of the corresponding coordinate ascent algorithm that is used to find it. Our proposed methodology is implemented in the R package, see https://github.com/mgoplerud/vglmer . Numerical results with simulated and real data examples illustrate the favourable computation cost versus accuracy trade-off of our approach compared to various alternatives.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification on Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of uncertainty quantification is increasingly recognized in the diverse field of machine learning. Accurately assessing model prediction uncertainty can help provide deeper understanding and confidence for researchers and practitioners. This is especially critical in medical diagnosis and drug discovery areas, where reliable predictions directly impact research quality and patient health.
  In this paper, we proposed incorporating uncertainty quantification into clinical trial outcome predictions. Our main goal is to enhance the model's ability to discern nuanced differences, thereby significantly improving its overall performance.
  We have adopted a selective classification approach to fulfill our objective, integrating it seamlessly with the Hierarchical Interaction Network (HINT), which is at the forefront of clinical trial prediction modeling. Selective classification, encompassing a spectrum of methods for uncertainty quantification, empowers the model to withhold decision-making in the face of samples marked by ambiguity or low confidence, thereby amplifying the accuracy of predictions for the instances it chooses to classify. A series of comprehensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating selective classification into clinical trial predictions markedly enhances the model's performance, as evidenced by significant upticks in pivotal metrics such as PR-AUC, F1, ROC-AUC, and overall accuracy.
  Specifically, the proposed method achieved 32.37\%, 21.43\%, and 13.27\% relative improvement on PR-AUC over the base model (HINT) in phase I, II, and III trial outcome prediction, respectively. When predicting phase III, our method reaches 0.9022 PR-AUC scores.
  These findings illustrate the robustness and prospective utility of this strategy within the area of clinical trial predictions, potentially setting a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Approach to Machine Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To comply with AI and data regulations, the need to forget private or copyrighted information from trained machine learning models is increasingly important. The key challenge in unlearning is forgetting the necessary data in a timely manner, while preserving model performance. In this work, we address the zero-shot unlearning scenario, whereby an unlearning algorithm must be able to remove data given only a trained model and the data to be forgotten. We explore unlearning from an information theoretic perspective, connecting the influence of a sample to the information gain a model receives by observing it. From this, we derive a simple but principled zero-shot unlearning method based on the geometry of the model. Our approach takes the form of minimising the gradient of a learned function with respect to a small neighbourhood around a target forget point. This induces a smoothing effect, causing forgetting by moving the boundary of the classifier. We explore the intuition behind why this approach can jointly unlearn forget samples while preserving general model performance through a series of low-dimensional experiments. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of our method over a range of contemporary benchmarks, verifying that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art performance under the strict constraints of zero-shot unlearning.

      <title>A Statistical Framework of Watermarks for Large Language Models: Pivot, Detection Efficiency and Optimal Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Frequency Estimation Under Local Differential Privacy With an Adaptive Randomized Response Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency estimation plays a critical role in many applications involving personal and private categorical data. Such data are often collected sequentially over time, making it valuable to estimate their distribution online while preserving privacy. We propose AdOBEst-LDP, a new algorithm for adaptive, online Bayesian estimation of categorical distributions under local differential privacy (LDP). The key idea behind AdOBEst-LDP is to enhance the utility of future privatized categorical data by leveraging inference from previously collected privatized data. To achieve this, AdOBEst-LDP uses a new adaptive LDP mechanism to collect privatized data. This LDP mechanism constrains its output to a \emph{subset} of categories that `predicts' the next user's data. By adapting the subset selection process to the past privatized data via Bayesian estimation, the algorithm improves the utility of future privatized data. To quantify utility, we explore various well-known information metrics, including (but not limited to) the Fisher information matrix, total variation distance, and information entropy. For Bayesian estimation, we utilize \emph{posterior sampling} through stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, a computationally efficient approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
  We provide a theoretical analysis showing that (i) the posterior distribution of the category probabilities targeted with Bayesian estimation converges to the true probabilities even for approximate posterior sampling, and (ii) AdOBEst-LDP eventually selects the optimal subset for its LDP mechanism with high probability if posterior sampling is performed exactly. We also present numerical results to validate the estimation accuracy of AdOBEst-LDP. Our comparisons show its superior performance against non-adaptive and semi-adaptive competitors across different privacy levels and distributional parameters.</description>

      <title>Unified Universality Theorem for Deep and Shallow Joint-Group-Equivariant Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a constructive universal approximation theorem for learning machines equipped with joint-group-equivariant feature maps, called the joint-equivariant machines, based on the group representation theory. "Constructive" here indicates that the distribution of parameters is given in a closed-form expression known as the ridgelet transform. Joint-group-equivariance encompasses a broad class of feature maps that generalize classical group-equivariance. Particularly, fully-connected networks are not group-equivariant but are joint-group-equivariant. Our main theorem also unifies the universal approximation theorems for both shallow and deep networks. Until this study, the universality of deep networks has been shown in a different manner from the universality of shallow networks, but our results discuss them on common ground. Now we can understand the approximation schemes of various learning machines in a unified manner. As applications, we show the constructive universal approximation properties of four examples: depth-$n$ joint-equivariant machine, depth-$n$ fully-connected network, depth-$n$ group-convolutional network, and a new depth-$2$ network with quadratic forms whose universality has not been known.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Adaptive Calibration and Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of calibrating computer models of natural phenomena is essential for applications in the physical sciences, where plenty of domain knowledge can be embedded into simulations and then calibrated against real observations. Current machine learning approaches, however, mostly rely on rerunning simulations over a fixed set of designs available in the observed data, potentially neglecting informative correlations across the design space and requiring a large amount of simulations. Instead, we consider the calibration process from the perspective of Bayesian adaptive experimental design and propose a data-efficient algorithm to run maximally informative simulations within a batch-sequential process. At each round, the algorithm jointly estimates the parameters of the posterior distribution and optimal designs by maximising a variational lower bound of the expected information gain. The simulator is modelled as a sample from a Gaussian process, which allows us to correlate simulations and observed data with the unknown calibration parameters. We show the benefits of our method when compared to related approaches across synthetic and real-data problems.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Landscape of Replicable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study computational aspects of algorithmic replicability, a notion of stability introduced by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell [2022]. Motivated by a recent line of work that established strong statistical connections between replicability and other notions of learnability such as online learning, private learning, and SQ learning, we aim to understand better the computational connections between replicability and these learning paradigms. Our first result shows that there is a concept class that is efficiently replicably PAC learnable, but, under standard cryptographic assumptions, no efficient online learner exists for this class. Subsequently, we design an efficient replicable learner for PAC learning parities when the marginal distribution is far from uniform, making progress on a question posed by Impagliazzo et al. [2022]. To obtain this result, we design a replicable lifting framework inspired by Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan [2023] that transforms in a black-box manner efficient replicable PAC learners under the uniform marginal distribution over the Boolean hypercube to replicable PAC learners under any marginal distribution, with sample and time complexity that depends on a certain measure of the complexity of the distribution. Finally, we show that any pure DP learner can be transformed to a replicable one in time polynomial in the accuracy, confidence parameters and exponential in the representation dimension of the underlying hypothesis class.</description>

      <title>Ranking by Lifts: A Cost-Benefit Approach to Large-Scale A/B Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A/B testers that conduct large-scale tests often prioritize lifts as the main outcome metric and want to be able to control costs resulting from false rejections of the null. This work develops a decision-theoretic framework for maximizing profits subject to false discovery rate (FDR) control. We build an empirical Bayes solution for the problem via a greedy knapsack approach. We derive an oracle rule based on ranking the ratio of expected lifts and the cost of wrong rejections using the local false discovery rate (lfdr) statistic. Our oracle decision rule is valid and optimal for large-scale tests. Further, we establish asymptotic validity for the data-driven procedure and demonstrate finite-sample validity in experimental studies. We also demonstrate the merit of the proposed method over other FDR control methods. Finally, we discuss an application to data collected by experiments on the Optimizely platform.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Trees for Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05593v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite much work on advanced deep learning and generative modeling techniques for tabular data generation and imputation, traditional methods have continued to win on imputation benchmarks. We herein present UnmaskingTrees, a simple method for tabular imputation (and generation) employing gradient-boosted decision trees which are used to incrementally unmask individual features. This approach offers state-of-the-art performance on imputation, and on generation given training data with missingness; and it has competitive performance on vanilla generation. To solve the conditional generation subproblem, we propose a tabular probabilistic prediction method, BaltoBot, which fits a balanced tree of boosted tree classifiers. Unlike older methods, it requires no parametric assumption on the conditional distribution, accommodating features with multimodal distributions; unlike newer diffusion methods, it offers fast sampling, closed-form density estimation, and flexible handling of discrete variables. We finally consider our two approaches as meta-algorithms, demonstrating in-context learning-based generative modeling with TabPFN.</description>

      <title>Is Behavior Cloning All You Need? Understanding Horizon in Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to mimic the behavior of an expert in a sequential decision making task by learning from demonstrations, and has been widely applied to robotics, autonomous driving, and autoregressive text generation. The simplest approach to IL, behavior cloning (BC), is thought to incur sample complexity with unfavorable quadratic dependence on the problem horizon, motivating a variety of different online algorithms that attain improved linear horizon dependence under stronger assumptions on the data and the learner's access to the expert.
  We revisit the apparent gap between offline and online IL from a learning-theoretic perspective, with a focus on the realizable/well-specified setting with general policy classes up to and including deep neural networks. Through a new analysis of behavior cloning with the logarithmic loss, we show that it is possible to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity in offline IL whenever (i) the range of the cumulative payoffs is controlled, and (ii) an appropriate notion of supervised learning complexity for the policy class is controlled. Specializing our results to deterministic, stationary policies, we show that the gap between offline and online IL is smaller than previously thought: (i) it is possible to achieve linear dependence on horizon in offline IL under dense rewards (matching what was previously only known to be achievable in online IL); and (ii) without further assumptions on the policy class, online IL cannot improve over offline IL with the logarithmic loss, even in benign MDPs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard RL tasks and autoregressive language generation to validate the practical relevance of our findings.</description>

      <title>Solving Video Inverse Problems Using Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have emerged as state-of-the-art approaches for addressing inverse problems, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. However, their application to video inverse problems arising from spatio-temporal degradation remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training video diffusion models. To address this issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages only image diffusion models. Specifically, by drawing inspiration from the success of the recent decomposed diffusion sampler (DDS), our method treats the time dimension of a video as the batch dimension of image diffusion models and solves spatio-temporal optimization problems within denoised spatio-temporal batches derived from each image diffusion model. Moreover, we introduce a batch-consistent diffusion sampling strategy that encourages consistency across batches by synchronizing the stochastic noise components in image diffusion models. Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with simultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse diffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy for video inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses various spatio-temporal degradations in video inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions.

      <description>arXiv:2409.11141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite sample perspective on the problem of identifying an LTI system from a finite set of possible systems using trajectory data. To this end, we use the maximum likelihood estimator to identify the true system and provide an upper bound for its sample complexity. Crucially, the derived bound does not rely on a potentially restrictive stability assumption. Additionally, we leverage tools from information theory to provide a lower bound to the sample complexity that holds independently of the used estimator. The derived sample complexity bounds are analyzed analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Interval Estimation of Coefficients in Penalized Regression Models of Insurance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tweedie exponential dispersion family is a popular choice among many to model insurance losses that consist of zero-inflated semicontinuous data. In such data, it is often important to obtain credibility (inference) of the most important features that describe the endogenous variables. Post-selection inference is the standard procedure in statistics to obtain confidence intervals of model parameters after performing a feature extraction procedure. For a linear model, the lasso estimate often has non-negligible estimation bias for large coefficients corresponding to exogenous variables. To have valid inference on those coefficients, it is necessary to correct the bias of the lasso estimate. Traditional statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing or standard confidence interval construction might lead to incorrect conclusions during post-selection, as they are generally too optimistic. Here we discuss a few methodologies for constructing confidence intervals of the coefficients after feature selection in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family with application to insurance data.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient for Rectangular Matrix Factorization and Linear Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization, which is a canonical nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, given a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, we prove that gradient descent (GD) can find a pair of $\epsilon$-optimal solutions $\mathbf{X}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $d\geq r$, satisfying $\lVert\mathbf{X}_T\mathbf{Y}_T^\top-\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}\leq\epsilon\lVert\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}$ in $T=O(\kappa^2\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations with high probability, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) attains an iteration complexity of $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is the best-known bound of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization. Different from small balanced random initialization in the existing literature, we adopt an unbalanced initialization, where $\mathbf{X}_0$ is large and $\mathbf{Y}_0$ is $0$. Moreover, our initialization and analysis can be further extended to linear neural networks, where we prove that NAG can also attain an accelerated linear convergence rate. In particular, we only require the width of the network to be greater than or equal to the rank of the output label matrix. In contrast, previous results achieving the same rate require excessive widths that additionally depend on the condition number and the rank of the input data matrix.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to our geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. By tailoring the geometric flow in which the latent space evolves, we induce latent geometric properties of our choosing, which are reflected in empirical performance. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform this and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times. We provide empirical justification towards how we can improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Tree-Wasserstein Distance for High Dimensional Data with a Latent Feature Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding meaningful distances between high-dimensional data samples is an important scientific task. To this end, we propose a new tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD) for high-dimensional data with two key aspects. First, our TWD is specifically designed for data with a latent feature hierarchy, i.e., the features lie in a hierarchical space, in contrast to the usual focus on embedding samples in hyperbolic space. Second, while the conventional use of TWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its inherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy. The key idea of our method is to embed the features into a multi-scale hyperbolic space using diffusion geometry and then present a new tree decoding method by establishing analogies between the hyperbolic embedding and trees. We show that our TWD computed based on data observations provably recovers the TWD defined with the latent feature hierarchy and that its computation is efficient and scalable. We showcase the usefulness of the proposed TWD in applications to word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, demonstrating its advantages over existing TWDs and methods based on pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>A Note on Doubly Robust Estimator in Regression Continuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</description>

      <title>Supervised Autoencoders with Fractionally Differentiated Features and Triple Barrier Labelling Enhance Predictions on Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of financial time series forecasting with the use of neural networks through supervised autoencoders (SAE), to improve investment strategy performance. Using the Sharpe and Information Ratios, it specifically examines the impact of noise augmentation and triple barrier labeling on risk-adjusted returns. The study focuses on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum as the traded assets from January 1, 2016, to April 30, 2022. Findings indicate that supervised autoencoders, with balanced noise augmentation and bottleneck size, significantly boost strategy effectiveness. However, excessive noise and large bottleneck sizes can impair performance.</description>

      <title>CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Geometrical and Topological Complexity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</description>
