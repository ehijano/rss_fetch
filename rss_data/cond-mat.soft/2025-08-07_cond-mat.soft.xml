      <title>MHD Macroscopic ball analysis: An Open Toolkit for Analyzing Magnetic Particle Rotation in Viscous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents MHD_Macroscopic_ball_analysis, an open-source Python toolkit developed to study the rotational dynamics of magnetized spherical particles immersed in viscous media under externally applied rotating magnetic fields. The toolkit extracts the orientation of the magnetic moment from grayscale video frames using image processing and enables detailed comparisons with synchronized magnetic field vector data. We outline the motivation, core algorithms, implementation, and validation of the toolkit in the context of macroscopic experiments simulating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) particle behavior.

      <title>Suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids remain liquids in overcrowded conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrated suspensions of small ultra-soft colloids (ultra-low crosslinked microgels) are investigated with scattering and steady shear rheology to capture their equilibrium dynamics. The suspensions lack dynamic arrest, although the slow relaxation time $\tau_2$ follows exponential growth with increasing generalized packing fraction, $\zeta$. The zero-shear viscosity grows weakly with $\zeta$, and never diverges in contrast to other soft glass formers, e.g.~star-polymers, microgels, green particles. Their high compressibility allows these ultra-soft spheres to diffuse even in overcrowded environments.</description>

      <title>Thermoresponsive copolymer microgels synthesized via single-step precipitation polymerization: random or block structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner structure of polymeric particles critically influences their phase behavior and functionality, governing their mechanical properties and their physical and chemical interactions. For thermoresponsive microgels, i.e. colloidal particles comprising a crosslinked polymer network that undergo a volume transition upon temperature changes, structural control is key to tailor the material responsivity and broaden the range of applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the internal structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-isopropylmethacrylamide), P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM), copolymer microgels, combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements with multi-scale simulations. By synthesizing different samples, we probe the microgels swelling behavior, revealing distinct signatures of the individual polymers. To elucidate their internal distribution, we perform monomer-resolved microgel simulations across different copolymer models. A direct comparison between experimental and numerical form factors under different, neutron-selective conditions provides evidence of a preferential organization into block structures rather than a random arrangement. These results are confirmed by 13C-NMR which reveals the clear presence of NIPAM blocks within a more random arrangement of the remaining monomers and by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on copolymer chains, which also shed light on a possible origin in the dependence of the hydrogen bonding capability on the local environment. These findings provide a detailed microscopic picture of the inner architecture of P(NIPAM-co-NIPMAM) microgels, revealing an unexpected structural organization that may be generalized to other copolymer systems and could be promising to tailor microgel design and enhance control of material responsivity.</description>

      <title>Sterol-induced raftlike domains in a model lipid monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional system consisting a mixture of higly coarse-grained saturated (S-type), unsaturated (U-type) lipid molecules, and cholesterol (C-type) molecules is considered to form a model lipid monolayer. All the S-, U- and C-type particles are spherical in shape, with distinct interaction strengths. The phase behavior of the system is studied for various compositions ($x$) of the C-type particles, ranging from $x = 0.1$ to $0.9$. The results show that a structurally ordered complex is formed with the S- and C-types in the fluid-like environment of U-type particles, for $x \in \lbrace 0.5 - 0.6\rbrace$. The time-averaged hexatic order parameter $\left\langle \Psi_{6} \right\rangle$ indicates that the dynamical segregation of S- and C-types exhibits a positional order, that is found to be maximum for $x$ in the range of 0.5 - 0.6. The mean change in the free energy ($\Delta G(x)$) obtained from the mean change in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and entropy ($\Delta S$) calculations suggests that $\Delta G$ is minimum for $x \sim 0.6$. A phenomenological expression for the Gibbs free energy is formulated by explicitly accounting for the individual free energies of S-,U- and C-type particles and the mutual interactions between them. Minimizing this phenomenological $G$ with respect to the C-type composition results in the optimal value, $x^* = 0.564 \pm 0.001$ for stable coexistence of phases; consistent with the simulation results and also the previous experimental observations \cite{raghavendra_effect_2023}. All these observations signifies the optimal C-type composition, $x \sim 0.5 - 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a three-dimensional mesoscale odd fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd fluids are a class of fluids characterized by non-zero antisymmetric transport coefficient tensors induced by broken time-reversal symmetry. In our previous work, a mesoscale simulation model for two-dimensional isotropic odd fluids was developed. Here, we extend the model to the three-dimensional case that corresponds to an anisotropic odd fluid with cylindrical symmetry. Using kinetic theory, we analytically derive the viscosity tensor and Navier-Stokes equation for the three-dimensional mesoscale odd fluid, which are quantitatively verified by simulations. Furthermore, through both simulation and hydrodynamic theory, we demonstrate that the planar Poiseuille flow of the three-dimensional odd fluid exhibits exotic transport behavior. This work thus paves the way for performing large-scale simulations to explore and exploit intriguing phenomena of odd fluids.</description>

      <title>Active Extensile Hydrogels Actuated by Living Polymers of the Bacterial Cytokinetic Protein FtsZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active materials capable of autonomously modulating their mechanical properties are foundational to the development of next-generation soft technologies. Here, we introduce a novel class of extensible biohybrid hydrogels powered by living polymers of the bacterial cytokinetic protein FtsZ. When embedded within a polyacrylamide (PA) matrix, GTP-fueled FtsZ filaments self-organize into treadmilling structures that generate internal extensible stresses, driving reversible softening, swelling, and fluidization of the composite FtsZ-PA hydrogel network. Unlike conventional contractile biopolymer systems, these hybrid gels exhibit stress-induced softening, yield under minimal deformation, and suppress thermal flow barriers-hallmarks of dissipative, extensile metamaterials. Microscopic particle tracking reveals active non-Gaussian fluctuations, while bulk rheology confirms programmable, concentration-dependent reductions in both stiffness and viscosity. Theoretical modeling shows that internal filament activity gives rise to a negative mechanical permittivity, establishing a new paradigm in materials science in which embedded FtsZ living polymers dynamically program active matter mechanics from within. These findings open new avenues for the design of modular, reconfigurable systems in adaptive biomaterials, soft robotics, and synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Emergence of run-and-tumble-like swimming in self-propelling artificial swimmers in soft microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological microswimmers often encounter deformable boundaries in physiological conditions; for instance, the viscoelastic walls of reproductive tract during migration of spermatozoa, or host tissue during early bacterial biofilm formation. However, the combined influence of elastic and hydrodynamic cues on microswimmer dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally investigate how the softness of microchannel walls affects the swimming characteristics of self-propelling microswimmers, using autophoretic active droplets as a model system. Remarkably, in a soft microchannel, a self-propelling droplet exhibits a run-and-tumble-like motility characterized by abrupt reorientations in the swimming direction, which are accompanied by local reduction and subsequent increase in the swimming speed. Such emergent swimming dynamics in response to increasing softness of microchannels have been previously unobserved for synthetic microswimmers. Using 3D boundary integral simulations and fluorescence microscopy experiments, we show that the coupling between the elastohydrodynamic interactions and the chemo-hydrodynamics, inherent in the self-propulsion mechanism, in a soft narrow confinement results in alterations in the swimming characteristics. We envisage that such adaptation of autophoretic microswimmers to changes in the softness of microchannel walls will pave the way for novel methods for tuning active agents in complex environment solely by exploiting the elasticity of confining walls.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Moisture-driven CO2 direct air capture and delivery for cultivating cyanobacteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture system was developed and demonstrated for cultivating cyanobacteria and microalgae at the flask (50 mL), bench (12 L) and small pilot (840 L) scale. Purolite A501 anion exchange resin beads were found to be biocompatible and rapidly deliver air-captured CO2 when immersed directly in an alkaline cultivation medium containing cyanobacteria or microalgae. Flask-scale cultivation trials showed A501 could sustain rapid growth (190 mg/L/d) of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain engineered to produce laurate. A bench-scale system installed in a laminar flow hood was able to deliver 2 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium and 0.5 g/d in the presence of Synechocystis to support vigorous growth (39 mg/L/d) limited by the CO2 delivered by the sorbent. A small pilot-scale system installed in a 4.2 m2 outdoor raceway pond in Mesa, Arizona was able to deliver 100 g CO2/d into abiotic alkaline cultivation medium. Exopolysaccharides and other products excreted by Synechocystis 6803 covered the sorbent beads, reducing their capacity to 25%, which could be partially restored to 70% capacity using a wash protocol, but the CO2 delivery kinetics remained 3-4 fold slower. Analysis of the sorbent beads used as part of four separate outdoor cultivation trials with over 300 days of outdoor wet and dry cycling over four seasons showed significant mechanical fracturing. Infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed a significant loss of NR4+ functional groups necessary for CO2 capture correlated with extended use. Under the assumption that abiotic performance eventually can be retained by delivering CO2 into the media recycle stream in a way that avoids biofouling, technoeconomic and life cycle analyses show the viability of a small first-of-a-kind biorefinery producing 500 barrels per day of biofuel.</description>

      <title>A unified model for linear responses of physical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical systems--from mechanical lattices and electrical circuits to biological tissues and architected metamaterials--can be understood as networks transmitting physical quantities. We present a unified mathematical framework for describing linear responses of such physical networks using tools from algebraic graph theory. This approach captures static and dynamic behaviors across multiple domains, including mechanical, electrical, thermal, and diffusive responses using node and edge variables (e.g., potentials, flows). Our formalism connects multiscale and multi-domain responses to the underlying network structure. We demonstrate how this framework enables efficient, generalizable solutions to a wide class of linear response problems, including stress propagation, charge transport, and wave dynamics, and provide insights into network duality and entropy production.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics and First-Passage Properties of Stochastic Processes: From Brownian Motion to Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions", we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process, which we explicitly construct.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>

Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheatham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient large-scale computer simulations of aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the complexity of these systems evidences the difficulties in describing solution properties without due account of polarization. Different strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of solvated ions. In this work, we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized to predict the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally well, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, but also surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe densities of NaCl solutions for models parametrized to their crystal and melt properties only. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and show that a robust parametrization can be achieved without invoking the concept of charge scaling.</description>

Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.</description>
