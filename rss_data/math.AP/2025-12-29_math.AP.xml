      <title>On general Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities involving non-doubling weights in the case of $p=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities in the case of $p=1$ and generalize them adopting weight functions
  $w(|x|)$ on $R^n$ with $w(t)$ in ${W}(R_+)$. Here ${W}(R_+)$ is a general class of weight functions on $R_+$ including non-doubling weights like $e^{1/t}$ and $e^{-1/t}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Explicit Patterns: Exact Steady States and Stability in a Confined Chemotaxis Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Carrillo-Li-Wang's work [Proc. London Math. Soc., 2021] on stationary solutions to the singular Keller-Segel system, this paper presents a novel family of explicit steady-state solutions for the same model on a bounded interval, expressed in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions and within a biologically stable parameter regime, these solutions, including singular types such as secant and cosecant, are rigorously derived and analyzed. Their stability is established via energy methods, yielding precise thresholds for pattern persistence. These results provide valuable benchmarks for numerical validation and offer insights into boundary-driven pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Existence of global solutions to the Fokas-Lenells equation with arbitrary spectral singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of solutions to the Fokas-Lenells equation for any initial data in a weighted Sobolev space $H^{3}(\mathbb{R})\cap H^{2,1}(\mathbb{R})$.This result removes all spectral restrictions on the initial data required in our previous work.
  The proof primarily relies on the inverse scattering transform formulated as new Riemann-Hilbert problems and Zhou's $L^{2}$-Sobolev bijectivity theory.</description>

      <title>Shock Formation for Compressible Euler Equations on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the finite-time shock formation for the compressible Euler equations on the two-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. In contrast to the flat Euclidean case $\mathbb{R}^2$, the geometry of $\mathbb S^2$ imposes new difficulties, and the fluid dynamics are affected by the curved background. To overcome these challenges, we modify the existing modulation method and employ a set of carefully constructed, time-dependent coordinates that precisely track the shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$. In particular, we first perform a time-dependent rotation of $\mathbb S^2$, then apply the stereographic projection to the sphere, straighten the steepening shock front, and finally construct shock-adapted coordinates. In the shock-adapted coordinates, the compressible Euler equations on $\mathbb{S}^2$ can be recast into a form suitable for self-similar analysis. Within this framework, we implement a detailed bootstrap argument and establish global well-posedness for the self-similar system. After transferring these results back to the original physical system, we thereby demonstrate the finite-time shock formation on $\mathbb{S}^2$.</description>

      <title>Solutions with clustering concentration layers to the Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following Ambrosetti-Prodi type problem \begin{equation}\label{e50} \left\{\begin{array}{ll} -div (A(x)\nabla u)=|u|^p-t\mathbf{\Psi}(x), &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$,} \\ u=0, &amp; \mbox{on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, $t&gt;0$, $p&gt;3$ and $\mathbf{\Psi}$ is an eigenfunction corresponding to the first eigenvalue of the following operator \[\mathfrak{L}(u)=-div (A(x)\nabla u).\] Moreover, $A(x)=\{A_{ij}(x)\}_{2\times 2}$ is a symmetric positive defined matrix function. Let $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ be a closed curve and also a non-degenerate critical point of the functional \[\mathcal{K}(\Gamma)=\int_\Gamma \mathbf{\Psi}^{\frac{p+3}{2p}}dvol_{\mathfrak{g}},\] where $\mathfrak{g}(X,Y)=\langle A^*X,Y\rangle$ is a Riemannian metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A^*$ is the adjoint matrix for $A$. We prove that there exists a sequence of $t=t_l\to +\infty$ such that this problem has solutions $u_{t_l}$ with clustering concentration layers directed along $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Poho\v{z}aev identity and the existence of normalized ground state solutions for variable exponent problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate normalized solutions for nonlinear problems involving variable exponents. To the best of our knowledge, normalized solutions have not been previously studied in this setting, and our results appear to be new. A key difficulty is that the standard scaling argument, which is important in the classical normalized solution approach, is no longer available in the variable exponent setup. To address this, we work with a constrained variational framework and establish the existence of a ground state solution. We further show that these solutions are $C^{1,\alpha}_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Finally, we derive a Poho\v zaev-type identity adapted to the variable exponent structure in $\mathbb{R}^N$, which is used to prove that the solution is a ground state.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the skew mean curvature flow for large data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skew mean curvature flow is an evolution equation for $d$ dimensional ma\-nifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ (or more generally, in a Riemannian manifold). It can be viewed as a Schr\"odinger analogue of the mean curvature flow, or alternatively as a quasilinear version of the Schr\"odinger Map equation. In this article, we prove large data local well-posedness in low-regularity Sobolev spaces for the skew mean curvature flow in dimension $d\geq 2$. This is achieved by introducing several new ideas: (i) a time discretization method to establish the existence of smooth solutions, (ii) constructing the orthonormal frame by a parallel transport method and a lifting criterion, (iii) introducing intrinsic fractional function spaces $X^s\subset H^s$ on a noncompact manifold for any $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}$, such that the $X^s$-norm of the second fundamental form can be propagated well along the quasilinear Schr\"odinger flow, (iv) deriving a difference equation to prove the uniqueness result for solutions $F\in C^2$, which is independent in the choices of gauge. Our method turns out to be more robust for large data problem.</description>

      <title>Principal eigenvalues and asymptotic behavior for the weighted $p$-Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions on exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral theory of the p-Laplacian is well developed for classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, but the transitional Robin regime on exterior domains remains largely unexplored. This paper studies a weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space of dimension N, with N greater than p. The weight function belongs to a critical Lorentz class and decays at infinity. Under natural assumptions on the weight, we prove the existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of a positive principal eigenvalue and establish local first-order regularity of the associated eigenfunction. We analyze the dependence of the principal eigenvalue on the Robin parameter and recover the Neumann and Dirichlet limits as the parameter approaches zero and infinity, respectively. The far-field behavior of the eigenfunction exhibits a universal algebraic decay rate that is independent of the Robin parameter, while the near-boundary structure displays an explicit scaling with respect to the parameter. We further investigate the gradient behavior of the eigenfunction, showing the existence of a unique critical radius and providing quantitative bounds on both the critical radius and the boundary value in terms of the Robin parameter. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of unified gradient estimates that connect the near-boundary and far-field regions through a characteristic length scale determined by the Robin parameter, yielding a global description of how boundary effects penetrate into the exterior domain.</description>

      <title>Stability for the inverse random potential scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse random potential problem for the Schr\"odinger equation. The random potential is assumed to be a generalized Gaussian random function, whose covariance operator is a classical pseudo-differential operator. For the direct problem, the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the Schr\"odinger operator with rough potentials is investigated, which yields the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem and a Born series expansion. For the inverse problem, we derive a probabilistic stability estimate for determining the principle symbol of the covariance operator of the random potential. The stability result provides an estimate of the probability for an event when the principle symbol can be quantitatively determined by a single realization of the multi-frequency backscattered far-field pattern. The analysis employs the ergodicity theory and quantitative analytic continuation principle.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of positive solutions to mixed local and nonlocal critical problems in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following mixed local and non-local critical elliptic equation:
  \begin{equation*}\label{0.1}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lll}
  -\Delta u+(-\Delta)^su=\lambda h u^{p}+u^{2^*-1}, &amp;\text{in}\,\, \mathbb{R}^n,
  u&gt;0, &amp;\text {in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^n,
  \lim\limits_{|x|\to\infty} u(x) = 0,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} where $n\geqslant4, \,\, p\in (0,2^*-1),\,\, 2^*:=\frac{2n}{n-2}$ and $h$ is a positive function.
  We first show the existence and regularity results of viscosity solutions to the above critical elliptic equation. More precisely, from \cite{Su-Xu} weak solutions are obtained and we prove they are indeed viscosity solutions and their regularity is: \( u \in C^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n) \) for $p\in(0,1);$ \( u \in C^{2,\beta}(\mathbb{R}^n) \) for $p\in [1, 2^*-1).$
  Moreover, for $p\in [1, 2^*-1)$, these viscosity solutions are indeed classical ones and we then prove the existence of positive solutions with the qualitative properties such as the decay estimates and the radial symmetry.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation for 1-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with nonzero random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the wave propagation for a reaction-diffusion equation on the real line, with a random drift and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) type nonlinear reaction. We show that when the average drift is positive, the asymptotic wave fronts propagating to the positive and negative directions are both pushed in the negative direction, leading to the possibility that both wave fronts propagate toward negative infinity. Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula. Such probabilistic arguments also reveal the underlying physical mechanism of the wave fronts formation: the drift acts as an external field that shifts the (quenched) free-energy reference level without altering the intrinsic fluctuation structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Optimal Convergence Estimate of the Limit from Inverse Power Potential to Hard Sphere Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse power potential $U(r)=r^{-1/s}, 0&lt;s&lt;1$, generates the Boltzmann kernel $B^{s}=|v-v_*|^{1-4s} b_s(\theta)$ with an angular singularity as $\theta\to 0$. Jang-Kepka-Nota-Vel\'azquez (2023) proved the limit $B^{s}\to \frac14|v-v_*|$ as $s\to 0$, as well as weak convergence of solutions based on this kernel convergence. In this work we establish the following sharp quantitative estimate: $$ |b_s(\theta)-\tfrac14| \le C\, s\,\theta^{-2-2s}. $$ In particular, this sharp estimate yields the optimal $O(s)$ convergence rate for solutions of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with large initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces; i.e., for any $t\in[0,T]$, we have $$f^s(t)=f^0(t)+O(s),$$ quantified by the $L^1_k$ norm for $k\ge 2.$</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show the existence of an unbounded sequence of minimax eigenvalues for the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian via the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. As an application of these minimax eigenvalues and $p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality proved in [4], we prove new existence results for nonlocal Dirichlet problems involving logarithmic $p$-Laplacian and nonlinearities with $p$-superlinear and subcritical growth at infinity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for the spectrum of the Laplacian in thin bars with varying cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spectral problems for Laplace operator in 3D rod structures with a small cross section of diameter $O(\varepsilon)$, $\varepsilon$ being a positive parameter. The boundary conditions are Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) on the bases of this structure and Neumann on the lateral boundary. As $\varepsilon\to 0$, we show the convergence of the spectrum with conservation of the multiplicity towards that of a 1D spectral model with Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) boundary conditions. This 1D model may arise in diffusion or vibrations models of nonhomogeneous media with different physical characteristics and it takes into account the geometry of the 3D domain. We deal with the low frequencies and the approach to eigenfunctions in the suitable Sobolev spaces is also outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low regularity local well-posedness of two-dimensional irrotational deep hydroelastic waves. Building on the approach of Ifrim-Tataru [29] and Ai-Ifrim-Tataru [5], in particular by constructing a cubic modified energy that incorporates a paradifferential weight chosen carefully, we prove that the hydroelastic waves are locally well-posed in $\mathcal{H}^s$ for $s&gt;\frac{3}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Decay of Mass of the Solution to the Cauchy Problem of the p-Laplacian with Absorption on Infinite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the nonstationary discrete p-Laplacian with inhomogeneous density \r{ho}(x) on an infinite graph which supports the Sobolev inequality. For nonnegative solutions when p &gt; 2, we prove the precise rate of stabilization in time, provided \r{ho}(x) is a non-power function. When p &gt; 2 and \r{ho}(x) goes to zero fast enough, we prove the universal bound. Our technique relies on suitable energy inequalities and a new embedding result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances regarding the long-time dynamics of space-periodic water waves, focusing on 1) bifurcation of quasi-periodic solutions, both standing and traveling; 2) long-time well-posedness results; 3) modulational instability of Stokes waves. These results rely on unconventional approaches to KAM and Birkhoff normal form theories for Hamiltonian quasi-linear PDEs and symplectic Kato perturbation theory for separated eigenvalues of reversible and Hamiltonian operators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Momentum of Dirac Particles in One Space Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the trajectories of a massive particle in one space dimension whose motion is guided by a spin-half wave function that evolves according to the free Dirac equation, with its initial wave function being a Gaussian wave packet with a nonzero expected value of momentum $k$ and the positive expected value of energy $E = \sqrt{m^2+k^2}$. We prove that at large times, the wave function becomes {\em locally} a plane wave, which corresponds to trajectories with fixed values for asymptotic momentum $k$ and asymptotic energy $E$ or $-E$. The sign of the asymptotic energy is determined by the initial position of the particle. Particles with negative energy will have an asymptotic velocity that is in the opposite direction of their momentum.
  The proof uses the stationary phase approximation method, for which we establish a rigorous error bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the dynamics of Toda curves of order $N$ and derive differential equations governing this dynamics. We apply the obtained results to describe isoperiodic deformations of $N$-periodic Toda chains and periodic difference Korteweg-de Vries equation. We describe deformations of the essential spectra of $N$-periodic two-sided Jacobi matrices. We also study singular regimes of $SU(N)$ Seiberg-Witten theory and describe their deformations preserving the number of singularities where new massless particles may occur. We introduce and describe isoequilibrium deformations of arbitrary collections of $d$ real disjoint closed intervals. We conclude by providing explicit triangular solutions to constrained Schlesinger systems.</description>

      <title>Variance-Refined In-Diameter Lower Bound for the First Dirichlet Eigenvalue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonempty boundary and $n\geq 2$. Assume that ${\mathrm{Ric}(M)\ge (n-1)K}$ for some ${K&gt;0}$ and that $\partial M$ has nonnegative mean curvature with respect to the outward unit normal. Denote by $\lambda$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Ling's gradient-comparison method (Ling, 2006) provides an explicit lower bound for $\lambda$ in terms of $K$ and the in-diameter $\tilde d$ (twice the maximal distance from a point of $M$ to $\partial M$). We isolate the only step in Ling's argument that loses quantitative information: a Jensen-H\"older averaging that replaces a nonconstant one-dimensional comparison function by its mean. Using the uniform strong convexity of $x\to x^{-1/2}$ on $(0,1]$, we refine this averaging by a variance term and thereby retain part of the discarded oscillation. This yields an explicit closed-form in-diameter bound that is strictly stronger than Ling's estimate for every $K&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>LSTM-PINN: An Hybrid Method for Prediction of Steady-State Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have demonstrated considerable success in solving complex fluid dynamics problems. However, their performance often deteriorates in regimes characterized by steep gradients, intricate boundary conditions, and stringent physical constraints, leading to convergence failures and numerical instabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks into the PINN architecture, enhancing its ability to capture spatial correlations in the steady-state velocity field of a two-dimensional charged fluid under an external electric field. Our results demonstrate that the LSTM-enhanced PINN model significantly outperforms conventional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based PINNs in terms of convergence rate, numerical stability, and predictive accuracy. This innovative approach offers improved computational efficiency and reliability for modeling electrohydrodynamic flows, providing new insights and strategies for applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Optimal-Transport Stability of Inverse Point-Source Problems for Elliptic and Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative global stability estimates, formulated in terms of optimal transport (OT) cost, for inverse point-source problems governed by elliptic and parabolic equations with spatially varying coefficients. The key idea is that the Kantorovich dual potential can be represented as a boundary functional of suitable adjoint solutions, thereby linking OT geometry with boundary observations. In the elliptic case, we construct complex geometric optics solutions that enforce prescribed pointwise constraints, whereas in the parabolic case we employ controllable adjoint solutions that transfer interior information to the boundary. Under mild regularity and separation assumptions, we obtain estimates of the form \[ \mathcal{T}_c(\mu,\nu) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{T}_c(\mu,\nu) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega\times[0,T])}, \] where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are admissible point-source measures. These results provide a unified analytical framework connecting inverse source problems and optimal transport, and establish OT-based stability theory for inverse source problems governed by partial differential equations with spatially varying coefficients.</description>

      <title>Large-time asymptotics for the defocusing Manakov system on nonzero background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Manakov system is a two-component nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The long-time asymptotics for the defocusing or focusing Manakov system under nonzero background still remains open. In this paper, we derive the long-time asymptotic formula for the solution of the defocusing Manakov system on nonzero boundary conditions and provide a detailed proof. The solution of the defocusing Manakov system on such nonzero background is first transformed into the solution of a $3 \times 3$ matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Then we demonstrate how to conduct the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis for this Riemann-Hilbert problem, thereby obtaining the long-time asymptotic behavior of the solution in the space-time soliton region. In this region, the leading order of the solution takes the form of a modulated multisoliton. Apart from the error term, we also discover that the defocusing Manakov system has a dispersive correction term of order $t^{-1/2}$, but this term does not exist in the scalar case, and we provide the explicit expression for this dispersion term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Lax pairs for the recently (2023) introduced integrable PDE systems known as the BKM equations. As many known and previously studied integrable systems are special cases of the BKM systems, our construction provides Lax pairs for many integrable hierarchies, including previously studied ones such as Camassa-Holm, Dullin-Gottwald-Holm, cKdV, Ito, and Marvan-Pavlov, as well as new ones. The corresponding pair is related to a Sturm-Liouville operator on the real line whose potential depends rationally on the spectral parameter.</description>

      <title>The Focusing NLS Equation on the Half-Line with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3264</link>
      <description>arXiv:0711.3264v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet problem for the focusing NLS equation on the half-line, with given Schwartz initial data and boundary data $q(0,t)$ equal to an exponentially decaying perturbation $u(t)$ of the periodic boundary data $ a e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ at $x=0.$ It is known from PDE theory that this problem admits a unique solution (for fixed initial data and fixed $u$). On the other hand, the associated inverse scattering transform formalism involves the Neumann boundary value for $x=0$. Thus the implementation of this formalism requires the understanding of the "Dirichlet-to-Neumann" map which characterises the associated Neumann boundary value.
  We consider this map in an indirect way: we postulate a certain Riemann-Hilbert problem, on a specified contour but with partially unspecified jump data of some generality, and then prove that the solution of the initial-boundary value problem for the focusing NLS constructed through this Riemann-Hilbert problem satisfies all the required properties: the data $q(x,0)$ are Schwartz and $q(0,t)-a e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon}$ is exponentially decaying.
  More specifically, we focus on the case $-3a^2 &lt; \omega &lt; a^2.$ By considering a large class of appropriate scattering data for the t-problem, we provide solutions of the above Dirichlet problem such that the data $q_x(0,t)$ is given by an exponentially decaying perturbation of the function $2iab e^{2i\omega t + i \epsilon},$ where $\omega = a^2-2b^2,~~b&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.06763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While weak diffusive limit from the Boltzmann equation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system was established for the Maxwell boundary condition within renormalized solutions framework [Saint.Raymond2009][Jiang-Masmoudi2017], the corresponding strong diffusive limit has remained outstanding except when the accommodation coefficient $\alpha \sim \varepsilon^{1/2}$ [Jiang-Masmoudi2017]. We establish global in time strong diffusive limit for all accommodation coefficients $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ within strong solutions framework. The main novelties of our proof include: (1) a $\varepsilon$-stretching method for reduction to a single-bounce $L^\infty$ estimate; (2) a dissipation estimate for a carefully constructed rotating Maxwellian in the near-specular regime $\alpha \ll \varepsilon$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ on the subprincipal symbol is sufficient for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. These are the operators having real principal symbol, which is of principal type and vanishes of second order on an involutive manifold where the subprincipal symbol is of principal type. Condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ is a condition on the sign changes of the imaginary part of the subprincipal symbol, which has previously been shown by the author to be necessary for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. In the appendix, we study the local solvability of quasilinear second order partial differential operators of real principal type.</description>

Abstract: We prove local (in time) existence and uniqueness for a class of infinite-dimensional Nash systems, namely systems of infinitely many Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations set in an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space. Such systems have been recently showed (see arXiv:2401.06534) to arise in the theory of stochastic differential games with interactions governed by sparse graphs, under structural assumptions that inspired the hypotheses exploited in the present work. Contextually, we also prove a general linear result, providing a priori estimates, stable with respect to the dimension, for transport-diffusion equations whose drifts (and their derivatives) enjoy appropriate decay properties.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These problems were first studied for geodesic X-ray transforms by Stefanov and Uhlmann (Analysis \&amp; PDE, {\bf 5} (2012), pp.219--260). After that Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494) proved refined results according to the degree of regular conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war games related to $p$-Laplace type equations with zeroth order terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of tug-of-war games that incorporate a constant payoff discount rate at each turn. The associated model problems are $p$-Laplace type partial differential equations with zeroth-order terms. We establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for the corresponding game value functions. Furthermore, we explore properties of the solutions to the model PDEs, informed by the analysis of the underlying games.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for semilinear elliptic equations with generalized Kerr-type nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing the shape of unknown inclusions in semilinear elliptic equations with nonanalytic nonlinearities, by extending Ikehata's enclosure method to accommodate such nonlinear effects. To address the analytical challenges, we construct an approximate solution based on the linearized equation, enabling the enclosure method to operate in this setting. The proposed method applies to a broad class of semilinear elliptic equations with non-analytic nonlinearities, including representative examples such as the Kerr-type nonlinearity, which appears in models of nonlinear optics, and the Ginzburg-Landau-type nonlinearity, which models light propagation in nonlinear dissipative media.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness of the full coupled Navier-Stokes and Q-tensor system in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the weak-strong uniqueness for the Leray-Hopf type weak solutions to the Beris-Edwards model of nematic liquid crystals in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with an arbitrary parameter $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$, which measures the ratio of tumbling and alignment effects caused by the flow. This result is obtained by proposing a new uniqueness criterion in terms of $(\Delta Q,\nabla u)$ with regularity $L_t^qL_x^p$ for $\frac{2}{q}+\frac{3}{p}=\frac{3}{2}$ and $2\leq p\leq 6$, which enable us to deal with the additional nonlinear difficulties arising from the parameter $\xi$. Comparing with the results of related literature, our finding also reveals a new regime of weak-strong uniqueness for the simplified case of $\xi=0$. Moreover, we establish the global well-posedness of this model for small initial data in $H^s$-framework.</description>

      <title>Transition threshold for the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition mechanism from laminar flow to turbulent flow is a central problem in hydrodynamic stability theory. To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\it \small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\mathrm{Re}\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\mathrm{Re}$. Precisely, we show that if the initial perturbation satisfies $$\|v_{in}-(y, 0, 0)\|_{\tilde{H}(\mathbb T \times \mathbb D)}\leq \epsilon_0 \,\mathrm{Re}^{-\alpha},$$ with any $\alpha&gt;\frac 23$ and $\tilde{H}=H^6 \cap W^{3,1}$ for $\mathbb D=\mathbb{R}^2$, and with any $\alpha \geq\frac 56$ and $\tilde{H}=H^6$ for $\mathbb D=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$, the corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system exists globally in time and remains asymptotically close to the Couette flow. The main analytical challenge arises from the anisotropic nature of the estimates for the zero modes and from the interactions between zero and non-zero modes, which we address using an anisotropic Sobolev space directly tailored to the zero modes. Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Approximation results for weak solutions of stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In probability theory, how to approximate the solution of a stochastic differential equation is an important topic. In Watanabe's classical textbook, by an approximation of the Wiener process, solutions of approximated equations converge to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In traditional approximation theorems, solutions do not contain the spatial variable. In recent years, stochastic partial differential equations have been playing major roles in probability theory. If the solution is a weak one with the spatial variable, we may not be able to directly apply these classical approximation results. In this work, we try to extend the approximation result to stochastic partial differential equations case. We show that in this case, the approximation result still holds.</description>

      <title>On the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions of SDEs with state-dependent variable exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a time-inhomogeneous nonlinear SDE with drift and diffusion governed by state-dependent variable exponents. This framework generalizes models like the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the constant elasticity of variance (CEV), offering flexibility to capture complex dynamics while posing analytical challenges. Using a fixed-point approach, we prove existence and uniqueness, analyze higher-order moments, derive asymptotic estimates, and assess stability. Finally, we illustrate an application where the Poisson equation admits a probabilistic representation via a time-homogeneous nonlinear SDE with state-dependent variable exponents.</description>
