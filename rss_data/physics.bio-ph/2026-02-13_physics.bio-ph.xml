      <title>How cross-disciplinary science can describe living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experience shows that disciplinary science cannot describe life without contradictions. We show that one of the fundamental reasons is the disciplinarity itself: the disciplines deal with a limited set of quantities. This way some 'outlaw' quantities are not measured and the discipline does not have laws about them. All laws of science are based on approximations and the approximations must be different for inanimate and life sciences. Studying ions is special because ions belong simultaneously to thermodynamics and electricity, but neither of those disciplines alone can describe biological processes. One needs a cross-disciplinary discussion and maybe a new scientific discipline. We provide a method for handling the different interaction speeds characterizing the ion transport. Electrolytes in living matter introduce further peculiarities with their closed volumes, internal structure, and slow processes. Their meticulous analysis led to the appropriate approximations, leading to the correct scientific description. As a success story, the cross-disciplinary theory of neuronal operation has been developed.</description>

      <title>Transition from traveling fronts to diffusion-limited growth in expanding populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading. The model applies to dense cellular aggregates of nonmotile cells consuming a diffusible nutrient. The sublinear spread results from biomass redistribution slowing due to nutrient depletion, a phenomenon supported experimentally but often neglected. Our results provide a potential explanation for the linear rather than quadratic increase of colony area with time, which has been observed for many microbes.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-Optimized Optogenetic Study of Network-Level Potentiation in Cortical Cultures on Microelectrode Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory, yet its investigation at the network level in vitro remains challenging, particularly when optogenetic stimulation is used. The objective of this work is to develop a robust experimental and analytical framework for inducing and quantifying optogenetically driven LTP in neuronal cultures recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Approach. We first systematically investigate the effect of widefield optogenetic stimulation frequency on evoked neuronal activity, to identify a test-stimulus that reliably probes network responses without inducing activity modulation. By analyzing spike-rate dynamics during repeated stimulation, we characterize frequency-dependent response adaptation consistent with Channelrhodopsin-2 photocycle kinetics. Based on these results, an optimized low-frequency test-stimulus is selected and combined with a spatially confined tetanic optogenetic stimulation to induce LTP. Network responses are quantified using post-stimulus time histograms and a normalized efficacy metric, enabling electrode-wise and network-level analysis of plasticity. Main results. Low-frequency optical stimulation (&lt;= 0.2 Hz) preserves stable evoked responses, whereas higher frequencies induce a pronounced sigmoid-like decay in firing rate. Following tetanic stimulation, a subset of electrodes exhibits robust and long-lasting potentiation, persisting for several hours. Significance. This work provides a systematic methodology for studying activity-dependent plasticity in optogenetically driven neuronal networks.</description>

      <title>Protein Language Model Embeddings Improve Generalization of Implicit Transfer Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a central computational tool in physics, chemistry, and biology, enabling quantitative prediction of experimental observables as expectations over high-dimensional molecular distributions such as Boltzmann distributions and transition densities. However, conventional MD is fundamentally limited by the high computational cost required to generate independent samples. Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins. We further study the impact of additional conditioning signals -- such as structural embeddings, temperature, and large-language-model-derived embeddings -- on model performance.</description>

      <title>Early stages of collective cell invasion: Biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stages of the collective invasion may occur by single mesenchymal cells or hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell groups that detach from cancerous tissue. Tumors may also emit invading protrusions of epithelial cells, which could be led (or not) by a basal cell. Here we devise a fractional step cellular Potts model comprising passive and active cells able to describe these different types of collective invasion before cells start proliferating. Durotaxis and active forces have different symmetry properties and are included in different half steps of the fractional step method. Compared with a single step method, fractional step produces more realistic cellular invasion scenarios with little extra computational effort. Biochemical mechanisms that determine how cells acquire their different phenotypes and cellular proliferation will be incorporated to the model in future publications.</description>

      <title>Information bounds production in replicator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental fluctuations can shape replicator dynamics, with important consequences for both prebiotic and modern ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how simple replicators can acquire and use information about fluctuating environments, given that such information processing is often assumed to require sophisticated mechanisms for sensing and control. Here, we show that even simple replicator networks can increase productivity by exploiting environmental information in a functional way. Using a model of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor, we derive an information-theoretic decomposition of productivity, with separate contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We derive optimal strategies and universal bounds on the benefit of information and compare our findings with existing work, including ``Kelly gambling'' in information theory. By applying our framework to a model of real-world molecular replicators, we demonstrate the benefits of internal memory and propose an experimental setup for detecting functional information in a minimal chemical system.</description>

      <title>A solution to the mystery of the sub-harmonic series via a linear model of the cochlea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>
