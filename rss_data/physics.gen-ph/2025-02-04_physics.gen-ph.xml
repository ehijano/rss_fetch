      <title>A model of mass generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we build a model to combine the mass generated from the Higgs mechanism and that from the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking mechanism. This is motivated by the fermion mass hierarchy that the neutrino mass is smaller than the charged lepton mass and the charged lepton mass is smaller than the quark mass. Since they participate different interactions, it is natural to conjecture that interactions contribute to the fermion mass. This conjecture could be explained via the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking mechanism with assuming the existence of a non-perturbative regime. In addition, this model predicts a different ratio of fermion Yukawa coupling to the Higgs self coupling, which could be verified in the near future.</description>

      <title>Doppler, gravitational and cosmological redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ortiz and Ibarra-Castor (2024) have presented a "Generalized redshift formula" taking account of only energy conservation considerations. Contrary to their claim, we emphasize to invoke both energy and momentum considerations in order to deduce all three types of redshift (Doppler, gravitational and cosmological). We formulate our views on the three physical effects in a consistent manner in addition to addressing the lack of relevant references in Ref.(Ortizand Ibarra-Castor, 2024).</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement without nonlocal causation in (3,2)-dimensional spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17070v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model to investigate whether the ability of two quantum entangled particles to "correlate" their behaviors even at very large distances and in the absence of any physical connection can be seen as due to an exchange of information through an extra-temporal dimension. Since superluminal information exchange is forbidden in our (3,1) spacetime, an extra-temporal dimension is needed to recover the physical picture of finite velocity information exchange between entangled entities. Assuming that the geometry of space-time of dimension (3,2) is described by a metric containing a warping factor, the confinement of the massive particles in the extra time dimension follows. Therefore, why we do not experience an infinitely large extra time dimension can be explained. The toy model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wavefunction collapse using nonlinear (non-unitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model so obtained is just speculative without any claim of being robust against any criticism, nevertheless, it satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be verified experimentally; in fact, it proposes an experiment potentially interesting which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful.</description>

      <title>Tiling Spaces and the Expanding Universe: Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a heuristic model of the universe as a growing quasicrystal projected from a higher-dimensional lattice. This quasicrystalline framework offers a novel perspective on cosmic expansion, where the intrinsic growth dynamics naturally give rise to the observed large-scale expansion of the universe. Motivated by this model, we explore the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle in a box with time-dependent boundaries, representing the expanding underlying space. By introducing a constraint that links microscale quantum phenomena with macroscale cosmological quantities, we derive an equation resembling the Friedmann equation, providing potential insights into the Hubble tension. Our model incorporates phonons and phasons-quasiparticles inherent in quasicrystalline structures-that play critical roles in cosmic-scale dynamics and the universe's expansion. This framework suggests that the necessity for an inflationary period may be obviated. Furthermore, phonons arising from the quasicrystalline structure may serve as dark matter candidates, influencing the dynamics of ordinary matter while remaining largely undetectable through electromagnetic interactions. Drawing parallels with crystalline matter at atomic scales, which is fundamentally quantum in nature, we explore how the notion of tiling space can support continuous symmetry atop a discrete structure. This provides a novel framework for understanding the universe's expansion and underlying structure. Consequently, our approach suggests that further development could enhance our understanding of cosmic expansion and the universe's structure, bridging concepts from quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Models for nuclear fusion in the solid state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical framework for enhancing nuclear fusion rates in solid-state environments under near-ambient conditions. Drawing on quantum tunneling, electron screening, and resonance energy transfer, the study proposes rate enhancements of more than 40 orders of magnitude for deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion in palladium lattices. A generalized nuclear Dicke model describes a fusion-fission process as a result of energy transfer between D-D and palladium mediated by lattice vibrations. Practical challenges such as decoherence, destructive interference, receiver decay, and achieving resonance between donor and receiver systems are addressed. Experimental strategies to validate the model are proposed along with its implications for the advancement of solid-state fusion as a potential pathway to sustainable energy technologies.</description>
