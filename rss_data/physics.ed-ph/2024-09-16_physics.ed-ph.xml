      <title>Using Peer-Customers to Scalably Pair Student Teams with Customers for Hands-on Curriculum Final Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-customer is a mechanism to pair student teams with customers in hands-on curriculum courses. Each student pitches a problem they want someone else in the class to solve for them. The use of peer-customers provides practical and scalable access for students to work with a customer on a real-world need for their final project. The peer-customer, despite being a student in the class, do not work on the project with the team. This dissociation forces a student team to practice customer needs assessment, testing, and surveying that can often be lacking in self-ideated final projects that do not have resources to curate external customers like in capstone courses. We prototyped the use of peer-customers in an introductory physical prototyping course focused on basic embedded systems design and python programming. In this paper, we present a practical guide on how best to use peer-customers, supported by key observations made during two separate offerings of the course with a total of N=64 students (N=29 Y1 and N=35 Y2).</description>

      <title>Participatory Science and Machine Learning Applied to Millions of Sources in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are merging a large participatory science effort with machine learning to enhance the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). Our overall goal is to remove false positives, allowing us to use lower signal-to-noise data and sources with low goodness-of-fit. With six million classifications through Dark Energy Explorers, we can confidently determine if a source is not real at over 94% confidence level when classified by at least ten individuals; this confidence level increases for higher signal-to-noise sources. To date, we have only been able to apply this direct analysis to 190,000 sources. The full sample of HETDEX will contain around 2-3M sources, including nearby galaxies ([O II] emitters), distant galaxies (Lyman-alpha emitters or LAEs), false positives, and contamination from instrument issues. We can accommodate this tenfold increase by using machine learning with visually-vetted samples from Dark Energy Explorers. We have already increased by over ten-fold in number of sources that have been visually vetted from our previous pilot study where we only had 14,000 visually vetted LAE candidates. This paper expands on the previous work increasing the visually-vetted sample from 14,000 to 190,000. In addition, using our currently visually-vetted sample, we generate a real or false positive classification for the full candidate sample of 1.2 million LAEs. We currently have approximately 17,000 volunteers from 159 countries around the world. Thus, we are applying participatory or citizen scientist analysis to our full HETDEX dataset, creating a free educational opportunity that requires no prior technical knowledge.</description>
