      <title>Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at 10 K and robust Tc under high pressure in TiNbTaN3 medium-entropy nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been one of the focal points in medium and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) since the first discovery of the HEA superconductor in 2014. Until now, most HEAs' superconducting transition temperature (Tc) has not exceeded 10 K. Here we report the first observation of superconductivity in a bulk medium-entropy nitride (MEN), TiNbTaN3, which shows a Tc of 10 K at ambient pressure. Notably, the electronic specific heat coefficient {\gamma}(H) exhibits nonlinear H-dependence behavior, which is similar to other well-studied multigap superconductors. Furthermore, TiNbTaN3 exhibits extraordinary pressure resilience, maintaining robust superconductivity under high-pressure conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that pressure exerts a negligible impact on the electronic structures of TiNbTaN3, thereby corroborating the experimental observations. These findings not only advance our understanding of emergent phenomena in entropy-stabilized nitrides but also establish a new material platform for finding more high-Tc superconductors with combinations of 4d/5d transition metal elements and light elements, motivating further investigations into high-entropy functional ceramics for extreme environment applications.</description>

      <title>Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</description>

      <title>Pure nematic transition inside the superconducting dome of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematicity and magnetism are prevalent orders in high transition temperature (Tc) superconductors, coexisting in the parent compound of most material families. Quantum fluctuations of nematicity or spin orders are both plausible candidates for mediating unconventional Cooper pairing. Identifying the sole effect of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP) on the emergence of superconducting dome without interference of spin fluctuations is therefore highly desirable. The iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe exhibits pure nematicity without any magnetic ordering. A nematic quantum phase transition can be induced by Te substitution but experimental study of such transition is so far limited to its normal state. By performing local susceptometry on composition-spread FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films ($0 &lt; x &lt; 1$) using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (sSQUID) microscopy, we investigate the superfluid density ($\rho_s$) across the pure nematic transition in extremely fine steps of ${\Delta}x$ = 0.0008. The temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ changes from the form of anisotropic pairing on the nematic side to an isotropic one across the critical doping $x_c$. The power-law dependence of gap anisotropy on $|x - x_c|$ provides evidence for nematic quantum criticality under the superconducting dome. The low-temperature $\rho_s$ scales linearly with Tc in the nematic phase $x &lt; x_c$, whereas the gap amplitude, maximized at $x_c$, determines the Tc for $x&gt;x_c$. Our results establish a pure nematic QCP in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, separating two superconducting orders with distinct pairing boosted by nematic quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>High-pressure high-temperature solution growth, structural, and superconducting properties of Fe-substituted MgB2 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clarifying the impact of Fe doping on the structural and superconducting properties of MgB2 is crucial, considering that iron is commonly used as a sheath material for the fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wires and tapes. To date the effects of Fe doping have only been investigated in polycrystalline samples, but the obtained results are controversial. Here, we report the successful growth of Mg1-xFexB2 single crystals in a quaternary Mg-Fe-B-N system using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 3 GPa and a temperature of 1960 {\deg}C. The grown crystals exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.1 mm3. The variation of the critical temperature Tc of Mg1-xFexB2 crystals with Fe content was found to be different from that observed in polycrystalline samples. For a small Fe doping, up to x &lt; 0.03, the behaviour of Tc(x) is similar to that for the crystals with Al and C substitutions, which suggests that Fe is in non-magnetic state. In this doping range, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization performed in high magnetic fields exclude spin states other than S = 0 for the Fe ions. However, for x &gt; 0.03, certain crystals start to show a dramatic decrease in Tc, suggesting that Fe might be in a magnetic state. The M-H dependence for these crystals shows significant increase of magnetization with increasing field in low magnetic field, pointing to a weak ferromagnetism. Overall, the availability of Fe substituted MgB2 single crystals exhibiting such peculiar behaviour offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of disorder alone on one hand and the influence of magnetic substituent on the superconducting characteristics on the other.</description>

      <title>Effect of spark plasma sintering on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We optimize the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide (Sm1111: SmFeAsO0.80F0.20) by using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique under various synthesis conditions, including heating temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 {\deg}C for durations of 5 to 30 minutes at the applied pressure of 45 MPa. All prepared bulks are characterized by structural and microstructural analysis as well as transport and magnetic measurements to conclude our findings. SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 bulks are also prepared using the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) and the high gas pressure and high temperature (HP-HTS) methods at 500 MPa, which exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of ~54 K. Interestingly, the SPS process of SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 increases the sample densities up to 97-98% and confirms the optimized synthesis conditions of 900{\deg}C for 5-10 min; however, the increased sintering temperature or duration reduces Tc due to the possible evaporation of lighter elements, particularly fluorine. Furthermore, the SPS technique is unable to reduce the observed impurity phases for the Sm1111, which is similar to the CSP and HP-HTS processes. A slight increment in the Jc by the SPS process is observed due to the enhancement of sample density. A comparative analysis of Sm1111 superconductors prepared by SPS is performed with CSP and HP-HTS processes, suggesting that an increased sample density is ineffective on the superconducting properties in the presence of the impurity phases. This finding can be beneficial for the fundamental and applied research of iron-based superconductor (FBS).</description>

      <title>Higher order Jacobi method for solving a system of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher-order Jacobi method, structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that, once the network parameters are determined for a known system, enables efficient resolution of system variations without re-computing the coefficients. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach moves beyond conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis demonstrates improved order of complexity, suggesting a promising direction for algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating QED inspired superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied a Lorentz-violating inspired Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity where we considered a CPT-odd contribution given by $(k_{AF})^{\mu}$, also known as the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In the static limit of the equations, we could find a pair of modified Ginzburg-Landau equations. Furthermore, these equations were reduced to the London equation for the magnetic field when assumed that the characteristic length of the order parameter is much smaller than the characteristic length of the magnetic field, i.e. the London penetration length. Our numerical solutions showed a simple Meissner state when this new term is small compared to $\lambda_L$ and a phase transition into phases with strong in-plane currents and anomalous vortices for large contributions. This model becomes useful in exemplifying the changes in the phenomenology of superconductors when the setup of the system shows an important breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Based on these results, we discuss how such models might be the hallmark of unusual superconducting states where there is a direction where the system shows stratification, as in anapole superconductors UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics in Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ from time-resolved optical reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ time-resolved optical reflectivity to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the charge-transfer gap (CTG) in a parent cuprate compound Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (CCOC). We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ as a new prototype structure for ternary superhydrides recoverable at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching pressures in the 100 GPa range enables the synthesis of hydrogen-rich compounds, with nontraditional H stoichiometries and H sublattices, called superhydrides. Record-breaking superconductivity temperature in some superhydrides have attracted great interest. A crucial next step is to stabilize superhydrides outside of high-pressure environments, leading to a search beyond binary hydrides to ternary hydrides. Here, we report the synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ at pressures starting at 60 GPa by compressing an hydrogenated Y-Fe compound, embedded in hydrogen in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction allowed us to resolve the Y$_3$Fe$_4$ lattice skeleton, and a constrained ab initio structural search was used to position the hydrogen atoms. FeH$_8$ cubic molecular units form building blocks which are connected edge-to-edge by sharing two hydrogen atoms, creating a framework that hosts Y cations. Remarkably, Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ maintains its structure through decompression, making it the first superhydride recovered metastable under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</description>

      <title>Zero-bias conductance peaks at zero applied magnetic field due to stray fields from integrated micromagnets in hybrid nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many recipes for realizing topological superconductivity rely on broken time-reversal symmetry, which is often attained by applying a substantial external magnetic field. Alternatively, using magnetic materials can offer advantages through low-field operation and design flexibility on the nanoscale. Mechanisms for lifting spin degeneracy include exchange coupling, spin-dependent scattering, spin injection-all requiring direct contact between the bulk or induced superconductor and a magnetic material. Here, we implement locally broken time-reversal symmetry through dipolar coupling from nearby micromagnets to superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. Josephson supercurrent is hysteretic due to micromangets switching. At or around zero external magnetic field, we observe an extended presence of Andreev bound states near zero voltage bias. We also show a zero-bias peak plateau of a non-quantized value. Our findings largely reproduce earlier results where similar effects were presented in the context of topological superconductivity in a homogeneous wire, and attributed to more exotic time-reversal breaking mechanisms [1]. In contrast, our stray field profiles are not designed to create Majorana modes, and our data are compatible with a straightforward interpretation in terms of trivial states in quantum dots. At the same time, the use of micromagnets in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices shows promise for future experiments on topological superconductivity.</description>
