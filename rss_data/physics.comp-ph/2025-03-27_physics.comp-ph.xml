      <title>The First Hardware Demonstration of a Universal Programmable RRAM-based Probabilistic Computer for Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a critical computational strategy in drug design and discovery, but the complex diversity of biomolecular structures and flexible binding conformations create an enormous search space that challenges conventional computing methods. Although quantum computing holds promise for these challenges, it remains constrained by scalability, hardware limitations, and precision issues. Here, we report a prototype of a probabilistic computer (p-computer) that efficiently and accurately solves complex molecular docking for the first time, overcoming previously encountered challenges. At the core of the system is a p-computing chip based upon our artificial tunable probabilistic bits (p-bits), which are compatible with computing-in-memory schemes, based upon 180 nm CMOS technology and BEOL HfO2 RRAM. We successfully demonstrated the superior performance of the p-computer in practical ligand-protein docking scenarios. A 42-node molecular docking problem of lipoprotein with LolA-LolCDE complex-a key point in developing antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, was successfully solved. Our results align well with the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler tool. This work marks the first application of p-computing in molecular docking-based computational biology, which has great potential to overcome the limitations in success rate and efficiency of current technologies in addressing complex bioinformatics problems.</description>

      <title>Fast, Modular, and Differentiable Framework for Machine Learning-Enhanced Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end differentiable molecular simulation framework (DIMOS) for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including particle-mesh Ewald electrostatics. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework bridges the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a PyTorch implementation. The superior performance and the high versatility is probed in different benchmarks and applications, with speed-up factors of up to $170\times$. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/nec-research/DIMOS.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of shell DFT-1/2 in high-throughput calculations via cutoff radii prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shell DFT-1/2 is a fast band gap rectification method that is versatile for semiconductor supercell and superlattice calculations, which involves two cutoff radii that have to be optimized. Although such optimization is trivial in terms of time cost for a primitive cell, in high-throughput calculations this can be a big concern because most materials are themselves in small unit cells. The numerous optimization trials increase the computational cost to orders of magnitudes higher. In this work, we construct a regression model for the prediction of the two cutoff radii based on chemical composition and primitive cell structure. Moreover, a model for metal and insulator classification is also given, with 95.2% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Solving 2-D Helmholtz equation in the rectangular, circular, and elliptical domains using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks offered an alternate way to solve several differential equations that govern complicated physics. However, their success in predicting the acoustic field is limited by the vanishing-gradient problem that occurs when solving the Helmholtz equation. In this paper, a formulation is presented that addresses this difficulty. The problem of solving the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with the prescribed boundary conditions is posed as an unconstrained optimization problem using trial solution method. According to this method, a trial neural network that satisfies the given boundary conditions prior to the training process is constructed using the technique of transfinite interpolation and the theory of R-functions. This ansatz is initially applied to the rectangular domain and later extended to the circular and elliptical domains. The acoustic field predicted from the proposed formulation is compared with that obtained from the two-dimensional finite element methods. Good agreement is observed in all three domains considered. Minor limitations associated with the proposed formulation and their remedies are also discussed.</description>

      <title>X-ray photoemission spectrum, electronic structure, and magnetism of UCu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The room temperature X-ray photoemission spectrum of the ferromagnetic compound UCu$_2$Si$_2$ (T$_C$ = 100 K) was measured using an Al K$_{\alpha}$ source. Related theoretical spectra were computed from densities of electronic states obtained in the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and using the GGA+U method. The calculated spectrum is in a good agreement with the experimental one. The spin polarized calculations based on the GGA+U approach as well as GGA/LSDA with orbital polarization (OP) corrections taken into account provide values of the total magnetic moment in reasonable agreement with the experimental values ranging between 1.6 and 2.0 $\mu_B$/U atom.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale, Long-Time Atomistic Simulations of Proton Transport in Polymer Electrolyte Membranes Using a Neural Network Interatomic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have attracted significant attention as a method that enables large-scale, long-time atomistic simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio wavefunction theories. However, a challenge with MLIP-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is their lower stability compared to those using conventional classical potentials. Analyzing highly heterogeneous systems or amorphous materials often requires large-scale and long-time simulations, necessitating the development of robust MLIPs that allow for stable MD simulations. In this study, using our neural network potential (NNP) generator, we construct an NNP model that enables large-scale, long-time MD simulations of perfluorinated ionomer membranes (Nafion) across a wide range of hydration levels. We successfully build a robust deep potential (DP) model by iteratively expanding the dataset through active-learning loops. Specifically, by combining the sampling of off-equilibrium structures via non-equilibrium DPMD simulations with the structure screening in a 3D structural feature space incorporating minimum interatomic distances, it is possible to significantly enhance the robustness of the DP model, which allows for stable MD simulations of large Nafion systems ranging from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 atoms for an extended duration of 31 ns. The MD simulations employing the developed DP model yield self-diffusion coefficients of hydrogen atoms that more closely match experimental values in a wide range of hydration levels compared to previous ab initio MD simulations of smaller systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-agentic framework for real-time, autonomous freeform metasurface design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Innovation in nanophotonics currently relies on human experts who synergize specialized knowledge in photonics and coding with simulation and optimization algorithms, entailing design cycles that are time-consuming, computationally demanding, and frequently suboptimal. We introduce MetaChat, a multi-agentic design framework that can translate semantically described photonic design goals into high-performance, freeform device layouts in an automated, nearly real-time manner. Multi-step reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue (AIM) paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation-conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multi-objective, multi-wavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. These concepts present a scientific computing blueprint for utilizing specialist design agents, surrogate solvers, and human interactions to drive multi-physics innovation and discovery.</description>

      <title>Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann method for wetting problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20605v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscale computational model to describe the interaction of a droplet with a solid. The model is based on the hybrid combination of the immersed boundary and the lattice Boltzmann computational schemes: the former is used to model the non-ideal sharp interface of the droplet coupled with the inner and outer fluids, simulated with the lattice Boltzmann scheme. We further introduce an interaction force to model the wetting interactions of the droplet with the solid: this interaction force is designed with the key computational advantage of providing a regularization of the interface profile close to the contact line, avoiding abrupt curvature changes that could otherwise cause numerical instabilities. The proposed model substantially improves earlier immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann models for wetting in that it allows a description of an ample variety of wetting interactions, ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic cases, without the need for any pre-calibration study on model parameters to be used. Model validations against theoretical results for droplet shape at equilibrium and scaling laws for droplet spreading dynamics are addressed.</description>

      <title>The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., arXiv:2410.17029 (2024)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by a disordered interface. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic slot models are employed to efficiently simulate electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer. Such models, which incorporate varying assumptions about the geometry of the openings, are typically coupled with electromagnetic surface integral equations that model electromagnetic scattering. In this paper, we introduce novel code-verification approaches and build upon our previously developed methodologies to assess the correctness of the numerical implementation of an arbitrary-depth slot model. Through these approaches, we measure the convergence rates of the different interacting sources of numerical error and demonstrate the impact of various factors on these rates for several cases.</description>

Abstract: This review article provides an overview of structurally oriented experimental datasets that can be used to benchmark protein force fields, focusing on data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and room temperature (RT) protein crystallography. We discuss what the observables are, what they tell us about structure and dynamics, what makes them useful for assessing force field accuracy, and how they can be connected to molecular dynamics simulations carried out using the force field one wishes to benchmark. We also touch on statistical issues that arise when comparing simulations with experiment. We hope this article will be particularly useful to computational researchers and trainees who develop, benchmark, or use protein force fields for molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. However, this approach involves projecting and averaging of the particles in a non-physically meaningful way resulting in inaccurate centre of masses. Instead the intrinsic weighted average should be computed, but the analytical calculation of this scales as $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$. Here, we propose a more computationally efficient approach to compute the intrinsic mean suitable for the majority of chemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>
