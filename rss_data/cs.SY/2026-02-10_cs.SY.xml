      <title>Hierarchical JEPA Meets Predictive Remote Control in Beyond 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless networked control systems, ensuring timely and reliable state updates from distributed devices to remote controllers is essential for robust control performance. However, when multiple devices transmit high-dimensional states (e.g., images or video frames) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks, a critical trade-off emerges between communication efficiency and control performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively. Control actions are derived within the embedding space, removing the need for state reconstruction. Simulation results on inverted cart-pole systems demonstrate that H-JEPA enables up to 42.83 % more devices to be supported under limited wireless capacity without compromising control performance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agentic AI for Fairness-Aware and Accelerated Multi-modal Large Model Inference in Real-world Mobile Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has transformed applications in natural language processing and content creation, yet centralized inference remains hindered by high latency, limited customizability, and privacy concerns. Deploying large models (LMs) in mobile edge networks emerges as a promising solution. However, it also poses new challenges, including heterogeneous multi-modal LMs with diverse resource demands and inference speeds, varied prompt/output modalities that complicate orchestration, and resource-limited infrastructure ill-suited for concurrent LM execution. In response, we propose a Multi-Agentic AI framework for latency- and fairness-aware multi-modal LM inference in mobile edge networks. Our solution includes a long-term planning agent, a short-term prompt scheduling agent, and multiple on-node LM deployment agents, all powered by foundation language models. These agents cooperatively optimize prompt routing and LM deployment through natural language reasoning over runtime telemetry and historical experience. To evaluate its performance, we further develop a city-wide testbed that supports network monitoring, containerized LM deployment, intra-server resource management, and inter-server communications. Experiments demonstrate that our solution reduces average latency by over 80% and improves fairness (Normalized Jain index) to 0.90 compared to other baselines. Moreover, our solution adapts quickly without fine-tuning, offering a generalizable solution for optimizing GenAI services in edge environments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Omniscient Observers for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes fully distributed omniscient observers for both heterogeneous and homogeneous linear multi-agent systems, through which each agent can estimate the states of all agents. The proposed observers not only contribute to distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in multi-player games, but also provide a designable self-organization mechanism for artificial swarms to emulate biological social behaviors, including sheepdog herding and honeybee dance communication.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Robust and Non-greedy Control Barrier Functions in Spacecraft Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft inspection and docking missions require controllers that can guarantee safety under thrust constraints and uncertainty. Input-constrained control barrier functions (ICCBFs) provide a framework for safety certification under bounded actuation; however, conventional ICCBF formulations can be overly conservative and exhibit limited robustness to uncertainty, leading to high fuel consumption and reduced mission feasibility. This paper proposes a framework in which the full hierarchy of class-$\mathcal{K}$ functions defining the ICCBF recursion is parameterized and learned, enabling localized shaping of the safe set and reduced conservatism. A control margin is computed efficiently using differential algebra to enable the learned continuous-time ICCBFs to be implemented on time-sampled dynamical systems typical of spacecraft proximity operations. A meta-reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train a policy that generates ICCBF parameters over a distribution of hidden physical parameters and uncertainties, using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Simulation results on cruise control, spacecraft inspection, and docking scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains safety while reducing fuel consumption and improving feasibility relative to fixed class-$\mathcal{K}$ ICCBFs, with the RNN showing a particularly strong advantage in the more complex inspection case.</description>

      <title>In-Context System Identification for Nonlinear Dynamics Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a powerful method for discovering parsimonious governing equations from data, but it often requires expert tuning of candidate libraries. We propose an LLM-aided SINDy pipeline that iteratively refines candidate equations using a large language model (LLM) in the loop through in-context learning. The pipeline begins with a baseline SINDy model fit using an adaptive library and then enters a LLM-guided refinement cycle. At each iteration, the current best equations, error metrics, and domain-specific constraints are summarized in a prompt to the LLM, which suggests new equation structures. These candidate equations are parsed against a defined symbolic form and evaluated on training and test data. The pipeline uses simulation-based error as a primary metric, but also assesses structural similarity to ground truth, including matching functional forms, key terms, couplings, qualitative behavior. An iterative stopping criterion ends refinement early if test error falls below a threshold (NRMSE &lt; 0.1) or if a maximum of 10 iterations is reached. Finally, the best model is selected, and we evaluate this LLM-aided SINDy on 63 dynamical system datasets (ODEBench) and march leuba model for boiling nuclear reactor. The results are compared against classical SINDy and show the LLM-loop consistently improves symbolic recovery with higher equation similarity to ground truth and lower test RMSE than baseline SINDy for cases with complex dynamics. This work demonstrates that an LLM can effectively guide SINDy's search through equation space, integrating data-driven error feedback with domain-inspired symbolic reasoning to discover governing equations that are not only accurate but also structurally interpretable.</description>

      <title>$\partial$CBDs: Differentiable Causal Block Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate physics, computation, and learning, demanding modeling frameworks that are simultaneously composable, learnable, and verifiable. Yet existing approaches treat these goals in isolation: causal block diagrams (CBDs) support modular system interconnections but lack differentiability for learning; differentiable programming (DP) enables end-to-end gradient-based optimization but provides limited correctness guarantees; while contract-based verification frameworks remain largely disconnected from data-driven model refinement. To address these limitations, we introduce differentiable causal block diagrams ($\partial$CBDs), a unifying formalism that integrates these three perspectives. Our approach (i) retains the compositional structure and execution semantics of CBDs, (ii) incorporates assume--guarantee (A--G) contracts for modular correctness reasoning, and (iii) introduces residual-based contracts as differentiable, trajectory-level certificates compatible with automatic differentiation (AD), enabling gradient-based optimization and learning. Together, these elements enable a scalable, verifiable, and trainable modeling pipeline that preserves causality and modularity while supporting data-, physics-, and constraint-informed optimization for CPS.</description>

      <title>Quantifying resilience for distribution system customers with SALEDI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of routine smaller outages on distribution system customers in terms of customer minutes interrupted can be tracked using conventional reliability indices. However, the customer minutes interrupted in large blackout events are extremely variable, and this makes it difficult to quantify the customer impact of these extreme events with resilience metrics. We solve this problem with the System Average Large Event Duration Index SALEDI that logarithmically transforms the customer minutes interrupted. We explain how this new resilience metric works, compare it with alternatives, quantify its statistical accuracy, and illustrate its practical use with standard outage data from five utilities.</description>

      <title>Urban Congestion Patterns under High Electric Vehicle Penetration: A Case Study of 10 U.S. Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the global energy transition and the rapid penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), the widening travel cost gap between EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) increasingly affects commuters' route choices and may reshape urban congestion patterns. Existing research remains in its preliminary exploratory phase. On the one hand, multi-class models do not account for fixed user class scenarios, which may not align with actual commuters; on the other hand, there is a lack of systematic quantitative analysis based on real-world complex road networks across multiple cities. As a result, the congestion effects induced by heterogeneous GV-EV cost structures may be mischaracterized or substantially underestimated. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-user equilibrium (MUE) assignment model for mixed GV-EV traffic, constructs a dual algorithm with convergence guarantees, and designs multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for congestion patterns. Using 10 representative U.S. cities as a case study, this research explores the evolution trends of traffic congestion under different EV penetration scenarios based on real city-level road networks and block-level commuter origin-destination (OD) demand. The results show that full EV penetration reduces average system travel time by 2.27%--10.78% across the 10 cities, with New Orleans achieving the largest reduction (10.78%) and San Francisco the smallest (2.27%), but the effectiveness of alleviating congestion exhibits urban heterogeneity. Moreover, for cities with sufficient network redundancy, benefits are primarily concentrated during the low to medium EV penetration stage (0-0.5), though cities with topological constraints (e.g., San Francisco) show more limited improvements throughout all penetration levels. This paper can provide a foundation for formulating differentiated urban planning and congestion management policies.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Continuous-Time Distributed Stochastic Gradient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework to study distributed optimization problems with stochastic gradients by employing a multi-agent system with continuous-time dynamics. Here the goal of the agents is to cooperatively minimize the sum of convex objective functions. When making decisions, each agent only has access to a stochastic gradient of its own objective function rather than the real gradient, and can exchange local state information with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. Particularly, the stochasticity is depicted by the Brownian motion. To handle this problem, we propose a continuous-time distributed stochastic gradient algorithm based on the consensus algorithm and the gradient descent strategy. Under mild assumptions on the connectivity of the graph and objective functions, using convex analysis theory, the Lyapunov theory and Ito formula, we prove that the states of the agents asymptotically reach a common minimizer in expectation. Finally, a simulation example is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimized Deployment of HAPS Systems for GNSS Localization Enhancement in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high altitude platform stations (HAPS) have been primarily explored as network infrastructure for communication services, their advantageous characteristics also make them promising candidates for augmenting GNSS localization. This paper proposes a metaheuristic framework to jointly optimize the number and placement of HAPS for GNSS enhancement in dense urban environments, considering practical constraints such as elevation masks, altitude limits, and ray-traced visibility from 3D city models. The problem is highly nonconvex due to the discrete HAPS count and the environment-dependent 3D Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). To address this, we develop a tailored version of the adaptive special-crowding distance non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ASDNSGA-II). Simulations show the method successfully identifies the minimum number of HAPS needed to satisfy a CRLB threshold and selects the configuration with the lowest CRLB within that minimum, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for future HAPS-aided positioning systems.</description>

      <title>Healthcare Facility Assignment Using Real-Time Length-of-Stay Predictions: Queuing-Theoretic and Simulation-driven Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longer stays at healthcare facilities, driven by uncertain patient load, inefficient patient flow, and lack of real-time information about medical care, pose significant challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Providing patients with estimates of their expected real-time length of stay (RT-LOS), generated as a function of the operational state of the healthcare facility at their anticipated time of arrival (as opposed to estimates of average LOS), can help them make informed decisions regarding which facility to visit within a network. In this study, we develop a healthcare facility assignment (HFA) algorithm that assigns healthcare facilities to patients using RT-LOS predictions at facilities within the network of interest. We describe the generation of RT-LOS predictions via two methodologies: (a) an analytical queuing-theoretic approach, and (b) a hybrid simulation-driven machine learning approach. Because RT-LOS predictors are highly specific to the queuing system in question, we illustrate the development of RT-LOS predictors using both approaches by considering the outpatient experience at primary health centers. Via computational experiments, we compare outcomes from the implementation of the RT-HFA algorithm with both RT-LOS predictors to the case where patients visit the facility of their choice. Computational experiments also indicated that the RT-HFA algorithm substantially reduced patient wait times and LOS at congested facilities and led to more equitable utilization of medical resources at facilities across the network. Finally, we show numerically that the effectiveness of the RT-HFA algorithm in improving outcomes is contingent on the level of compliance with the assignment decision.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Delay Trade-Off in LLM Offloading via Token-Level Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for intelligent mobile services but are computationally intensive for resource-constrained devices. Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows such devices to offload inference tasks to edge servers (ESs), yet introduces latency due to communication and serverside queuing, especially in multi-user environments. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware offloading framework that dynamically decides whether to perform inference locally or offload it to the ES, based on token-level uncertainty and resource constraints. We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries. Our experiments show that GOA consistently achieves a favorable trade-off, outperforming baseline strategies in both accuracy and latency across varying user densities, and operates with practical computation time. These results establish GOA as a scalable and effective solution for LLM inference in MEC environments.</description>

      <title>Trustworthiness Layer for Foundation Models in Power Systems: Application for N-k Contingency Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces for the first time, to our knowledge, a trustworthiness layer for foundation models in power systems. Using stratified conformal prediction, we devise adaptive, statistically valid confidence bounds for each output of a foundation model. For regression, this allows users to obtain an uncertainty estimate for each output; for screening, it supports conservative decisions that minimize false negatives. We demonstrate our method by enhancing GridFM, the first open-source Foundation Model for power systems, with statistically valid prediction intervals instead of heuristic error margins. We apply it for N-k contingency assessment, a combinatorial NP-Hard problem. We show that trustworthy GridFM can offer richer and more accurate information than DC Power Flow, having 2x-3x higher precision, while running up to 18x faster than AC Power Flow for systems up to 118 buses. Moving a step further, we also examine the ability of trustworthy GridFM to generalize to unseen high-order contingencies: through a rigorous analysis, we assess how a model trained on N-1 or N-2 outages extrapolates to unseen contingencies up to N-5.</description>

      <title>Robust and Gain-Scheduling ${\cal H}_2$ Control Techniques for LFT Uncertain and Parameter-Dependent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the robust ${\cal H}_2$ synthesis problem for linear fractional transformation (LFT) systems subject to structured uncertainty (parameter) and white-noise disturbances. By introducing an intermediate matrix variable, we derive convex synthesis conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that enable both robust and gain-scheduled controller design for parameter-dependent systems. The proposed framework preserves the classical white-noise and impulse-response interpretation of the ${\cal H}_2$ criterion while providing certified robustness guarantees, thereby extending optimal ${\cal H}_2$ control beyond the linear time-invariant setting. Numerical and application examples demonstrate that the resulting robust ${\cal H}_2$ controllers achieve significantly reduced conservatism and improved disturbance rejection compared with conventional robust ${\cal H}_\infty$-based designs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of attitude and air velocity estimation for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using IMU measurements and at least one Pitot tube measurement, with almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) guarantees. A cascade observer architecture is developed, in which a Riccati/Kalman-type filter estimates the body-fixed frame air velocity and the vehicle's tilt using IMU data as inputs and Pitot measurements as outputs. Under mild excitation conditions, the resulting air velocity and tilt estimation error dynamics are shown to be uniformly observable. The estimated tilt is then combined with magnetometer measurements in a nonlinear observer on SO(3) to recover the full attitude. Rigorous analysis establishes AGAS of the overall cascade structure under the uniform observability (UO) condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through validation on real flight data.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Koopman-Model Predictive Control for an AC-DC Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper experimentally demonstrates the Koopman-Model Predictive Control (K-MPC) for a real AC-DC converter. The converter is typically modeled with a nonlinear time-variant plant. We introduce a new dynamical approach to lifting measurable dynamics from the plant and constructing a linear time-invariant model that is consistent with control objectives of the converter. We show that the lifting approach, combined with the K-MPC controller, performs well across the full experimental system and outperforms existing control strategies in terms of both steady-state and transient responses.</description>

      <title>An Approach for the Qualitative Graphical Representation of the Describing Function in Nonlinear Systems Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The describing function method is a useful tool for the qualitative analysis of limit cycles in the stability analysis of nonlinear systems. This method is inherently approximate; therefore, it should be used for a fast qualitative analysis of the considered systems. However, plotting the exact describing function requires heavy mathematical calculations, reducing interest in this method especially from the point of view of control education. The objective of this paper is to enhance the describing function method by providing a new approach for the qualitative plotting of the describing function for piecewise nonlinearities involving discontinuities. Unlike the standard method, the proposed approach allows for a straightforward, hand-drawn plotting of the describing function using the rules introduced in this paper, simply by analyzing the shape of the nonlinearity. The proposed case studies show that the limit cycles estimation performed using the standard exact plotting of the describing function yields the same qualitative results as those obtained using the proposed qualitative method for plotting the describing function.</description>

      <title>A Multi-physics Simulation Framework for High-power Microwave Counter-unmanned Aerial System Design and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) operating under autonomous guidance has created an urgent need for non-kinetic neutralization methods that are immune to conventional radio-frequency jamming. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-physics simulation framework for the design and performance evaluation of a high-power microwave (HPM) counter-UAS system operating at 2.45\,GHz. The framework integrates electromagnetic propagation modelling, antenna pattern analysis, electromagnetic coupling to unshielded drone wiring harnesses, and a sigmoid-based semiconductor damage probability model calibrated to published CMOS latchup thresholds. A 10{,}000-trial Monte Carlo analysis incorporating stochastic variations in transmitter power, antenna pointing error, target wire orientation, polarization mismatch, and component damage thresholds yields system-level kill probabilities with 95\% confidence intervals. For a baseline configuration of 25\,kW continuous-wave power and a 60\,cm parabolic reflector (21.2\,dBi gain), the Monte Carlo simulation predicts a kill probability of $51.4\pm1.0$\% at 20\,m, decreasing to $13.1\pm0.7$\% at 40\,m. Pulsed operation at 500\,kW peak power (1\% duty cycle) extends the 90\% kill range from approximately 18\,m to 88\,m. The framework further provides parametric design maps, safety exclusion zone calculations compliant with ICNIRP 2020 guidelines, thermal management requirements, and waveguide mode analysis. All simulation codes and results are provided for full reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Residential Peak Load Reduction via Direct Load Control under Limited Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermostatically controlled loads and electric vehicles offer flexibility to reduce power peaks in low-voltage distribution networks. This flexibility can be maximized if the devices are coordinated centrally, given some level of information about the controlled devices. In this paper, we propose novel optimization-based control schemes with prediction capabilities that utilize limited information from heat pumps, electric water heaters, and electric vehicles. The objective is to flatten the total load curve seen by the distribution transformer by restricting the times at which the available flexible loads are allowed to operate, subject to the flexibility constraints of the loads to preserve customers' comfort. The original scheme was tested in a real-world setup, considering both winter and summer days. The pilot results confirmed the technical feasibility but also informed the design of an improved version of the controller. Computer simulations using the adjusted controller show that, compared to the original formulation, the improved scheme achieves greater peak reductions in summer. Additionally, comparisons were made with an ideal controller, which assumes perfect knowledge of the inflexible load profile, the models of the controlled devices, the hot water and space heating demand, and future electric vehicle charging sessions. The proposed scheme with limited information achieves almost half of the potential average daily peak reduction that the ideal controller with perfect knowledge would achieve.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual-Based Active Fault-Tolerant Control Scheme for Cyber-Physical Systems: Application to DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of active fault-tolerant control in cyber-physical systems composed of strictly passive linear-time invariant dynamic subsystems. We cast the problem as a constrained optimization problem and propose an augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics-based fault-tolerant control framework that enforces network-level constraints and provides optimality guarantees for the post-fault steady-state operation. By suitably interconnecting the primal-dual algorithm with the cyber-physical dynamics, we provide sufficient conditions under which the resulting closed-loop system possesses a unique and exponentially stable equilibrium point that satisfies the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of the constrained problem. The framework's effectiveness is illustrated through numerical experiments on a DC microgrid.</description>

      <title>Stability and stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics via singular perturbation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics, modeled as interconnections of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Motivated by the long-standing practice of neglecting transient tire dynamics in vehicle modeling and control, a rigorous justification is provided for such simplifications using singular perturbation theory. A perturbation parameter, defined as the ratio between a characteristic rolling contact length and the vehicle's longitudinal speed, is introduced to formalize the time-scale separation between rigid-body motion and tire dynamics. For sufficiently small values of this parameter, it is demonstrated that standard finite-dimensional techniques can be applied to analyze the local stability of equilibria and to design stabilizing controllers. Both state-feedback and output-feedback designs are considered, under standard stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Whilst the proposed controllers follow classical approaches, the novelty of the work lies in establishing the first mathematical framework that rigorously connects distributed tire models with conventional vehicle dynamics. The results reconcile decades of empirical findings with a formal theoretical foundation and open new perspectives for the analysis and control of ODE-PDE systems with distributed friction in automotive applications.</description>

      <title>Passivity-exploiting stabilization of semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the local stabilization problem for semilinear single-track vehicle models with distributed tire friction dynamics, represented as interconnections of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). A passivity-exploiting backstepping design is presented, which leverages the strict dissipativity properties of the PDE subsystem to achieve exponential stabilization of the considered ODE-PDE interconnection around a prescribed equilibrium. Sufficient conditions for local well-posedness and exponential convergence are derived by constructing a Lyapunov functional combining the lumped and distributed states. Both state-feedback and output-feedback controllers are synthesized, the latter relying on a cascaded observer. The theoretical results are corroborated with numerical simulations, considering non-ideal scenarios and accounting for external disturbances and uncertainties. Simulation results confirm that the proposed control strategy can effectively and robustly stabilize oversteer vehicles at high speeds, demonstrating the relevance of the approach for improving the safety and performance in automotive applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exponential and accelerated finite-time, as well as nearly fixed-time, stabilization of switched linear MIMO systems. The proposed approach relies on a generalized homogenization framework for switched linear systems and employs implicit Lyapunov functions for control design, covering both common and multiple Lyapunov function settings. Linear matrix equations and inequalities are derived to characterize the dilation generator and to synthesize the controller gains. Robustness of the resulting control laws with respect to system uncertainties and external disturbances is analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Automating the Wildfire Detection and Scheduling Pipeline with Maneuverable Earth Observation Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent, with potentially devastating consequences, including loss of life, infrastructure destruction, and severe environmental damage. Low Earth orbit satellites equipped with onboard sensors can capture critical imagery of active wildfires and enable real-time detection through machine learning algorithms applied to the acquired data. This paper presents a framework that automates the complete wildfire detection and scheduling pipeline, integrating three key components: wildfire detection in satellite imagery, statistical updating that incorporates data from repeated flyovers, and multi-satellite scheduling optimization. The framework enables wildfire detection using convolutional neural networks with sensor fusion techniques, the incorporation of subsequent flyover information using Bayesian statistics, and satellite scheduling through the state-of-the-art Reconfigurable Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem. Experiments conducted using real-world wildfire events and operational Earth observation satellites demonstrate that this autonomous detection and scheduling approach effectively enhances wildfire monitoring capabilities.</description>

      <title>Artificial Magnetic Conductor Frame to Improve Impedance Matching and Radiation Symmetry in 2$\times$2 Array for 6G Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) frame capable of improving the impedance matching of a 2$\times$2 array for 6G applications without degrading isolation performance is presented. The proposed frame is integrated into the array without modifying the single radiating element design. By relying on accurate full-wave simulations, it results that the addition of the frame restores the impedance matching performance, achieving a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz at 28 GHz. The isolation between each port remains under -15 dB within the operating band, thanks to the vias in the rectangular patch metasurface. Moreover, the overall structure exhibits a gain of 11.81 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 69$\%$, satisfactorily for broadband communication purposes. The proposed AMC frame represents an effective method for improving array performance without the need to alter the shape or dimensions of the single radiating element.</description>

      <title>Contraction Metric Based Safe Reinforcement Learning Force Control for a Hydraulic Actuator with Real-World Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force control in hydraulic actuators is notoriously difficult due to strong nonlinearities, uncertainties, and the high risks associated with unsafe exploration during learning. This paper investigates safe reinforcement learning (RL) for hy draulic force control with real-world training using contraction metric certificates. A data-driven model of a hydraulic actuator, identified from experimental data, is employed for simulation based pretraining of a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy that adapts the PI gains of a feedback-linearization (FL) controller. To reduce instability during online training, we propose a quadratic-programming (QP) contraction filter that leverages a learned contraction metric to enforce approximate exponential convergence of trajectories, applying minimal corrections to the policy output. The approach is validated on a hydraulic test bench, where the RL controller is trained directly on hardware and benchmarked against a simulation-trained agent and a fixed-gain baseline. Experimental results show that real-hardware training improves force-tracking performance compared to both alternatives, while the contraction filter mitigates chattering and instabilities. These findings suggest that contraction-based certificates can enable safe RL in high force hydraulic systems, though robustness at extreme operating conditions remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-Learned Vanishing Stacked Residual PINNs for Hyperbolic PDE State Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling distributed dynamical systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to discontinuities and shocks that hinder the convergence of traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recently proposed vanishing stacked residual PINN (VSR-PINN) embeds a vanishing-viscosity mechanism within stacked residual refinements to enable a smooth transition from the parabolic to hyperbolic regime. This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals. Numerical experiments on traffic reconstruction confirm that enforcing causality systematically reduces the median point-wise MSE and its variability across runs, yielding improvements of nearly one order of magnitude over non-causal training in both the baseline and PD variants.</description>

      <title>Airspace-aware Contingency Landing Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Systems In-Context: From Synthetic Data to Real-World Motor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities, but have not yet been extended to signal processing systems. Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Chlorination in Water Distribution Systems via Surrogate-assisted Neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the microbiological safety of large, heterogeneous water distribution systems (WDS) typically requires managing appropriate levels of disinfectant residuals including chlorine. WDS include complex fluid interactions that are nonlinear and noisy, making such maintenance a challenging problem for traditional control algorithms. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to this problem based on neuroevolution, multi-objective optimization, and surrogate modeling. Neural networks were evolved with NEAT to inject chlorine at strategic locations in the distribution network at select times. NSGA-II was employed to optimize four objectives: minimizing the total amount of chlorine injected, keeping chlorine concentrations homogeneous across the network, ensuring that maximum concentrations did not exceed safe bounds, and distributing the injections regularly over time. Each network was evaluated against a surrogate model, i.e. a neural network trained to emulate EPANET, an industry-level hydraulic WDS simulator that is accurate but infeasible in terms of computational cost to support machine learning. The evolved controllers produced a diverse range of Pareto-optimal policies that could be implemented in practice, outperforming standard reinforcement learning methods such as PPO. The results thus suggest a pathway toward improving urban water systems, and highlight the potential of using evolution with surrogate modeling to optimize complex real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Why Look at It at All?: Vision-Free Multifingered Blind Grasping Using Uniaxial Fingertip Force Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grasping under limited sensing remains a fundamental challenge for real-world robotic manipulation, as vision and high-resolution tactile sensors often introduce cost, fragility, and integration complexity. This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.</description>

      <title>NOMA-Assisted Multi-BS MEC Networks for Delay-Sensitive and Computation-Intensive IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3% and 14.7% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.</description>

      <title>Affine Transformable Unmanned Ground Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops the proof of concept for a novel affine transformable unmanned ground vehicle (ATUGV) with the capability of safe and aggressive deformation while carrying multiple payloads. The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Secure Connection Probability in MultiLayer Networks with Heterogeneous Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring physical-layer security in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is challenging due to their global coverage and multi-hop relaying across heterogeneous network layers, where the locations and channels of potential eavesdroppers are typically unknown. In this work, we derive a tractable closedform expression of the end-to-end secure connection probability (SCP) of multi-hop relay routes under heterogeneous Rician fading. The resulting formula shares the same functional form as prior Rayleigh-based approximations but for the coefficients, thereby providing analytical support for the effectiveness of heuristic posterior coefficient calibration adopted in prior work. Numerical experiments under various conditions show that the proposed scheme estimates the SCP with an 1%p error in most cases; and doubles the accuracy compared with the conventional scheme even in the worst case. As a case study, we apply the proposed framework to real-world space-air-groundsea integrated network dataset, showing that the derived SCP accurately captures observed security trends in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Leader-following Consensus over Jointly Connected Switching Networks is Achievable for Exponentially Unstable Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leader-following consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks has been a challenging problem and the solvability of the problem has been limited to the class of linear multi-agent systems whose system matrix is marginally stable. This condition is restrictive since it even excludes the most commonly used double-integrator system. This paper presents a breakthrough by demonstrating that leader-following exponential consensus is achievable for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. The degree of instability can be explicitly characterized by two key quantities that arise from the jointly connected condition on a switching graph. By exploiting duality, we further show that the output-based distributed observer design problem for a general leader system is solvable over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. This is also in sharp contrast to the existing distributed observers, which rely on the assumption that the leader system is marginally stable.</description>

      <title>Picasso: Holistic Scene Reconstruction with Physics-Constrained Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of occlusions and measurement noise, geometrically accurate scene reconstructions -- which fit the sensor data -- can still be physically incorrect. For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.</description>

      <title>Controlled Flight of an Insect-Scale Flapping-Wing Robot via Integrated Onboard Sensing and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial insects can effortlessly navigate dense vegetation, whereas similarly sized aerial robots typically depend on offboard sensors and computation to maintain stable flight. This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.</description>

      <title>Post-Collision Trajectory Restoration for a Single-track Ackermann Vehicle using Heuristic Steering and Tractive Force Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-collision trajectory restoration is a safety-critical capability for autonomous vehicles, as impact-induced lateral motion and yaw transients can rapidly drive the vehicle away from the intended path. This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of the CERN ATLAS ITk MOPS Readout: A Feasibility Study on Production and Development Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) necessitates a complete replacement of the ATLAS Inner Detector with the new Inner Tracker (ITk). This upgrade imposes stringent requirements on the associated Detector Control System (DCS), which is responsible for the monitoring, control, and safety of the detector. A critical component of the ITk DCS is the Monitoring of Pixel System (MOPS), which supervises the local voltages and temperatures of the new pixel detector modules. This paper introduces a dedicated testbed and verification methodology for the MOPS readout, defining a structured set of test cases for two DCS-readout architectures: a preliminary Raspberry Pi-based controller, the "MOPS-Hub Mock-up"(MH Mock-up), and the final production FPGA-based "MOPS-Hub" (MH). The methodology specifies the measurement chain for end-to-end latency, jitter, and data integrity across CAN and UART interfaces, including a unified time-stamping scheme, non-intrusive signal taps, and a consistent data-logging and analysis pipeline. This work details the load profiles and scalability scenarios (baseline operation, full-crate stress, and CAN Interface Card channel isolation), together with acceptance criteria and considerations for measurement uncertainty to ensure reproducibility. The objective is to provide a clear, repeatable procedure to qualify the MH architecture for production and deployment in the ATLAS ITk DCS. A companion paper will present the experimental results and the comparative analysis obtained using this testbed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08842v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As highly automated driving is transitioning from single-vehicle closed-access testing to commercial deployments of public ride-hailing in selected areas (e.g., Waymo), automated driving and connected cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) remain active fields of research. Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving. More impressions of karl. are available at https://karl.ac.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Pattern, Headway, and Fleet Size of Multiple Urban Transit Lines with Perceived Headway Consideration and Passenger Flow Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the urban transit pattern design problem, optimizing stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers, assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in Chicago, IL, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without additional operational costs.</description>

      <title>A General Nonlinear Observer Design for Inertial Navigation Systems with Almost Global Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies nonlinear observer design for rigid-body extended pose estimation using inertial measurements and generic exteroceptive sensing. The estimation problem is formulated as a cascade architecture that separates translational dynamics from rotational kinematics while preserving the geometric constraint of attitude evolution on $SO(3)$. By embedding the inertial navigation model into a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) representation, we construct an observer composed of a Kalman-Bucy-type estimator for translational states and an auxiliary unconstrained attitude variable, coupled with a nonlinear geometric reconstruction filter evolving on $SO(3)$. The cascade interconnection is analyzed within a nonlinear systems framework. We prove that uniform observability of the LTV subsystem guarantees almost global asymptotic stability of the overall nonlinear observer. For a benchmark GPS landmark aided configuration, explicit sufficient conditions on admissible trajectories are derived to ensure uniform observability. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation framework.</description>

Abstract: Extremum-seeking control (ESC) is widely used to optimize performance when the system dynamics are uncertain. However, sensitivity to sensor noise is a crucial issue in ESC implementation due to the use of high-pass filters or gradient estimators. To reduce the sensitivity of ESC to noise, this paper investigates the use of the recently developed adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) technique for numerical differentiation. In particular, this paper develops extremum-seeking control with adaptive input and state estimation (ESC/AISE), where AISE replaces the high-pass filter of ESC to improve performance under sensor noise. The effectiveness of ESC/AISE is illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Constraints from Stochastic Partially-Observed Closed-Loop Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for learning unknown parametric constraints from locally-optimal input-output trajectory data. We assume the data is generated by rollouts of stochastic nonlinear dynamics, under a single state or output feedback law and initial condition but distinct noise realizations, to robustly satisfy underlying constraints despite worst-case noise outcomes. We encode the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of this robust optimal feedback control problem within a feasibility problem to recover constraints consistent with the local optimality of the demonstrations. We prove that our constraint learning method (i) accurately recovers the demonstrator's policy, and (ii) conservatively estimates the set of policies that ensure constraint satisfaction despite worst-case noise realizations. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis, proving that when demonstrations are corrupted by transmission error, the inaccuracy in the learned feedback law scales linearly in the error magnitude. Empirically, our method accurately recovers unknown constraints from simulated noisy, closed-loop demonstrations generated using dynamics, both linear and nonlinear, (e.g., unicycle and quadrotor) and a range of feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities and the scenario approach, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.</description>

      <title>Decision-dependent Robust Charging Infrastructure Planning for Light-duty Truck Electrification at Industrial Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many industrial sites and digital logistics platforms rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport workers and small-scale facilities, which results in a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). To address this, we develop a robust model for planning charging infrastructure to electrify light-duty trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure selection (across multiple charger types and locations) and determines charging schedules for each truck based on the selected infrastructure. Given the strict stop times and schedules at industrial sites, we introduce a scheduling-with-abandonment problem in which trucks forgo charging if their waiting time exceeds a maximum threshold. We further incorporate the impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on drivers' waiting and abandonment behaviors. To model stochastic, heterogeneous parking durations, we classified trucks using machine learning (ML) methods based on contextual and time-location features. We then constructed decision-dependent, feature-driven robust uncertainty sets in which parking-time variability varies flexibly with drivers' charging choices. These feature-driven sets are applied to two robust optimization formulations with decision-dependent uncertainty (RO-DDU), resulting in distinct outcomes and managerial implications. We conduct a case study at an open-pit mining site to plan charger installations across eight charging zones, serving approximately 200 trucks. By decomposing the problem into a short rolling horizon or using a heuristic approach for the full-year or representative-day dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of less than 0.1\% under diverse uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a Ramanujan inner product and its corresponding norm, establishing a novel framework for the stability analysis of hybrid and discrete-time systems as an alternative to traditional Euclidean metrics. We establish new $\epsilon$-$\delta$ stability conditions that utilize the unique properties of Ramanujan summations and their relationship with number-theoretic concepts. The proposed approach provides enhanced robustness guarantees and reveals fundamental connections between system stability and arithmetic properties of the system dynamics. Theoretical results are rigorously proven, and simulation results on numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of Agentic EDA: A Survey of Autonomous Digital Chip Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry faces a critical "Productivity Gap" where design complexity outpaces human capacity. While the "AI for EDA" revolution (L2) successfully optimized specific point problems, a paradigm shift toward Agentic EDA (L3) is emerging, evolving from passive prediction to autonomous orchestration of the RTL-to-GDSII flow. This survey presents the first systematic framework for this transition, framing Agentic EDA not merely as "Chat with Tools," but as a Constrained Neuro-Symbolic Optimization problem. We propose a novel taxonomy rooted in a Cognitive Stack--Perception (aligning multimodal semantics), Cognition (planning under strict constraints), and Action (deterministic tool execution)--to dissect how probabilistic agents navigate zero-tolerance physical laws. Through this lens, we analyze the landscape: (1) in Frontend, the shift from one-shot generation to dual-loop syntactic-semantic repair; (2) in Backend, the dichotomy between algorithm-centric solvers and agent-centric orchestrators that treat executable code as a latent space. Finally, we critically examine the Trustworthiness gap, advocating for Sim-to-Silicon benchmarks and formal grounding to transform brittle prototypes into resilient engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Current and temperature imbalances in parallel-connected grid storage battery modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.</description>

      <title>Boundary adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction characteristics parameterized by a matrix of unknown coefficients appearing in the nonlinear (and possibly non-smooth) PDE source terms. Under appropriate assumptions of forward completeness and boundary sensing, an adaptive observer is synthesized to simultaneously estimate the lumped and distributed states, as well as the uncertain friction parameters, using only boundary measurements. The observer combines a finite-dimensional parameter estimator with an infinite-dimensional description of the state error dynamics, and achieves exponential convergence under persistent excitation. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in simulation by considering a relevant example borrowed from road vehicle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Safe Output Regulation of Strict-Feedback Linear Systems with Input Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven safe control framework for linear systems possessing a known strict-feedback structure, but with most plant parameters, external disturbances, and input delay being unknown. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, we utilize Krylov dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract the system dynamics from measured data, enabling the reconstruction of the system and disturbance matrices. Concurrently, the batch least-squares identification (BaLSI) method is employed to identify other unknown parameters in the input channel. Using control barrier functions (CBFs) and backstepping, we first develop a full-state safe controller. Based on this, we build an output-feedback controller by performing system identification using only the output data and actuation signals as well as constructing an observer to estimate the unmeasured plant states. The proposed approach achieves: 1) finite-time identification of a substantial set of unknown system quantities, and 2) exponential convergence of the output state (the state furthest from the control input) to a reference trajectory while rigorously ensuring safety constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a safe vehicle platooning application.</description>

      <title>An Ion-Intercalation Memristor for Enabling Full Parallel Writing in Crossbar Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures have long been seen as a promising foundation for in-memory computing, using memristor arrays for high-density, energy-efficient analog computation. However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Aware Frequency Regulation of a Heterogeneous Battery Fleet via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.
  Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.
  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Co-Design and Operation of Chiller and Thermal Energy Storage for Cost-Optimal HVAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrification of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft demands high-fidelity battery management systems capable of predicting voltage response under aggressive power dynamics. While data-driven models offer high accuracy, they often require complex architectures and extensive training data. Conversely, equivalent circuit models (ECMs), such as the second-order model, offer physical interpretability but struggle with high C-rate non-linearities. This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for the modelling of dependent random variables using generalised polynomial chaos. This allows to write chance-constrained optimization problems with respect to a joint distribution modelling dependencies between different stochastic inputs. Arbitrary dependencies are modelled by using Gaussian copulas to construct the joint distribution. The paper exploits the problem structure and develops suitable transformations to ensure tractability. The proposed method is applied to a probabilistic power reserve procurement problem. The effectiveness of the method to capture dependencies is shown by comparing the approach with a standard approach considering independent random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems. However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has been significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

      <description>arXiv:2401.15719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a non-asymptotic central limit theorem for vector-valued martingale differences using Stein's method, and use Poisson's equation to extend the result to functions of Markov Chains. We then show that these results can be applied to establish a non-asymptotic central limit theorem for Temporal Difference (TD) learning with averaging.</description>

      <title>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on explicit analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Under the constructed CBF, theoretical guarantees are established regarding system safety and the Lipschitz continuity of the control inputs. Furthermore, incremental update theorems are provided, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving computational speeds significantly faster than baseline methods while ensuring the system safely reaches its target position.</description>

      <title>Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>A Saddle Point Algorithm for Robust Data-Driven Factor Model Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the factor model problem, which aims to uncover low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional datasets. Adopting a robust data-driven approach, we formulate the problem as a saddle-point optimization. Our primary contribution is a first-order algorithm that solves this reformulation by leveraging a linear minimization oracle (LMO). We further develop semi-closed form solutions (up to a scalar) for three specific LMOs, corresponding to the Frobenius norm, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Gelbrich (aka Wasserstein) distance. The analysis includes explicit quantification of these LMOs' regularity conditions, notably the Lipschitz constants of the dual function, which govern the algorithm's convergence performance. Numerical experiments confirm our method's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings, outperforming standard off-the-shelf optimization solvers.</description>

      <title>Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration</description>

      <title>Graphon Mean-Field Logit Dynamic: Derivation, Computation, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graphon mean-field logit dynamic, a stationary mean-field game based on logit interactions. This dynamic emerges from a stochastic control problem involving a continuum of nonexchangeable and interacting agents and reduces to solving a continuum of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations connected through a graphon that models the connections among agents. Using a fixed-point argument, we prove that this HJB system admits a unique solution in the space of bounded functions when the discount rate is high (i.e., agents are myopic). Under certain assumptions, we also establish regularity properties of the system, such as equi-continuity. We propose a finite difference scheme for computing the HJB system and prove the uniqueness and existence of its numerical solutions. The mean-field logit dynamic is applied to a case study on inland fisheries resource management in the upper Tedori River of Japan. A series of computational cases are then conducted to investigate the dependence of the dynamic on both the discount rate and graphon.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>Collaborative-Online-Learning-Enabled Distributionally Robust Motion Control for Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel COllaborative-Online-Learning (COOL)-enabled motion control framework for multi-robot systems to avoid collision amid randomly moving obstacles whose motion distributions are partially observable through decentralized data streams. To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the local Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods accurately inferred constraints and designed safe interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Obstacle-free Trajectory Planning for UAVs in an Unknown Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</description>
