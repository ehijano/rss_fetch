      <title>High-dimensional dynamical systems: co-existence of attractors, phase transitions, maximal Lyapunov exponent and response to periodic drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of a broad class of high-dimensional random dynamical systems exhibiting chaotic as well as fixed point and periodic attractors. We consider cases in which attractors can co-exists in some regions of the phase diagrams and we characterize their nature by computing the maximal Lyapunov exponent. For a specific choice of the dynamical system we show that this quantity can be computed explicitly in the whole chaotic phase due to an underlying integrability of a properly defined Schr\"odinger problem. Furthermore, we consider the response of this dynamical systems to periodic perturbations. We show that these dynamical systems act as filters in the frequency-amplitude spectrum of the periodic forcing: only in some regions of the frequency-amplitude plane the periodic forcing leads to a synchronization of the dynamics. All in all, the results that we present mirror closely the ones observed in the past forty years in the study of standard models of random recurrent neural networks. However, the dynamical systems that we consider are easier to study and we believe that this may be an advantage if one wants to go beyond random dynamical systems and consider specific training strategies.</description>

      <title>Competing Localizations on Disordered Non-Hermitian Random Graph Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in one-dimensional lattice systems are well established and have been extensively studied within both Hermitian and non-Hermitian frameworks. In this work, we extend this understanding to a more general setting by investigating localization and delocalization transitions and the behavior of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) using a tight binding model on a generalized random graph lattice. Our model incorporates three key parameters, asymmetric hopping $\Delta$, on site disorder $W$, and a random long-range coupling $p$ that render the underlying nature of random graph. By varying $p,$ $\Delta$ and the disorder, we explore the interplay between topology, randomness, and non-Hermiticity in determining localization properties. Our results show the competition between skin effect driven and Anderson driven localizations in the parameter regimes. Despite the presence of large disorder, the skin effect driven localization coexists with Anderson driven localization.</description>

      <title>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives rise to topological insulators which are robust against sufficiently weak randomness inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation into a trivial insulator. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square-lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Are Neural Networks Collision Resistant?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Replicated liquid theory in $1+\infty$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</description>
