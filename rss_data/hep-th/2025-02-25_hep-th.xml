      <title>Renormalization group of the gravity coupled with the scalar theory and its effective normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normalization of the quantum corrected action is resolving the equation divergent dependence of the cutoff towards the system apparent result in quantum gravity. Here we consider the normalization to Einstein R twice scalar action with the cutoff runs from apparent infrared momentu to the ultraviolet momentum. These gravitational actions, Einstein R twice and Einstein R twice with the scalar theory, are come to the ensured apparent system recommendations in classical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Conformal defects and RG flows in ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects play a central role in many contexts, from condensed matter to quantum gravity. The situations in which the bulk theory is conformal and the defect inherits part of this symmetry -- the so-called defect conformal field theories (dCFTs) -- have recently received a lot of attention, also thanks to new powerful methods to tackle them, like supersymmetric localization, integrability or the bootstrap. A dCFT may be deformed by turning on marginally relevant operators, which trigger RG flows connecting different fixed points. A natural arena where this phenomenon can be explored are 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theories coupled to matter. These are in fact known to display a plethora of Wilson loops that can be used to define 1-dimensional dCFTs living on their contours. Here we discuss a few examples from an intricate web of RG flows connecting the dCFTs defined on the BPS and non-BPS Wilson loops of ABJM theory. We compute the anomalous dimensions of the deforming operators, establish g-theorems along the flows, and also discuss the role played by cohomological anomalies and framing.</description>

      <title>The heterotic $G_2$ moduli space metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we dimensionally reduce a heterotic supergravity on a $G_2$ background with Minkowski spacetime using a certain cohomology as a basis for the Kaluza-Klein expansion, up to and including first order in $\alpha'$. We construct the moduli space heterotic $G_2$ compactifications. The $\alpha'$-correction induces a curvature correction to the Weyl-Peterson metric. In the limit in which the $G_2$ manifold reduces to $SU(3)$, we recover known results.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotic safety in 4D gauge theory with additional dimension=4 operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interacting fixed points of simple quantum field theory in four-dimensional $SU(N_c)$ coupled to $N_f$ species of color fermions and $N_f^2$ colorless scalars in the Veneziano limit. Using the rich structure of all possible quartic scalar operators, we find an interacting conformal fixed point with stable vacua and crossovers inbetween. We perform calculations in perturbation theory up to four loop in the gauge and three loop in the Yukawa and scalar couplings. We also consider anomalous dimensions for fields, scalar mass squared, and a class of dimension-three operators.</description>

      <title>The influence of Wilson lines on heavy quark anti-quark potential and mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic heavy quark potential is investigated via holographic Wilson loops in the AdS soliton with gauge potential. We analyze two types of holographic Wilson loops. {In the first type, holographic heavy quark potential shows the area law behavior. In the second type, the potential becomes zero at a critical length and physics analogous to the dissociation occurs. The mass of heavy quarkonia and the binding energy are examined.} Lastly, the mass of $0^{++}$ glueball-like operators dual to massless dilaton is calculated. The mass of $0^{++}$ glueball-like operator decreases with increase of the gauge potential as expected in arXiv:2309.03491 [hep-th]. The results are comparable with lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strenghts has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems about the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also proved.</description>

      <title>Non(anti)Commutative Superspace, Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Closed Forms, and Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from an elementary calculation of super Lie group elements associating with non(anti)-commutative Grassmann parameters, we derive several closed expressions of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula which represent multiplication properties of super Lie group elements in the corresponding superspace. We then show that parametrization of superspace in general may become infinite dimensional due to the presence of non(anti)commutativity. We show that a Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted SUSY Algebra (also referred to as Marcus B-type Twisted SUSY Algebra or Geometric Langlands Twisted SUSY Algebra) with a certain type of deformation, which we call an exponential deformation, may circumvent this problem. We also provide, in terms of gauge covariantization of the SUSY algebra, a geometric understanding of the exponential deformation, and see that the framework constructed in this paper may serve as a non(anti)commutative superspace framework providing the gauge covariant link formulation of twisted super Yang-Mills on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure of Higher Curvature Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the causal structure of Generalized Quadratic Gravity (GQG) and Einsteinian Cubic Gravity (ECG). It is well known that gravitons in higher-curvature theories can exhibit superluminal propagation, rendering the conventional definition of causal structures based on null curves inadequate. Instead, the causal structure must be defined using the fastest propagating modes, which travel along characteristic surfaces. The superluminal propagation in higher-curvature theories has significant implications for black holes. Specifically, if the Killing horizon of a black hole is not a characteristic surface corresponding to the fastest propagating mode, the horizon can no longer function as a causal barrier. Our analysis demonstrates that GQG with a genuine fourth-order equation of motion possesses only null characteristics, implying that the horizon is a characteristic surface. Furthermore, we perform a detailed characteristic analysis of ECG. We show that while all null surfaces are characteristic surfaces in ECG, the converse is not true - there exist non-null characteristic surfaces. In particular, we identify a non-null characteristic surface in a Type N spacetime in the algebraic classification of spacetimes. Despite the existence of multiple characteristic surfaces in ECG, we establish that the black hole horizon remains a characteristic surface.</description>

      <title>Puzzles in 3D Off-Shell Geometries via VTQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Particle Production without Quantum Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a cosmological setting, particle production is ubiquitous. It may occur as a consequence of the expansion of the background or because a field couples to other degrees of freedom that evolve with time. The process is well understood in the context of quantum field theory, and calculable as long as the produced quanta are weakly interacting. For extended objects like strings and membranes a second quantized formulation is much less developed than for particles. In this light, we revisit particle production from a first quantized perspective. We show how to obtain occupation numbers, both from the vacuum persistence amplitude and from the Green's function. We also derive the much less studied but phenomenologically interesting two-particle wavefunction of the produced quanta.</description>

      <title>A duality of Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces inside and outside the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surfaces associated with timelike subregions in static spacetimes with a horizon. These RT surfaces can extend into the horizon, allowing us to probe the interior of the black hole. The horizon typically divides the RT surface into two distinct parts. We demonstrate that the area of the RT surface inside the horizon can be reconstructed from the contributions of the RT surfaces outside the horizon, along with additional RT surfaces for spacelike subregions that are causally related to the timelike subregions. This result provides a concrete realization of black hole complementarity, where the information from the black hole interior can be reconstructed from the degrees of freedom outside the horizon.</description>

      <title>Bound states around vacuum in scalar ModMax model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a two-dimensional scalar field model inspired by the dimensional reduction of a four-dimensional ModMax theory. Upon projecting out the 4D theory down to a 2D theory we obtain a theory which presents a constant electric field and two scalar fields. In order to investigate kinks, we include the presence of a potential and consider the static case with one of the fields in the vacuum, showing that the solutions for the non-uniform field can be mapped into the ones arising from the canonical model. By studying the linear stability of the model, we show that fluctuations around the uniform field are described by a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation whose weight function depends on the non-uniform solution and the parameter of the ModMax model. Remarkably, the presence of the aforementioned weight may bring bound states to light, contrary to what occurs in the canonical model.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariant Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the long-standing problem of gauge dependence of the effective potential arises due to the factorisation of the determinant of operators, which is invalid when we take the zeta-regularised trace of the operators. We show by correcting for this assumption by computing the multiplicative anomaly, the gauge-dependent terms of the effective potential cancel. We also show that in two- and odd-dimensional non-compact spacetime manifolds where the multiplicative anomaly term is zero, the standard calculation of one-loop effective potential gives a gauge-independent result. These results are in support of our claim that the multiplicative anomaly may play a crucial role in removing the gauge dependence in the effective potential in the four-dimensional non-compact manifold. Noting the non-trivial aspects of this anomaly computation for a generic scenario, we propose the Heat-Kernel method to compute the effective potential where this anomaly emerges as a total derivative, thus redundant. We explicitly show how one can calculate the gauge independent, effective action and the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential by employing the Heat-Kernel method. Based on this result, we advocate the Heat-Kernel expansion as the most straightforward method, as it naturally deals with the matrix elliptic operator for the calculation of manifestly gauge independent, effective actions compared to other conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Saturation of Black Hole Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic complexity of a static spherically symmetric black hole, defined as the volume of an extremal surface, grows linearly with time at late times in general relativity. The growth comes from a region at a constant transverse area inside the black hole and continues forever in the classical theory. In this region the volume complexity of any spherically symmetric black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions reduces to a geodesic length in an effective two-dimensional JT-gravity theory. The length in JT-gravity has been argued to saturate at very late times via non-perturbative corrections obtained from a random matrix description of the gravity theory. The same argument, applied to our effective JT-gravity description of the volume complexity, leads to complexity saturation at times of exponential order in the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a $d+1$-dimensional black hole. Along the way, we explore a simple toy model for complexity growth, based on a discretisation of Nielsen complexity geometry, that can be analytically shown to exhibit the expected late-time complexity saturation.</description>

      <title>The large-charge expansion in nonrelativistic conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal field theories (CFTs) are associated with critical phenomena and phase transitions and also play an essential role in string theory. Solving a CFT is an extremely constrained problem due to conformal invariance -- the task essentially reduces to the computation of a set of numbers called the CFT data -- yet it remains highly nontrivial. In fact, CFTs usually are strongly coupled and thus require new tools that do not rely on perturbation theory. For these reasons, in the past few decades, they became one of the most active fields of research. A natural extension of these ideas with far-reaching implications for condensed matter systems -- in which relativistic effects are not manifest -- is to replace the Poincare group by the Galilean group, thereby opening the way to a precise formulation of a whole new class of critical phenomena in terms of nonrelativistic conformal field theories (NRCFTs). Many of the aforementioned tools developed to gain a better formal understanding of CFTs can then be adapted to gain a strong predictive power in systems with direct experimental relevance. In recent years, a new powerful tool has emerged: the large-charge expansion. It allows to systemically uncover part of the CFT data of theories with global symmetries, thereby revealing profound and universal features of these systems. Using the state-operator correspondence, most of the computations are further reduced to the evaluation of energy levels in a finite-density system described by a large-charge effective field theory, usually associated with a conformal superfluid phase. The large-charge dynamics in the nonrelativistic case is however richer -- and therefore, more challenging -- than its relativistic counterpart. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress which opened the door to many new exciting large-charge applications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics, focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted theoretical physics research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them. The public problems and solutions, results for various models, and updates to the data set and score distribution, are available on the website of the dataset tpbench.org.</description>

      <title>Entropic force and bouncing behaviour in $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the entropic force description of gravity into $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time and derive the $\kappa$-deformed corrections to the Newton's gravitational force. Using this we show the appearance of logarithmic correction as the first order $\kappa$-deformed correction term to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Further we also derive the $\kappa$-deformed Friedmann equations and study the evolution of scale factor in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. Finally we show that the $\kappa$-deformation parameter avoids the initial singularity in early universe by providing a bounce behaviour for the case of spatially flat and closed universe.</description>

      <title>Functional Determinants for False Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive simple expressions to regularise functional determinants from fluctuations of fields with spin 0, 1/2, and 1. These are important for the precise dimensionful determination of false vacuum decay rates. We work in $D = 4$ Euclidean dimensions and use familiar Feynman diagrammatic techniques with a double expansion in interactions and masses, together with dimensional regularisation in momentum space. We Fourier transform to coordinate space and end up with a simple prescription in terms of single integrals over the Euclidean radius of field-dependent masses and their derivatives. Our results apply to models with an arbitrary scalar potential and with any number of scalars, fermions, gauge bosons and associated ghosts. We exemplify this approach on the Standard Model with a streamlined derivation of fluctuation determinants.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Corrections to Quark TMDPDFs in the Background-Field Method: Gauge Invariance, Equations of Motion, and Multiple Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>

      <title>Calculating the EFT likelihood via saddle-point expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the functional approach for calculating the EFT likelihood by applying the saddle-point expansion. We demonstrate that, after suitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path integral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In contrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point expansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the treatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at the saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood calculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through the combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. Gaussian distribution as a working example, we then concentrate on the calculation of the EFT likelihood and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood via saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise computation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby enabling more reliable theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, we explain why the quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class, even if the various gauge transformations apparently have different asymptotic rates of convergence. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

      <title>Dirac-isotonic oscillators in (1 + 1) and (2 + 1) dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the Dirac oscillator in $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$ dimensions and present its generalizations in the spirit of the isotonic oscillator. In $(1+1)$ dimensions, the Dirac oscillator returns to quantum harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, while its generalization maps to the isotonic oscillator. We describe exact solutions of these generalized systems and also present their non-relativistic limits. Finally, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we show that a generalized Dirac oscillator in $(2+1)$ dimensions can be mapped to an anti-Jaynes-Cummings-like Hamiltonian in which the spin operators couple with the supercharges.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic construction of the $\mathbb{H}^3$-Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory and correspondence with Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models are among the most basic and most studied Conformal Field Theories (CFT). They have had a huge influence not only in physics but also in mathematics, in representation theory and geometry. However their rigorous probabilistic construction and analysis starting from the path integral is still missing and all their properties have been obtained algebraically from their postulated affine Lie algebra symmetry. Initially considered as taking values in a compact semisimple Lie Group G, the WZW model also has a "dual" formulation where the group $G$ is replaced by the homogenous space $G^{\mathbb{C}}/G$, where $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ is the complexification of $G$, and it has been argued that the former can be (re-)constructed from the latter. For $G={\rm SU}(2)$, the space ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/{\rm SU}(2)$ can be identified with the three dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and, in physics, the corresponding CFT has been studied as the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A surprising correspondence between the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW CFT and the Liouville CFT was found by Ribault and Teschner and later generalised by Hikida and Shomerus. This correspondence has been dubbed by Gaiotto-Teschner as the "quantum analytic Langlands correspondence" since the analytic Langlands correspondence of Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan seems to emerge in its formal semi classical limit. In this paper we give a rigorous construction of the path integral for the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW model on a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$, twisted by an arbitrary smooth gauge field on $\Sigma$. Using the probabilistic path integral we prove a correspondence between the correlation functions of the primary fields of the $\mathbb{H}^3$ model and those of Liouville CFT extending the expressions proposed by Ribault-Teschner and by Hikida-Schomerus to this general setup.</description>

Abstract: In part I: We find a series physical scales such as 1) Planck scale, 2) Minimal approximate grand unification SU(5), 3) the mass scale of the see saw model right handed or Majorana neutrinoes, some invented scale with many scalar bosons, etc., and get the logarithms of these energy scales fitted by a quantity q related to the dimensions of to thescales related dimensionalities of coefficients in Lagrangian densities,or some generalization of this q to something similar in the variouscases of the scales. The logarithm of the energies behave as a straight line versus the dimension related number q. This is being explained by an ontologically existing lattice, which fluctuates in lattice canstant a from place to place in space time or more precisely, it fluctuates quantum mechanically. In Part II: We find a fitting of the three fine structure constantsin the Standard Model by means of a no-susy and SU(5)-like - but only accurately SU(5) symmetric in the classical approximation - by means of three other parameters for each of which, however, we have speculative predictions: Quantum corrections due to the lattice whichare three times as large as naive quantum corrections, because the lattice is supposed to lie in layers, one layer for each fermion-family; criticallity of the unified coupling, using the satnadrd model group S(U (2) x U (3)); the unification scale is fitted inot the scale-system of part I</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques of p-adic analysis, it is possible to formulate a rigorous version of the quantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, consistent with the existence of the Planck length. Such a model cannot be formulated if we use R^{3} as a model for physical space. The experimental testability of physical theories at the Planck scale is currently impossible. Here, we provide an indirect, theoretical argument that shows that the p-adic QM has physical content. We show that a large class of Schr\"odinger equations describes the scaling limits of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs (stochastic automata). These quantum walks appear as fundamental tools in quantum computing. We conjecture that this interpretation is valid in a general framework. The `new theory' does not have Lorentz symmetry, and the Einstein causality is violated. This fact does not contradict the so-called no-communication theorem; such a result requires as a primary hypothesis that R^{4} be a valid model for space-time at the Planck scale. Thus, the no-communication theorem under the discreteness of the space is an open problem.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel mechanism for dark matter production through the formation of light black holes from the collapse of dark baryons in confining SU(N) gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. While glueballs and mesons cannot form black holes under physically reasonable conditions, we prove that for appropriate ranges of the confinement scale, quark masses, number of colors $N$, and dark sector temperature, dark baryons can produce Planck-scale black hole relics in the early universe. Assuming the relics are stable, the abundance of both the dark baryon black hole population directly arising at confinement and that frozen in from dark glueball and meson pair annihilation are exponentially suppressed in $N$, leading to an upper limit $N\lesssim 100$ and of a few hundreds Planck units in mass for models where the black hole relics are the entirety of the dark matter. We present a detailed numerical study of the parameter space where this scenario is realized.</description>

      <title>Constraining a scalar dark matter component through anomalous stellar light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)] a baryogenesis scenario was proposed where our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. This model introduced a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, it is shown that this boson can exist today as a relic from the Big Bang and constitute a minor dark matter component. Additionally, one identifies a one-loop process that allows for a non-zero, albeit very small, photon-boson scattering amplitude. One explores this phenomenon and suggests that observations of a subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could constrain the properties of the scalar boson. These constraints would, in turn, provide valuable insights into the parameters of the proposed baryogenesis model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the BPS invariants associated with framed links. We extend the relationship between the algebraic curve (i.e. dual $A$-polynomial) and the BPS invariants of a knot investigated in \cite{GKS} to the case of a framed knot. With the help of the framing change formula for the dual $A$-polynomial of a framed knot, we give several explicit formulas for the extremal $A$-polynomials and the BPS invariants of framed knots. As to the framed links, we present several numerical calculations for the Ooguri-Vafa invariants and BPS invariants for framed Whitehead links and Borromean rings and verify the integrality property for them.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Space Symmetry and Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On one hand, the concept of Quantum Phase Space which is compatible with the uncertainty principle has been considered recently. It has also been shown that a natural symmetry that can be associated with this quantum phase space is the symmetry corresponding to Linear Canonical Transformations (LCTs). On the other hand, sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles that are expected to be important for the understanding of physics beyond the current standard model of particle physics. The existence of these particles are suggested both from theoretical and experimental sides. In this work, the objective is to discuss about the symmetry of quantum phase space corresponding to the LCT group and its relation to the possible existence of sterile neutrinos. It is shown that the spin representation of the LCT group associated to the quantum phase, for a signature (1, 4), suggests the existence of sterile neutrinos and lead to a new way for describing them. The mathematical formalism developed in this work provides a new framework for the study of neutrinos physics.</description>

      <title>Callan-Rubakov effects in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Callan-Rubakov effect describes monopole-catalyzed proton decay. While this effect is fundamental for quantum field theories, its experimental observation has remained far from reality. Here, we reveal a similar, but experimentally reachable, defect-catalysis of the quantum anomaly in topological materials. In particular, surface Dirac fermions on topological insulators develop a distinct localized state at the position of dislocations or $\pi$-fluxes, which mediates spin-flip time-reversal breaking scattering or absorption of electrons. Despite the Hermiticity of topological insulators, a non-Hermitian topological number guarantees the robust existence of the localized state. Our finding implies that non-magnetic defects may behave like magnetic impurities on surfaces of topological insulators. Using the K-theory classification, we generalize this condensed-matter version of the Callan-Rubakov effect to other classes of topological materials.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parameterized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} [1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]^{-1}$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that the singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime for the perfectly resolved case $\alpha &gt; 1$. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including \alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential. In this article we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of Hardon Resonance Gas (HRG) models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>A Multipole-Based Framework for Kerr Black Hole Mimickers: From General Construction to a Specific Case of Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for constructing solutions to the Einstein equations with an arbitrary multipolar structure, providing a systematic method to identify physically reasonable energy-momentum tensors that source black hole mimickers. As an example, we investigate an anisotropic fluid with a gaussian-like energy-density profile that, at linearized level, satisfies all energy and causality conditions while producing a gravitational field with the exact same multipolar structure as Kerr black holes. In the spinless case, we obtain a fully non-perturbative solution that, depending on the parameter choices, describes either a horizonless Schwarzschild mimicker or a static regular black hole model with a resolved curvature singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five-point functions and five-body wave functions play an important role in many areas of nuclear and particle physics, e.g., in 2 -&gt; 3 scattering processes, in the five-gluon vertex, or in the study of pentaquarks. In this work we consider the permutation group S5 to facilitate the description of such objects. We work out the multiplets transforming under irreducible representations of S5 and provide compact formulas allowing one to cast the permutations of an object $f_{12345}$ into combinations with definite permutation symmetry. We also give the explicit expressions for the irreducible multiplet products. We consider several practical applications as examples: We arrange the four-momenta and Lorentz invariants of a five-point function into the multiplet structure, we work out the color tensors of the five-gluon vertex in the multiplet notation, and we discuss applications for five-body wave functions like those of pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Gray-body factors: Method matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, without the need for additional mechanisms. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model. While this analysis serves as a first step in testing the scenario, we emphasize the importance of considering this effect, as it is naturally expected to be present and could offer valuable insights in light of the recent observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use commutativity of null-integrated operators on the same null plane to construct dispersive CFT sum rules for spinning operators. The contribution of heavy blocks to these sum rules is dominated by a saddle configuration that we call the "scattering crystal." Correlators in this configuration have a natural flat-space interpretation, which allows us to build a dictionary between dispersive CFT sum rules for stress-tensors and flat-space dispersion relations for gravitons. This dictionary is a crucial step for establishing the HPPS conjecture for stress tensor correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-point correlation function of a massive field $\langle\chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle$, measured along an observer's worldline in de Sitter (dS), decays exponentially as $\tau \to \infty$. Meanwhile, every dS observer is surrounded by a horizon and the holographic interpretation of the horizon entropy $S_{\rm dS}$ suggests that the correlation function should stop decaying, and start behaving erratically at late times. We find evidence for this expectation in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity by finding a topologically nontrivial saddle, which is suppressed by $e^{-S_{\rm dS}}$, and which gives a constant contribution to $|\langle \chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle|^2$. This constant might have the interpretation of the late-time average of $|\langle \chi(\tau)\chi(0)\rangle|^2$ over all microscopic theories that have the same low-energy effective description.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering in Effective Field Theory: a Scalar Tidal Matching at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravitational analog of the Raman process, a quasi-elastic scattering of waves off compact objects, in worldline effective field theory (EFT). As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our results pave the way for systematic calculations of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.</description>

Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

Abstract: This work aims to explore the holographic dual of the thermodynamics of 4-D dyonic AdS black holes within the AdS/CFT correspondence framework. With the alterations in $\Lambda$ as cosmological constant and $G_N$ as Newton's constant, the AdS black hole thermodynamics can be extended. This relates to incorporating the $C$ as CFT central charge and $\mu$ as its chemical potential to the standard pairs of $(T, S)$ that is temperature vs. entropy, and $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as field theory pressure vs. volume as a pair in the dual CFT for conjugate thermodynamic variables. We explore the dyonic system which is rich in phase transitions so the traditional pairs for potential and charges become $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ as electric potential and charge and $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$ as magnetic potential and charge. Exploration of all the 16 ensembles, showed that some show interesting phase behaviour and criticality in some ensembles like $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$ where we get a number of phase transitions and criticality namely Van der Waals, Superfluid $\lambda$ and Davies type where Davies type is missing in the last ensemble. In ensembles $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,\mathcal{V},\mu)$, we see only a Davies type phase transitions. In ensemble $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_e,\tilde{\Phi}_m,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,p,\mu)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,p,C)$, $(\tilde{Q}_m,\tilde{Q}_e,p,\mu)$ we see no criticality but we do see Davies type phase transition. In ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_m,\tilde{\Phi}_e,\mathcal{V},C)$, we see a confined/deconfined and Davies-type phase transition.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Symmetries in the TsT/$T\bar{T}$ Correspondence</title>

Abstract: Starting from holography for IIB string theory on AdS$_3\times \mathcal N$ with NS-NS flux, the TsT/$T\bar T$ correspondence is a conjecture that a TsT transformation on the string theory side is holographically dual to the single-trace version of the $T\bar T$ deformation on the field theory side. More precisely, the long string sector of string theory on the TsT-transformed background corresponds to the symmetric product theory whose seed theory is the $T\bar T$-deformed CFT$_2$. In this paper, we study the asymptotic symmetry of the string theory in the bulk. We find a state-dependent, non-local field redefinition under which the worldsheet equations of motion, stress tensor, as well as the symplectic form of string theory after the TsT transformation are mapped to those before the TsT transformation. The asymptotic symmetry in the auxiliary AdS basis is generated by two commuting Virasoro generators, while in the TsT transformed basis is non-linear and non-local. Our result from string theory analysis is compatible with that of the $T\bar T$ deformed CFT$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correlators of three single-trace operators in Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory from the perspective of integrable boundary states. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where two operators being $1/3$-BPS and the entire correlation function is considered within the twisted-translated frame. The correlator can be expressed as the overlap between a boundary state and a Bethe state. It is found that the boundary state formed by the two $1/3$-BPS operators is integrable only when the number of Wick contractions between the non-BPS operator and one of the $1/3$-BPS operators is 0 or 1. We compute the overlaps for the integrable cases utilizing the symmetries preserved by the correlators.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative approach for scalar particle production in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative production of scalar particles within the Higgs-$R^2$ inflation model, focusing on a massive spectator field that interacts gravitationally via a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar $R$. By transforming the model to the Einstein frame, where direct couplings between inflationary dynamics and the spectator field emerge, we analyze both perturbative and non-perturbative particle production. We solve the spectator field equation numerically, using the Bogolyubov transformation, to calculate the comoving particle density. Our findings indicate that particle production occurs for light particles with conformal coupling and for masses $m_\chi &gt; M/2$ in the minimally coupled scenario.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal coupling of supersymmetric SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the off-diagonal coupling between two supersymmetric SYK models, which preserves both supersymmetry and solvability. We found that the interaction terms of the $N=2$ supersymmetric SYK have a holographic interpretation as a possible supersymmetric traversable wormhole. First we introduce the coupling in the trivial Homologic $N=1$ SYK model as a simplified example. Similar couplings can be implied in $N=2$ chiral SYK model with BPS states. We propose a special form of $N=4$ SYK by introducing supermultiplets, and which also naturally include the coupling terms. The holographic picture of $N=4$ SYK does not have an eternal solution in the low energy limit. And the effective actions are studied in both thermal limit and low energy limit. We also investigate the SYK-like thermal field double states of the supersymmetric SYK and the transmission amplitude between single-side $N=2$ models in Lorentz time. Additionally, the multi-side $N=2,4$ OTOCs are also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper classifies all Higgs branch Higgsing patterns for simply-laced unitary quiver gauge theories with eight supercharges (including multiple loops) and introduces a Higgs branch subtraction algorithm. All possible minimal transitions are given, identifying differences between slices that emerge on the Higgs and Coulomb branches. In particular, the algorithm is sensitive to global information including monodromies and Namikawa-Weyl groups. Guided by symplectic duality, the algorithm further determines the global symmetry on the Coulomb branch, and verifies the exclusion of $C$ type or $F_4$ global symmetry for (simply-laced) unitary quiver gauge theories. The Higgs branches of some unitary quivers are verified to give slices in the nilpotent cones of exceptional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity and the emergence of local algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theories of gravity are generally expected to have some degree of non-locality, with familiar local physics emerging only in a particular limit. Perturbative quantum gravity around backgrounds with isometries and compact Cauchy slices provides an interesting laboratory in which this emergence can be explored. In this context, the remaining isometries are gauge symmetries and, as a result, gauge-invariant observables cannot be localized. Instead, local physics can arise only through certain relational constructions.
  We explore such issues below for perturbative quantum gravity around de Sitter space. In particular, we describe a class of gauge-invariant observables which, under appropriate conditions, provide good approximations to certain algebras of local fields. Our results suggest that, near any minimal $S^d$ in dS$_{d+1}$, this approximation can be accurate only over regions in which the corresponding global time coordinate $t$ spans an interval $\Delta t \lesssim O(\ln G^{-1})$. In contrast, however, we find that the approximation can be accurate over arbitrarily large regions of global dS$_{d+1}$ so long as those regions are located far to the future or past of such a minimal $S^d$. This in particular includes arbitrarily large parts of any static patch.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of holographic superfluids from planar topology to spherical topology, inspired by recent studies on Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) on shell-shaped geometry. We investigate the superfluid phase transition from normal fluid and its Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) on the sphere. It turns out that the critical temperature for the superfluid phase transition on the sphere is higher than that in the planar case. We investigated four different solutions in the backgrounds of large and small black holes. The calculation of free energy selects the most stable solution. Finally, after calculating the quasi-normal modes and their dynamic behavior, we obtained three different channels similar to the planar superfluid case, along with the ``first" hydrodynamic excitation mode.</description>

Abstract: Minimal unitary representation of $SO(d,2)$ and its deformations describe all the conformally massless fields in $d$ dimensional Minkowskian spacetimes. In critical dimensions these spacetimes admit extensions with twistorial coordinates plus a dilatonic coordinate to causal spacetimes coordinatized by Jordan algebras $J_3^{A}$ of degree three over the four division algebras $A= R , C , H , O $. We study the minimal unitary representation (minrep) of the conformal group $E_{7(-25)}$ of the spacetime coordinatized by the exceptional Jordan algebra $J_3^{O}$. We show that the minrep of $E_{7(-25)}$ decomposes into infinitely many massless representations of the conformal group $SO(10,2)$. Corresponding conformal fields transform as symmetric tensors in spinor indices of $SO(9,1)$ subject to certain constraints. Even and odd tensorial fields describe bosonic and fermionic conformal fields, respectively. Each irrep of $SO(10,2)$ falls into a unitary representation of an $SU(1,1)$ subgroup that commutes with $SO(10,2)$. The noncompact generators in spinor representation $16 $ of $SO(10)$ interpolate between the bosonic and fermionic representations and hence act like "bosonic supersymmetry" generators. We also give the decomposition of the minrep of $E_{7(-25)}$ with respect to the subgroup $SO^*(12)\times SU(2)$ with $SO^*(12) $ acting as the conformal group of the spacetime coordinatized by $J_3^{H}$. Group $E_{7(-25)}$ is also the U-duality group of the exceptional $N=2$ Maxwell-Einstein supergravity in four dimensions. We discuss the relevance of our results to the composite scenario that was proposed for the exceptional supergravity so as to accommodate the families of quarks and leptons of the standard model as well as to the proposal that $E_{7(-25)}$ acts as spectrum generating symmetry group of the $5d$ exceptional supergravity</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Celestial Quantum Error Correction II: From Qudits to Celestial CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A holographic CFT description of asymptotically flat spacetimes inherits vacuum degeneracies and IR divergences from its gravitational dual. We devise a Quantum Error Correcting (QEC) framework to encode both effects as correctable fluctuations on the CFT dual. The framework is physically motivated by embedding a chain of qudits in the so-called Klein spacetime and then taking a continuum $N\to \infty$ limit. At finite $N$ the qudit chain 1) enjoys a discrete version of celestial symmetries and 2) supports a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. The limit results in hard states with quantized BMS hair in the celestial torus forming the logical subspace, robust under errors induced by soft radiation. Technically, the construction leverages the recently studied $w_{1+\infty}$ hierarchy of soft currents and its realization from a sigma model in twistor space.</description>

      <title>Holographic observers for time-band algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Strictly speaking this algebra does not have a commutant because products of operators within the time band give rise to operators outside the time band. However, we show that in a state where the bulk contains a macroscopic observer, it is possible to define a coarse-grained version of this algebra with a non-trivial commutant, and a resolution limited by the observer's characteristics. This algebra acts on a little Hilbert space that describes excitations about the observer's state and time-translated versions of this state. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, and with a specific choice of dressing, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace. This trace can be used to define entropy differences between states in the little Hilbert space that are insensitive to the properties of the observer. We discuss some technical challenges in extending this construction to higher orders in perturbation theory. Lastly, we review the construction of interior operators in the eternal black hole and show that they can be written as elements of a crossed product algebra.</description>

      <title>Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

      <title>The 3d $A$-model and generalised symmetries, Part I: bosonic Chern-Simons theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3d $A$-model is a two-dimensional approach to the computation of supersymmetric observables of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In principle, it allows us to compute half-BPS partition functions on any compact Seifert three-manifold (as well as of expectation values of half-BPS lines thereon), but previous results focussed on the case where the gauge group $\widetilde G$ is a product of simply-connected and/or unitary gauge groups. We are interested in the more general case of a compact gauge group $G=\widetilde G/\Gamma$, which is obtained from the $\widetilde G$ theory by gauging a discrete one-form symmetry. In this paper, we discuss in detail the case of pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories (without matter) for simple groups $G$. When $G=\widetilde G$ is simply-connected, we demonstrate the exact matching between the supersymmetric approach in terms of Seifert fibering operators and the 3d TQFT approach based on topological surgery in the infrared Chern-Simons theory $\widetilde G_k$, including through the identification of subtle counterterms that relate the two approaches. We then extend this discussion to the case where the Chern-Simons theory $G_k$ can be obtained from $\widetilde G_k$ by the condensation of abelian anyons which are bosonic. Along the way, we revisit the 3d $A$-model formalism by emphasising its 2d TQFT underpinning.</description>

      <title>Two-Measure Electroweak Standard Model. Some aspects of cosmological evolution and vacuum stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the FLRW universe, the scalar field \phi(t) obtained by cosmological averaging of the local Higgs field H(x) is considered as a classical field for which the SM quantization procedure is meaningless. When applying the Two-Measure theory (TMT) to study cosmology, the ratio \zeta of the measure densities is a scalar function, which: enters into all equations of motion. Through the constraint, $\zeta$ is defined as a function of \phi(t). During cosmological evolution, \zeta(\phi) changes from \zeta\approx 0 at the inflationary stage to \zeta=1 at the approaching vacuum stage. Each stage of the classical cosmological background is determined by the set \{\phi(t), {\rm curvature}, \zeta(\phi(t))\}. The Two-Measure SM (TMSM) is realized in the context of cosmology as a set of cosmologically modified copies of the GWS model. Each of the copies exists as a local quantum field theory defined on the classical cosmological background at the appropriate stage of its evolution. This basic idea is studied in detail for the stage of slow-roll inflation and for the stage of approaching vacuum. Due to the presence of \zeta(\phi(t)) in all equations of motion, all TMSM coupling constants turn out to be running (classical) TMT-effective parameters. During cosmological evolution, changing these parameters yields new results: the classical running TMT-effective Higgs selfcoupling increases from \lambda\sim 10^{-11} (which ensures consistency with Planck's CMB data at \xi=\frac{1}{6}) to \lambda\sim 0.1 near vacuum; the mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign from positive to negative, providing standard SSB; the classical running gauge and Yukawa coupling constants change by several orders of magnitude; the GWS theory is reproduced so that the fermion mass hierarchy is obtained quite naturally. 1-loop quantum corrections preserves the slow-roll inflation and does not violate the vacuum stability.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Higgs Branch of 5d Conformal Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the elementary building blocks in the atomic classification of 5d SCFTs there are 5d bifundamental conformal matter theories of various kinds. In this work we study the Higgs branch of these models and of the corresponding molecules arising from their fusion. To this aim we use two complementary independent strategies. On the one hand for the type $A$ and $D$ conformal matter, we identify dual $(p,q)$ brane webs in IIB and exploit them to read off the corresponding magnetic quivers. On the other hand, we exploit circle reductions and study the resulting 4d $\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs, giving an alternative derivation of their Higgs branches which extend also to the $E$ types.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation -- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efolds of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is bipartite entanglement sufficient for holography? Through the analysis of the Markov gap, it is known that the answer is no. In this paper, we give a new perspective on this issue from a different angle using a multi-entropy. We define a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy from a $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy by subtracting appropriate linear combinations of $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite multi-entropies for $\mathtt{\tilde{q}} &lt; \mathtt{q}$, in such a way that the genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy vanishes for all $\mathtt{\tilde{q}}$-partite entangled states. After studying several aspects, we apply it to black holes and holography. For the application to black holes, we see that such a genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite multi-entropy is important only after the Page time. For the application to holography, we prove that non-bipartite multi-entropies are always positive and $\mathcal{O}\left({1/ G_N}\right)$, as long as boundary subregions are connected. This indicates that for holography, genuine multi-partite entanglement is not small and plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Epistemic-Pragmatist Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics: A Comparative Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate similarities and differences between the main neo-Copenhagen (or "epistemic-pragmatist") interpretations of quantum mechanics, here identified as those defined by the rejection of an ontological nature of the quantum states and the simultaneous avoidance of hidden variables, while maintaining the quantum formalism unchanged. We argue that there is a single general interpretive framework in which the core claims that the various interpretations in the class are committed to, and which they emphasize to varying degrees, can be represented. We also identify, however, remaining differences of a more substantial nature, and we offer a first analysis of them. We also argue that these remaining differences cannot be resolved within the formalism of quantum mechanics itself and identify the more general philosophical considerations that can be used in order to break this interpretation underdetermination.</description>

Abstract: A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. It naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the space-time evolution of electromagnetic fields along with the azimuthal fluctuations of these fields and their correlation with the initial matter geometry specified by the participant plane in the presence of finite electric $\left(\sigma\right)$ and chiral magnetic $\left(\sigma_{\chi}\right)$ conductivities in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We observe the partially asymmetric behavior of the spatial distributions of the electric and magnetic fields in a conducting medium when compared to the Lienard-Wiechert (L-W) solutions, and deceleration of the decay of the fields is observed in both isobar collisions. While studying the correlation between the magnetic field direction and the participant plane, we see the sizeable suppression of the correlation in the presence of finite conductivities when compared to the L-W case, reflecting the importance of taking into account the medium properties such as conductivities while calculating the magnetic field induced observable quantities.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as possible probes for quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the interplay between neutrinos and quantum gravity, illustrating some proposals about the use of these particles as probes for the supposed quantized structure of spacetime. The residual signatures of a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity can manifest themselves modifying the free particle dispersion relations and the connected velocity. In neutrino sector these supposed effects can modify the time of flight for astrophysical particles with different energies and can affect the usual neutrino oscillation pattern introducing species depending perturbations. We will highlight how perturbations caused by non-standard interactions in the solar neutrino sector can mimic the presumed quantum gravity effects. In fact, the mathematical formulation of non-standard interactions is equivalent to that of CPT-odd perturbations. We will, therefore, emphasize the need to identify the nature of different contributions in order to disentangle them in the search for quantum gravity effects. As a final point we will discuss the possibility to detect in the neutrino sector decoherence effects caused by the quantum gravity supposed perturbations. By reviewing current experimental constraints and observations, we seek to shed light on the intricate relationship between neutrinos and quantum gravity, and discuss the challenges and future directions in this fascinating field of research.</description>

      <title>The impact of an antisymmetric tensor on charged black holes: evaporation process, geodesics, deflection angle, scattering effects and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of anti-symmetric tensor effects, which trigger the Lorentz symmetry breaking, on charged spherically symmetric black holes. Initially, we address an overview of the model, laying the groundwork for deriving solutions to black holes. With this, we analyze the horizons, critical orbits, and geodesics. We compute quasinormal modes and the time-domain solution with a particular emphasis on vectorial perturbations. In addition, we derive the Hawking temperature to perform the calculation of the remnant mass. Additionally, we estimate the lifetime of the black holes until they reach their final stage after the evaporation process. Finally, we explore the emission rate, the deflection angle and, we investigate the correlation between quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this comment, we point out a series of errors made by Senjaya in your paper (2024) \cite{Senjaya}. In particular, these errors involved the Dirac equation in the 3+1 dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, tetrad field, curved gamma matrices, and the time-independent Dirac equation written in terms of the inner/scalar product between the gamma matrices and the orbital angular momentum (i.e., $\vec{\gamma}\cdot\vec{L}$). Besides, the strange/peculiar thing about all this is that even Senjaya \cite{Senjaya} citing Collas and Klein \cite{Collas}, where the (mathematical) formalism is correct, everything indicates that he ``ignored'' or ``forgot'' to use such formalism in your paper. Therefore, using Ref. \cite{Collas}, we show here the correct form of the errors made by Senjaya \cite{Senjaya}.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Black Holes in $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of black hole thermodynamics is a fascinating area of study that explores the connections between thermodynamic properties and topological features of black holes. We successfully derive the field equations for $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg theory, providing a framework for studying the interplay between modified gravity and non-linear electromagnetic effects. We obtain an analytical solution for a static, spherically symmetric, energy-dependent black hole with constant scalar curvature. Also, our analysis of black holes in F(R)-Euler-Heisenberg gravity's Rainbow reveals significant insights into their topological properties. We identified the total topological charges by examining the normalized field lines along various free parameters. Our findings indicate that the parameters $( R_0 )$ and $( f_{\epsilon} = g_{\epsilon} )$ influence the topological charges. These results are comprehensively summarized in Table I. In examining the photon sphere within this model, the sign of the parameter \( R_0 \) plays a crucial role in determining whether the model adopts a dS or AdS configuration. An interesting characteristic of this model is that, in its AdS form, it avoids the formation of naked singularity regions, which sets it apart from many other models. Typically, varying parameter values in other models can result in the division of space into regions of black holes and naked singularities. However, this model consistently retains its black hole behavior by featuring an unstable photon sphere, regardless of parameter values within the acceptable range. In its dS form, the behavior of the model's photon sphere remains consistent with other dS models and does not exhibit unique differences.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time, although primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$ should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider hard-wall AdS/QCD models extended by a string-theory inspired Chern-Simons action in terms of a superconnection involving a bi-fundamental scalar field which corresponds to the open-string tachyon of brane-antibrane configurations and which is naturally identified with the holographic dual of the quark condensate in chiral symmetry breaking. This realizes both the axial and chiral anomalies of QCD with a Witten-Veneziano mechanism for the $\eta'$ mass in addition to current quark masses, but somewhat differently than in the Katz-Schwartz AdS/QCD model used previously by us to evaluate pseudoscalar and axial vector transition form factors and their contribution to the HLBL piece of the muon $g-2$. Compared to the Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description of axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon rates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found to be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar transition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the $\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate non-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however, a result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM Collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing toward a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal~\cite{ran2024hidden} experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Field-theory approach to flat polymerized membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the field-theoretic renormalization-group approach to critical properties of flat polymerized membranes. We start with a presentation of the flexural effective model that is entirely expressed in terms of a transverse (flexural) field with non-local interactions. We then provide a detailed account of the full three-loop computations of the renormalization-group functions of the model within the dimensional regularization scheme. The latter allows us to consider the general case of a $d$-dimensional membrane embedded in $D$-dimensional space. Focusing on the critical flat phase of two-dimensional membranes $(d = 2)$ in three-dimensional space $(D = 3)$, we analyse the corresponding flow diagram and present the derivation of the anomalous stiffness. The latter controls all the other critical exponents of the theory such as the roughness exponent and the scaling of the elastic constants. State-of-the-art four-loop results as well as discussions on the structure of the perturbative series and comparison with other approaches are also provided.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys.Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum Kerr and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the deformed Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*. The plasma reduces the size of black hole shadow and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of principal chiral model from solutions of associative Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <title>Qubit Regularization of Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Into the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- An Abelian mechanism without instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Recently VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG) and the Maximal Abelian +U(1) gauge (MAU1) in addition to the gradient flow. The additional term tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ({\tau}) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also suppressed. The topological charge Qt and its Abelian counterpart Qa are discussed also on lattice. Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition of Qa(A) is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG and around -2 in MAU1 in a typical configuration where Qt(A) is stabilized around -1 after the flow time {\tau} is larger than 2.</description>

      <title>Non-Topological Soliton Bardeen Boson Stars and Their Frozen States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>
