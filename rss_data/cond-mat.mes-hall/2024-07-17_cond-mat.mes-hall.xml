      <title>Strain induced tunable band gap and optical properties of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we highlight the potential of strain engineering in graphene/hBN (hexagonal Boron nitride) 2D heterostructures, enabling their use as wide-range light absorbers with significant implications for optoelectronic applications. We systematically investigate the electronic and optical properties of graphene/hBN under the application of strain, considering various stacking geometries within the framework of density-functional theory. The semimetallic graphene layer upon aligning on the insulating hexagonal boron nitride sheet opens a few tens of meV band gap at the Dirac point due to the induced on-site energy differences on the two sublattices of graphene. Here, we demonstrate that by simultaneously tuning the interlayer distance and lattice constant, this band gap can be significantly increased to 1 eV. Interestingly, in both scenarios (small and large band gaps), the material undergoes a transition from a semiconductor to a semimetallic state. Importantly, the tunability of this band gap is strongly influenced by the specific stacking configuration. We further explored the optical properties across a broad spectrum, revealing that the presence of a strain-induced band gap fundamentally alters how light interacts with the system.</description>

      <title>Restricted Boltzmann Machine for Modeling Complex Physical Systems: A Case Study in Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines are powerful tools in the field of generative, probabilistic learning, capable of capturing complex dependencies in data. By understanding their architecture and operational principles, one can employ them for diverse purposes such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning and even representing and analyzing various physical systems. This work aims to provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of restricted Boltzmann machines in modelling complex physical systems in the context of artificial spin ice. Geometrical frustration in artificial spin ice systems creates degeneracies leading to complex states and collective dynamics. From reconfigurable magnonics to neuromorphic computing, artificial spin systems are emerging as versatile functional platforms that go beyond simply imitating naturally occurring materials. Using out of equilibrium data from Monte Carlo simulations of artificial spin ice geometries, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of learning artificial spin ice state distributions with restricted Boltzmann machines. Results indicate that careful application of the restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm can reduce the training data required for feature extraction, which can be used for faster sample generation. Additionally, we demonstrate how the restricted Boltzmann machine can distinguish different artificial spin ice geometries by identifying their respective state distribution features.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Control of Excitons in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11252v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Mach-Zehnder interference of fractionalized electron-spin excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-channel Coulomb interaction mixes charge excitations in copropagating quantum Hall edge channels, generating coupled excitation eigenmodes propagating at different speeds. This mode transformation causes an electron state to split into fragments, corresponding to the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid model of a chiral one-dimensional electronic system. This paper reports the coherent evolution of an electron state under the fractionalization process in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer employing copropagating spin-up and spin-down channels as the interference paths. We observe the interference visibility oscillations as a function of the voltage bias applied between the interference paths, which are attributed to the second-order interference between the fractionalized spin excitations with different phase evolutions. This observation contrasts with the single-particle picture that predicts only the first-order interference, reflecting the phase evolution of a spin-up and spin-down superposition state during the one-way transport. The second-order interference manifests the coherent splitting of the superposition state to the mutually independent fast and slow excitations. Our observation offers the fractionalization process as a novel way to encode an electron spin state to spatially separated fragments.</description>

      <title>Coherent electron splitting in interacting chiral edge channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper theoretically studies the quantum coherence of an electronic state on an artificial chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid. Coulomb interaction between copropagating integer quantum Hall edge channels causes the TL liquid nature of charge excitations, resulting in the splitting of an electronic state into bosonic eigenmodes. We investigate the single-electron coherence under the splitting process by calculating the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer employing copropagating spin-up and spin-down edge channels as the interference paths. We investigate the voltage bias dependence of the AB oscillations at zero temperature, taking the inter-channel interaction into account using the bosonization technique. The calculation results of the visibility and the phase of the AB oscillations show non-monotonical bias dependence when the copropagating channels are electrostatically asymmetric. These observations are interpreted as the signatures of the second-order interference between the fractionalized spin excitations with different phase evolutions. We also report finite entanglement entropy between the bosonic eigenmodes split from an electron, which presents an analogy between the `electron splitting' in a TL liquid and the Cooper-pair splitting at a superconducting junction.</description>

      <title>Conformational tuning of magnetic interactions in coupled nanographenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenalenyl (C$_{13}$H$_9$) is an open-shell spin-$1/2$ nanographene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS), covalently-bonded phenalenyl dimers have been shown to feature conductance steps associated with singlet-triplet excitations of a spin-$1/2$ dimer with antiferromagnetic exchange. Here, we address the possibility of tuning the magnitude of the exchange interactions by varying the dihedral angle between the two molecules within a dimer. Theoretical methods, ranging from density functional theory calculations to many-body model Hamiltonians solved within different levels of approximation, are used to explain STM-IETS measurements of twisted phenalenyl dimers on a h-BN/Rh(111) surface. By means of first-principles calculations, we also propose strategies to induce sizable twist angles in surface-adsorbed phenalenyl dimers via functional groups, including a photoswitchable scheme. This work paves the way toward tuning magnetic couplings in carbon-based spin chains and two-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Interlayer charge transfer in graphene 2D polyimide heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical integration of multiple two-dimensional (2D) materials in heterostructures, held together by van der Waals forces, has opened unprecedented possibilities for modifying the (opto-)electronic properties of nanodevices. Graphene, with its remarkable opto-electronic properties, is an ideal candidate for such applications. Further candidates are 2D polymers, crystalline polymeric materials with customizable structure and electronic properties that can be synthesized in all mathematically possible Bravais lattices. In this study, we investigated the optoelectronic properties of a heterostructure created by pristine graphene and a rectangular 2D polyimide (2DPI) film. This imprints a new superlattice on graphene in conjunction with a direct influence on its electronic properties. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that interlayer charge exchange between the 2D polymer and graphene induces hole doping in the graphene layer. We have also observed that the properties of the heterostructure are dependent on the substrate used in experiments, likely due to the porous character of the 2DPI allowing direct interaction of graphene with the support. These findings highlight the unique ability to tailor functionalities in 2D polymers-based heterostructures, allowing the development of optoelectronic devices with precisely engineered properties and stimulating further exploration of the diverse phenomena accessible through tailored designs of the 2D polymers.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin-dependent tunneling in a MoSe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ van der Waals heterostructure on exciton and trion emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ fully encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride using low-temperature photoluminescence and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</description>

      <title>Dephasing and error dynamics affecting a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information transport over micron to millimeter scale distances is critical for the operation of practical quantum processors based on spin qubits. One method of achieving a long-range interaction is by coherent electron spin shuttling through an array of silicon quantum dots. In order to execute many shuttling operations with high fidelity, it is essential to understand the dynamics of qubit dephasing and relaxation during the shuttling process in order to mitigate them. However, errors arising after many repeated shuttles are not yet well documented. Here, we probe decay dynamics contributing to dephasing and relaxation of a singlet-triplet qubit during coherent spin shuttling over many $N$ repeated shuttle operations. We find that losses are dominated by magnetic dephasing for small $N&lt;10^3$ and by incoherent shuttle errors for large $N&gt;10^3$. Additionally, we estimate shuttle error rates below $1\times10^{-4}$ out to at least $N=10^3$, representing an encouraging figure for future implementations of spin shuttling to entangle distant qubits.</description>

Abstract: Electron and lattice heat transport have been investigated in bilayer thin films of gold and CoSb$_3$ after photo-excitation of the nanometric top gold layer through picosecond x-ray scattering in a pump-probe setup. The unconventional observation of a larger portion of the deposited heat being detected first in the underlying CoSb$_3$ layer supports the picture of ballistic transport of the photo-excited electrons from gold to the underlying layer. The lattice expansion recorded by x-ray scattering allows accounting for the energy deposition and heat transport.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement scaling and area-law charge fluctuations in a non-Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu{=}1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic example of a non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter precisely different from a Fermi liquid? The entanglement entropy of the CFL state was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analogue [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu{=}1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional continuum system. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu{=}1/2$ but also at $\nu{=}1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu{=}1$ and $\nu{=}1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in the CFL state.</description>

      <title>In-situ local imaging of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is an intrinsically interesting research focus in condensed matter physics but the study is limited by low superconducting ($T_c$) and magnetic ($T_m$) transition temperatures in related materials. Here, we used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device to image the in-situ diamagnetic and ferromagnetic responses of RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ with high $T_c$ and $T_m$. We observed significant suppression of superfluid density in vicinity of the magnetic phase transition, signifying fluctuation-enhanced magnetic scatterings between Eu spins and Fe 3$d$ conduction electrons. Intriguingly, we observed multiple ferromagnetic domains which should be absent in an ideal magnetic helical phase. The formation of these domains demonstrates a weak $c$-axis ferromagnetic component probably arising from Eu spin-canting effect, indicative of possible superconductivity-driven domain Meissner and domain vortex-antivortex phases as revealed in EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$. Our observations highlight RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ is a unique system which includes multiple interplay channels between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of single and entangled photons is crucial for photonic quantum information processing. Quantum dots (QDs) are promising sources capable of producing high-quality quantum light states on demand, although at a rate typically limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs. We achieve this by coupling individual QDs to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars characterized with mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, consequently enabling high Purcell enhancement across a bandwidth of 15 nm. We measure a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 % from QDs within these cavities. In addition to providing a valuable platform for exploring light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, this work represents a significant stride towards developing QD-sources emitting at high repetition rates, underpinning their role in the future of quantum communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and operator correlation signatures of many-body quantum Zeno phases in inefficiently monitored noisy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between information-scrambling Hamiltonians and local continuous measurements hosts platforms for exotic measurement-induced phase transition in out-of-equilibrium steady states. Here, we consider such transitions under the addition of local random white noise and measurement inefficiency in a XX spin chain. We identify a non-monotonic dependence on the local noise strength in both the averaged entanglement and operator correlations, specifically the subsystem parity variance. While the non-monotonicity persists at any finite efficiency for the operator correlations, it disappears at finite inefficiency for the entanglement. The analysis of scaling with the system size in a finite length chain indicates that, at finite efficiency, this effect leads to distinct MiPTs for operator correlations and entanglement. Our result hints at a difference between area-law entanglement scaling and Zeno-localized phases for inefficient monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT), we calculate the magnetic short-ranged exchange forces between a magnetic tip and an adatom adsorbed on the antiferromagnetic Mn monolayer on the W(110) surface [Mn/W(110)]. These exchange forces can be measured in magnetic exchange force microscopy allowing atomic-scale imaging of spin structures on insulating and conducting surfaces. We consider two types of $3d$ transition-metal atoms with intrinsic magnetic moments: Co and Mn and Ir as an example of a $5d$ transition-metal atom exhibiting an induced magnetic moment on Mn/W(110). The tips are modeled by Fe pyramids and terminated either with an Fe or a Mn apex atom. From our total energy DFT calculations for a parallel and antiparallel alignment between tip and adatom magnetic moments we obtain the exchange energy $E_{\rm ex}(d)$ as a function of tip-adatom distance $d$. The exchange forces, $F_{\rm ex}(d)$, are calculated based on the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. We show that structural relaxations of tip and sample due to their interaction need to be taken into account. Due to the exchange interaction the relaxations depend on the alignment between tip and adatom magnetization -- an effect which will affect the tunneling magnetoresistance that can be measured by a scanning tunneling microscope. A maximum in the exchange energy and force curves is obtained for magnetic adatoms at tip-adatom separations of about 3 to 4~{\AA}. The exchange forces with an Fe terminated tip reach a maximum value of up to 0.2~nN and 0.6~nN for Co and Mn adatoms, respectively, and prefer an antiferromagnetic coupling. Surprisingly, we also find an exchange force of up to 0.2~nN for Ir adatoms. We analyze the exchange interaction between tip and adatom based on the spin-polarized electronic structure of the coupled system......</description>

      <title>Uhlmann-quench, A Protocol to Measure the Uhlmann Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPT) following quantum quenches exhibit singular behavior of the overlap of the initial and evolved states. Here we present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of mixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on a mixed-state generalization of the Berry phase known as the Uhlmann phase. It has been shown that the geometric condition of the Uhlmann phase is incompatible with Hamiltonian dynamics, making its realization and measurement a challenging task. Nevertheless, we formulate the evolution of purification of the density matrix which not only respects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also incorporate the Uhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase following a quantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system, geometric DQPTs can emerge with both singular behavior in the overlap and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the Uhlmann phase is generated at the end of each cycle. The Uhlmann quench thus offers a route for investigating the interplay between quantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.</description>

      <title>Segregation to grain boundaries in disordered systems: an application to a Ni-based superalloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in realistic engineering alloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a $\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven anisotropic coupling effect in antiferromagnetic topological insulator: Mechanism for high-Chern-number quantum anomalous Hall state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) topological insulators (TIs), which host magnetically gapped Dirac-cone surface states and exhibit many exotic physical phenomena, have attracted great attention. Here, we find that the coupled surface states can be intertwined to give birth to a set of $2n$ unique new Dirac cones, dubbed intertwined Dirac cones, through the anisotropic coupling enforced by crystalline $n$-fold ($n=2, 3, 4, 6$) rotation symmetry $C_{nz}$ in the presence of a $PT$-symmetry breaking potential, for example, an electric field. Interestingly, we also find that the warping effect further drives the intertwined Dirac-cone state into a quantum anomalous Hall phase with a high Chern number ($C=n$). Then, based on first-principles calculations, we have explicitly demonstrated six intertwined Dirac cones and a Chern insulating phase with a high Chern number ($C=3$) in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$$/$(Bi$_2$Te$_3$)$_{\mathrm{m}}/$MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures, as well as the $C=2$ and $C=4$ phases in HgS and $\alpha$-Ag$_2$Te films, respectively. This work discovers the intertwined Dirac-cone state in AFM TI thin films, which reveals a mechanism for designing the quantum anomalous Hall state with a high Chern number and also paves a way for studying highly tunable high-Chen-number flat bands of twistronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study direct current (DC) generation induced by microwave irradiation to ferroelectric materials. The DC generation originates from microwave absorption called dielectric loss due to the delay of dielectric response. Such current generation can be formulated as the low-frequency limit of the phonon shift current which arises from an increase of electric polarization accompanying photoexcitation of phonons due to the electron-phonon coupling. To study the DC generation by the dielectric loss, we apply the diagrammatic treatment of nonlinear optical responses to photoexcitations of phonons and derive the general formula for phonon shift current. We then study the DC generation in the low-frequency region and find that the current scales as $\propto \omega^2$ for the linearly polarized light and time reversal symmetric systems. We estimate the order of magnitude of the DC generation by dielectric loss, indicating its feasibility for experimental detection in the GHz region.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for Reproducible Analysis of Semiconducting 2D Nanomaterials Based on UV/VIS Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable analysis of liquid dispersions of 2D materials is essential for fully harnessing their potential, allowing size and quality validation before subsequent processing or device fabrication. Existing UV-VIS extinction spectroscopy-based metrics, particularly those related to thickness, have shown promise but rely on manual data processing, which can introduce irreproducibility and user errors. To address this challenge and enable uniform analysis across laboratories, a freely available program is developed for the reproducible analysis of nanosheet dispersions. Specifically, a smoothing routine is applied to the spectral data, takes the second derivative, and use integral areas to find the wavelength of exciton transitions. This program enables rapid measurement of nanosheet concentration, length, and thickness by UV-VIS spectroscopy and thickness metrics are refined for eight common 2D nanomaterials. The program and methodology are freely available for use and allow metrics for new materials to be implemented easily in the future.</description>

      <title>Giant resonant skew scattering of plasma waves in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron skew scattering by impurities is one of the major mechanisms behind the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic nanostructures. It is particularly strong at the surface of topological insulators where electron dynamics is governed by the spin-1/2 Dirac equation. Motivated by recently discovered mappings between hydrodynamics and the spin-1 Dirac equation, we consider the scattering of plasma waves -- propagating charge density oscillations -- excited in graphene off a non-uniform magnetic field created by an adjacent circular micromagnet. The calculated scattering amplitude not only exhibits a giant asymmetry, or skewness, but is resonantly enhanced if the frequency of the incoming wave matches the frequency of the chiral trapped mode circulating the micromagnet in only one direction. Furthermore, if the frequency of the incoming plasma wave is a few times larger than the Larmor frequency, the angular distribution of its forward scattering is almost indistinguishable from that of a Dirac electron at the surface of a topological insulator scattering off a magnetic impurity. The micrometer scale of the proposed setup enables direct investigations of individual skew scattering events previously inaccessible in electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of non-Hermitian skin effect and extended states in one-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with staggered onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping up to the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) sites. Due to the NNN nonreciprocity, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in the system under open boundary conditions (OBC) can be energy dependent, and there will be NHSE edges in the eigenenergy spectrum, which separates the eigenstates localized at the opposite ends of the lattice. We find that the interplay between the nonreciprocal hopping and onsite modulations can reverse the direction of the skin effect and modify the position of the NHSE edge. Moreover, by tuning the system parameters, some of the eigenstates under OBC will become fully extended with the corresponding eigenenergies being imaginary under both open and periodic boundary conditions. Thus, the extended states can coexist with the NHSH in the same system. The NHSE can even be completely dissolved with all the eigenstates being extended when the modulation is imaginary. Our work unveils the intricate interplay between onsite modulations and nonreciprocal hopping in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Environmental fluctuations degrade the performance of solid-state qubits but can in principle be mitigated by real-time Hamiltonian estimation down to time scales set by the estimation efficiency. We implement a physics-informed and an adaptive Bayesian estimation strategy and apply them in real time to a semiconductor spin qubit. The physics-informed strategy propagates a probability distribution inside the quantum controller according to the Fokker-Planck equation, appropriate for describing the effects of nuclear spin diffusion in gallium-arsenide. Evaluating and narrowing the anticipated distribution by a predetermined qubit probe sequence enables improved dynamical tracking of the uncontrolled magnetic field gradient within the singlet-triplet qubit. The adaptive strategy replaces the probe sequence by a small number of qubit probe cycles, with each probe time conditioned on the previous measurement outcomes, thereby further increasing the estimation efficiency. The combined real-time estimation strategy efficiently tracks low-frequency nuclear spin fluctuations in solid-state qubits, and can be applied to other qubit platforms by tailoring the appropriate update equation to capture their distinct noise sources.</description>

      <title>Features and Peculiarities of Gate-Voltage Modulation of Spin-Orbit Interaction in FeCoB Nanomagnets: Insights into the Physical Origins of the VCMA Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates the systematic dependencies of the anisotropy field and the strength of spin-orbit (SO) interaction on gate voltage in Ta/FeB/MgO nanomagnets. Our findings reveal an intriguing opposite polarity in the gate-voltage dependencies of the anisotropy field and the coefficient of SO interaction across all studied nanomagnets. This opposite polarity indicates that the gate-voltage modulation of spin-orbit interaction is not the primary contributor to the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect. Instead, the gate-voltage modulation of magnetization emerges as the most probable candidate, given its polarity aligns with the observed modulation of anisotropy. The modulation of magnetic anisotropy is influenced by two major contributions of opposite polarities, which effectively counterbalance each other and reduce the overall VCMA effect. Optimizing the balance between these contributions could potentially lead to a substantial enhancement of the VCMA effect. Our measurements did not detect any modulation of the in-plane component of spin accumulation by the gate voltage.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the effective Hamiltonian arising from the tight binding model, we study the behaviour of low-lying excitations for bilayer graphene placed in periodic external magnetic fields by using irreducible second order supersymmetry transformations. The coupled system of equations describing these excitations is reduced to a pair of periodic Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians intertwined by a second order differential operator. The direct implementation of more general second-order supersymmetry transformations allows to create nonsingular Schr\"odinger potentials with periodicity defects and bound states embedded in the forbidden bands, which turn out to be associated to quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices. Applications in quantum metamaterials stem from the ability to engineer and control such bound states which could lead to a fast development of the subject in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Edge magnetoplasmon is an emergent chiral bosonic mode promising for studying electronic quantum optics. While the plasmon transport has been investigated with various techniques for decades,its coupling to a mesoscopic device remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the coupling between a single plasmon mode in a quantum Hall plasmon resonator and a double quantum dot (DQD). Resonant plasmon-assisted tunneling is observed in the DQD through absorbing or emitting plasmons stored in the resonator. By using the DQD as a spectrometer, the plasmon energy and the coupling strength are evaluated, which can be controlled by changing the electrostatic environment of the quantum Hall edge. The observed plasmon-electron coupling encourages us for studying strong coupling regimes of plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Structural superlubricity is a special frictionless contact in which two crystals are in incommensurate arrangement such that relative in-plane translation is associated with vanishing energy barrier crossing. So far, it has been realized in multilayer graphene and other van der Waals two-dimensional crystals with hexagonal or triangular crystalline symmetries, leading to isotropic frictionless contacts. Directional structural superlubricity, to date unrealized in two-dimensional systems, is possible when the reciprocal lattices of the two crystals coincide in one direction only. Here, we evidence directional structural superlubricity a $\alpha$-bismuthene/graphite van der Waals system, manifested by spontaneous hopping of the islands over hundreds of nanometres at room temperature, resolved by low-energy electron microscopy and supported by registry simulations. Statistical analysis of individual and collective $\alpha$-bismuthene islands populations reveal a heavy-tailed distribution of the hopping lengths and sticking times indicative of L{\'e}vy flight dynamics, largely unobserved in condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior around the fixed points driven by fermion-fermion interactions and disorders in the nodal-line superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the intricate interplay between short-range fermion-fermion interactions and disorder scatterings beneath the superconducting dome of noncentrosymmetric nodal-line superconductors. Employing the renormalization group that unbiasedly treats all kinds of potential degrees of freedom, we establish energy-dependent coupled flows for all associated interaction parameters. Decoding the low-energy information from these coupled evolutions leads to the emergence of several intriguing behavior in the low-energy regime. At first, we identify eight distinct types of fixed points, which are determined by the competition of all interaction parameters and dictate the low-energy properties. Next, we carefully examine and unveil distinct fates of physical implications as approaching such fixed points. The density of states of quasiparticles displays a linear dependence on frequency around the first fixed point, while other fixed points present diverse frequency-dependent behavior. Compressibility and specific heat exhibit unique trends around different fixed points, with the emergence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior nearby the fifth fixed point. Furthermore, after evaluating the susceptibilities of the potential states, we find that a certain phase transition below the critical temperature can be induced when the system approaches the fifth fixed point, transitioning from the nodal-line superconducting state to another superconducting state. This research would enhance our understanding of the unique behavior in the low-energy regime of nodal-line superconductors.</description>

      <title>On the geometric phase and its role in the design of elastic topological materials</title>

Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the fundamental nature and evolution of the dynamic response in a wide spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the concept of geometric phase. This review revisits the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its critical role in the design and dynamic behavior of elastic waveguides. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on the geometric features of the waveguide.</description>

Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of bosonic Bogoliubov quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12981</link>

Abstract: Topological and geometrical features arising in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems have mainly been studied by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. We propose how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>
