      <title>Electron-mirror duality and thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical electromagnetic radiation from moving point charges is foundational, but the thermal dynamics responsible for classical acceleration temperature are poorly understood. We investigate the thermal properties of classical electromagnetic radiation in the context of the correspondence between accelerated electrons and moving mirrors, focusing on three trajectories with asymptotically infinite (Davies-Fulling), asymptotically zero (Walker-Davies), and eternally uniform acceleration. The latter two are argued not to be thermal, while the former is found to emit thermal photons with a temperature that depends on the electron's speed. Thermal radiation from the mirror reveals a zero-jerk condition.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Neptune Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the differences detected between the observed and the predicted positions of Uranus taking only the ancient planets into account led to the discovery of planet Neptune in 1846. This event remains one of the best accomplishments ever achieved in the history of Astronomy and Classical Mechanics. In this paper, we study the perturbations in the orbit of Uranus due to Neptune and its effects from a modern numerical point of view of the $N$-body problem. The effects induced by Pluto in the orbit of Neptune, as the historical search for a ninth planet in the Solar System (recently boostered again with the hypothesis of the so-called Planet Nine) back in the days was propelled by some supposed small inconsistencies in the orbit of the ice giants, are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Perfect nonradiating electromagnetic source and its self-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonradiating sources and anapoles are curious objects from the physics of invisibility that illuminate subtle concepts of fundamental electrodynamics and have promising applications in nanophotonics. The present work shows that a perfectly conducting sphere with a hidden magnetic field is a simple nonradiating electromagnetic source with mechanical excitation and complete internal confinement of electromagnetic energy. It does not require external electromagnetic excitation and is excited by rotation, which induces internal charges and currents with a self-compensating external radiation. The constructed source acts on itself through Lorentz forces emerging from the interaction of charges and currents with electromagnetic fields inside the sphere and, when having a freedom of rotation about the fixed center, exhibits regular precession like a gyroscope. This self-action reveals an internal electromagnetic activity of the perfect nonradiating source, externally inactive and invisible. Neutron stars, these nanospheres of space, can be such natural nonradiating sources when their magnetic fields are buried.</description>
