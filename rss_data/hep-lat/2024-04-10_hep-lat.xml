      <title>Lattice determination of the Batalin-Vilkovisky function and the strong running interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky function is a central component in the modern formulation of the background field method and the physical applications derived from it. In the present work we report on novel lattice results for this particular quantity, obtained by capitalizing on its equality with the Kugo-Ojima function in the Landau gauge. The results of the lattice simulation are in very good agreement with the predictions derived from a continuum analysis based on the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations. In addition, we show that an important relation connecting this function with the ghost propagator is fulfilled rather accurately. With the aid of these results, we carry out the first completely lattice-based determination of the process-independent strong running interaction, employed in a variety of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in lattices with non-abelian gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy, taken here to be geometric, requires a geometrically separable Hilbert space. In lattice gauge theories, it is not immediately clear if the physical Hilbert space is geometrically separable. In a previous paper we have shown that the physical Hilbert space in pure gauge abelian lattice theories exhibits some form of geometric scaling with the lattice volume, which suggest that the space is locally factorizable and, therefore, geometrically separable. In this paper, we provide strong evidence that indicates that this scaling is not present when the group is non-abelian. We do so by looking at the scaling of the dimension of the physical Hilbert space of theories with certain discrete groups. The lack of an appropriate scaling implies that the physical Hilbert space of such a theory does not admit a local factorization. We then extend the reasoning, as sensibly possible, to SU(2) and SU(N) to reach the same conclusion. Lastly, we show that the addition of matter fields to non-abelian lattice gauge theories makes the resulting physical Hilbert space locally factorizable.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>Un-screened forces in Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the correlator of temporal Wilson lines at non-zero temperature in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with the aim to define the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature. For temperatures $153~{\rm MeV} \leq T \leq 352~{\rm MeV}$ the spectral representation of this correlator is consistent with a broadened peak in the spectral function, position or width of which then defines the real or imaginary parts of the heavy quark-antiquark potential at non-zero temperature, respectively. We find that the potential's real part is not screened contrary to the widely-held expectations. We comment on how this fact may modify the picture of quarkonium melting in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Shallow Bound States and Hints for Broad Resonances with Quark Content $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ in $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ Scattering from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the energy dependence of the $B$-$\bar{D}$ and $B^*$-$\bar{D}$ isospin-0, $S$-wave scattering amplitudes both below and above the thresholds using lattice QCD, which allows us to investigate rigorously whether mixed bottom-charm $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ tetraquarks exist as bound states or resonances. The scattering phase shifts are obtained using L\"uscher's method from the energy spectra in two different volumes. To ensure that no relevant energy level is missed, we use large, symmetric $7 \times 7$ and $8 \times 8$ correlation matrices that include, at both source and sink, $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering operators with the lowest three or four possible back-to-back momenta in addition to local $\bar{b}\bar{c}ud$ operators. We fit the energy dependence of the extracted scattering phase shifts using effective-range expansions. We observe sharp peaks in the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ scattering rates close to the thresholds, which are associated with shallow bound states, either genuine or virtual, a few MeV or less below the $B^{(*)}$-$\bar{D}$ thresholds. In addition, we find hints for resonances with masses of order $100$ MeV above the thresholds and decay widths of order $200$ MeV.</description>

      <title>P-wave fully charm and fully bottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the mass spectra of the P-wave fully charm and fully bottom tetraquark states in the framework of QCD sum rules. We construct the interpolating currents by inserting the covariant derivative operator $\overset{ \leftrightarrow } { \mathcal D }_{ \mu }$ between the S-wave diquark and antidiquark fields. The excitation structures show that the pure $\lambda$-mode excited P-wave fully heavy tetraquarks exist for the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}, 1^{-+}, 2^{--}, 2^{-+}$ and $3^{--}$, while it is difficult to separate the $\lambda$-mode and $\rho$-mode excitations in the $0^{-+}$ channel. Within three Lorentz indices, there is no pure $\lambda$-mode excited P-wave fully charm/bottom tetraquark operators with $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $3^{-+}$. Our results support that the recent observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ resonances could be interpreted as the P-wave fully charm $cc \bar c \bar c$ tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$, respectively. Some P-wave fully bottom $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquark states are predicted to be lower than the di-$\eta_b(1S)$ and di-$\Upsilon(1S)$ mass thresholds. Hopefully our calculations will be useful for identifying the nature of new exotic tetraquark states.</description>
