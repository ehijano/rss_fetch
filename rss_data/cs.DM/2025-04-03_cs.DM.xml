      <title>Interval Graphs are Reconstructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is reconstructible if it is determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its proper induced subgraphs. The reconstruction conjecture postulates that every graph of order at least 3 is reconstructible. We show that interval graphs with at least three vertices are reconstructible. For this purpose we develop a technique to handle separations in the context of reconstruction. This resolves a major roadblock to using graph structure theory in the context of reconstruction. To apply our novel technique, we also develop a resilient combinatorial structure theory for interval graphs. A consequence of our result is that interval graphs can be reconstructed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Edge-weighted balanced connected partitions: Hardness and formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balanced connected $k$-partition problem (BCP) is a classic problem which consists in partitioning the set of vertices of a vertex-weighted connected graph into a collection of $k$ sets such that each of them induces a connected subgraph of roughly the same weight. There exists a vast literature on BCP that includes hardness results, approximation algorithms, integer programming formulations, and a polyhedral study. We investigate edge-weighted variants of BCP where we are given a connected graph $G$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}_\ge$, and an edge-weight function $w \colon E(G)\to\mathbb{Q}_\ge$, and the goal is to compute a spanning $k$-forest $\mathcal{T}$ of $G$ (i.e., a forest with exactly $k$ trees) that minimizes the weight of the heaviest tree in $\mathcal{T}$ in the min-max version, or maximizes the weight of the lightest tree in $\mathcal{T}$ in the max-min version. We show that both versions of this problem are $\mathsf{NP}$-hard on complete graphs with $k=2$, unweighted split graphs, and unweighted bipartite graphs with $k\geq 2$ fixed. Moreover, we prove that these problems do not admit subexponential-time algorithms, unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis fails. Finally, we devise compact and non-compact integer linear programming formulations, valid inequalities, and separation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bounds for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Graph Minor Structure Theorem, originally proven by Robertson and Seymour [JCTB, 2003], asserts that there exist functions $f_1, f_2 \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that for every non-planar graph $H$ with $t := |V(H)|$, every $H$-minor-free graph can be obtained via the clique-sum operation from graphs which embed into surfaces where $H$ does not embed after deleting at most $f_1(t)$ many vertices with up to at most $t^2-1$ many ``vortices'' which are of ``depth'' at most $f_2(t)$. In the proof presented by Robertson and Seymour the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ are non-constructive. Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan [arXiv, 2020] found a new proof showing that $f_1(t), f_2(t) \in 2^{\mathbf{poly}(t)}$. While believing that this bound was the best their methods could achieve, Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan conjectured that $f_1$ and $f_2$ can be improved to be polynomials.
  In this paper we confirm their conjecture and prove that $f_1(t), f_2(t) \in \mathbf{O}(t^{2300})$. Our proofs are fully constructive and yield a polynomial-time algorithm that either finds $H$ as a minor in a graph $G$ or produces a clique-sum decomposition for $G$ as above.</description>

      <title>On Average Distance, Level-1 Fourier Weight, and Chang's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the well-known level-1 weight bound, also known as Chang's lemma, by using an induction method. Our bounds are close to optimal no matter when the set is large or small. Our bounds can be seen as bounds on the minimum average distance problem, since maximizing the level-1 weight is equivalent to minimizing the average distance. We apply our new bounds to improve the Friedgut--Kalai--Naor theorem. We also derive the sharp version for Chang's original lemma for $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. That is, we show that in $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$, Hamming balls maximize the dimension of the space spanned by large Fourier coefficients.</description>

      <title>Investigating Simple Drawings of $K_n$ using SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a SAT framework which allows to investigate properties of simple drawings of the complete graph $K_n$ using the power of AI. In contrast to classic imperative programming, where a program is operated step by step, our framework models mathematical questions as Boolean formulas which are then solved using modern SAT solvers. Our framework for simple drawings is based on a characterization via rotation systems and finite forbidden substructures. We showcase its universality by addressing various open problems, reproving previous computational results and deriving several new computational results. In particular, we test and progress on several unavoidable configurations such as variants of Rafla's conjecture on plane Hamiltonian cycles, Harborth's conjecture on empty triangles, and crossing families for general simple drawings as well as for various subclasses. Moreover, based our computational results we propose some new challenging conjectures.</description>

      <title>Faster Mixing of the Jerrum-Sinclair Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Jerrum-Sinclair Markov chain on matchings mixes in time $\widetilde{O}(\Delta^2 m)$ on any graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and maximum degree $\Delta$, for any constant edge weight $\lambda&gt;0$. For general graphs with arbitrary, potentially unbounded $\Delta$, this provides the first improvement over the classic $\widetilde{O}(n^2 m)$ mixing time bound of Jerrum and Sinclair (1989) and Sinclair (1992).
  To achieve this, we develop a general framework for analyzing mixing times, combining ideas from the classic canonical path method with the "local-to-global" approaches recently developed in high-dimensional expanders, introducing key innovations to both techniques.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and edges in $G$, respectively. Tur\'{a}n's theorem states that in a simple $K_{r+1}$ free graph, $m \leq \frac{n^2(r-1)}{2r}$. In this paper, we generalize this result as follows: For each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the order of the largest clique that contains $v$. We show that \[ m \leq \frac{n}{2}\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{c(v)-1}{c(v)}\] Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality in this bound.</description>

      <title>Compact formulations and valid inequalities for parallel machine scheduling with conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of scheduling conflicting jobs on parallel machines consists in assigning a set of jobs to a set of machines so that no two conflicting jobs are allocated to the same machine, and the maximum processing time among all machines is minimized. We propose a new compact mixed integer linear formulation based on the representatives model for the vertex coloring problem, which overcomes a number of issues inherent in the natural assignment model. We present a polyhedral study of the associated polytope, and describe classes of valid inequalities inherited from the stable set polytope. We describe branch-and-cut algorithms for the problem, and report on computational experiments with benchmark instances. Our computational results on the hardest instances of the benchmark set show that the proposed algorithms are superior (either in running time or quality of the solutions) to the current state-of-the-art methods. We find that our new method performs better than the existing ones especially when the gap between the optimal value and the trivial lower bound (i.e., the sum of all processing times divided by the number of machines) increases.</description>

      <title>Graphs with unique Grundy dominating sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ consider a procedure of building a dominating set $D$ in $G$ by adding vertices to $D$ one at a time in such a way that whenever vertex $x$ is added to $D$ there exists a vertex $y\in N_G[x]$ that becomes dominated only after $x$ is added to $D$. The maximum cardinality of a set $D$ obtained in the described way is called the Grundy domination number of $G$ and $D$ a Grundy dominating set. While a Grundy dominating set of a connected graph $G$ is not unique unless $G$ is the trivial graph, we consider a natural weaker uniqueness condition, notably that for every two Grundy dominating sets in a graph $G$ there is an automorphism that maps one to the other. We investigate both versions of uniqueness for several concepts of Grundy domination, which appeared in the context of domination games and are also closely related to zero forcing. For each of the four variations of Grundy domination we characterize the graphs that have only one Grundy dominating set of the given type, and characterize those forests that enjoy the weaker (isomorphism based) condition of uniqueness. The latter characterizations lead to efficient algorithms for recognizing the corresponding classes of forests.</description>

      <title>Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Cutwidth Bounds via Vertex Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cutwidth measure on graphs and ways to bound the cutwidth of a graph by partitioning its vertices. We consider bounds expressed as a function of two quantities: on the one hand, the maximal cutwidth y of the subgraphs induced by the classes of the partition, and on the other hand, the cutwidth x of the quotient multigraph obtained by merging each class to a single vertex. We consider in particular the decomposition of directed graphs into strongly connected components (SCCs): in this case, y is the maximal cutwidth of an SCC, and x is the cutwidth of the directed acyclic condensation multigraph.
  We show that the cutwidth of a graph is always in O(x + y), specifically it can be upper bounded by 1.5x + y. We also show a lower bound justifying that the constant 1.5 cannot be improved in general</description>
