      <title>Isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem, formulated by Krasner in the 1950's, in the context of Polish (i.e. separable complete) ultrametric spaces by providing a characterization of their isometry groups using suitable forms of generalized wreath products of full permutation groups. Since our solution is developed in the finer context of topological (Polish) groups, it also solves a problem of Gao and Kechris from 2003. Furthermore, we provide an exact correspondence between the isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces belonging to some natural subclasses and various kinds of generalized wreath products proposed in the literature by Hall, Holland, and Malicki.</description>

      <title>Modeling FO-limits for monadically stable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a monadically stable theory $T$, a sufficiently saturated $\mathbf M \models T$, and a coherent system of probability measures on the $\sigma$-algebras generated by parameter-definable sets of $\mathbf M$ in each dimension, we may produce a totally Borel $\mathbf B \prec \mathbf M$ realizing these measures. Our main application is to prove that every FO-convergent sequence of structures (with countable signature) from a monadically stable class admits a modeling limit. As another consequence, we prove a Borel removal lemma for monadically stable Lebesgue relational structures.</description>

      <title>Examples and Nonexamples of Distal Metric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides examples of distal metric structures. One source of examples are metric valued fields. By analyzing indiscernible sequences, we show that real closed metric valued fields are distal, and conclude that algebraically closed metric valued fields, while stable, have the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property, which we define appropriately for metric structures.
  We find another example in topological dynamics: we study a metric structure whose automorphism group is the well-understood Polish group $\mathrm{Hom}^+([0,1])$ of increasing homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$. This was known to be NIP and highly unstable, and further properties were established in arXiv:1510.00238. We characterize models of its theory of this structure, which we call Dual Linear Continua, up to isomorphism. We analyze their indiscernible sequences and prove that they are distal, as well as constructing explicit distal cell decompositions.</description>

      <title>Anchored Implication &amp; Event-Indexed Fixed Points in Hilbert Spaces: Uniqueness and Quantitative Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a synthesis of orthomodular logic (projections as propositions) with operator fixed-point theory in Hilbert spaces. First, we introduce an anchored implication connective $A \Rightarrow^{\mathrm{comm}}_{P} B$, defined semantically so that it is true only when either $A$ is false or else $A$ is true and $B$ is true in a ''commuting'' context specified by a fixed nonzero projection $P$. This connective refines material implication by adding a side condition $[E_B,P]=0$ (commutation of $B$ with the anchor) and reduces to classical implication in the Boolean (commuting) case. Second, we study fixed-point convergence under event-indexed contractions. For a single nonexpansive (not necessarily linear) map $T$, we prove that the event-indexed condition is equivalent to the classical assertion that some power $T^N$ is a strict contraction; thus the ''irregular events'' phrasing does not add generality in that setting. We then present the genuinely more general case of varying operators (switching/randomized): if blocks of the evolving composition are contractive with bounded inter-event gaps and a common fixed point exists, we obtain uniqueness and an explicit envelope rate. Finally, with an anchor $P$ that commutes with $T$, the same reasoning ensures convergence on $PH$ under event-indexed contraction on that subspace. We include precise scope conditions, examples, and visual explanations.</description>

      <title>Countably-categorical Boolean rings with distinguished ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and classify countable Boolean rings (which may or may not have a multiplicative identity) with finitely many distinguished ideals whose elementary theory is countably categorical. This extends the description by Macintyre and Rosenstein and subsequent authors of countably categorical Boolean algebras with finitely many distinguished ideals. Following Pierce, we take a topological approach using the language of PO systems (partially ordered sets with a distinguished subset) and topological Boolean algebras. We provide two different classifications via invariants that uniquely determine the isomorphism type: one using finite PO systems and the other using finite posets. We discuss how our findings link with previous results, but the paper is otherwise self-contained.</description>

      <title>Borel distinguishing number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study definable variants of the notion of the distinguishing number of a graph in descriptive set theoretic setting. We introduce the notion of the Borel distinguishing number of a Borel graph and provide examples that separate distinguishing number and Borel distinguishing number at various levels. More specifically, we prove that there exist Borel graphs with countable distinguishing number but uncountable Borel distinguishing number and that, for every integer $n \geq 3$, there exists a Borel graph with distinguishing number $2$ whose Borel distinguishing number is finite and at least $n$.</description>

      <title>The ineffectiveness of the regularity lemma for bounded degree graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $\Delta \geq 3$, there is no bound computable from $(\varepsilon, r)$ on the size of a graph required to approximate a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ up to $\varepsilon$ error in $r$-neighborhood statistics. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Lov\'asz. Our result is a direct consequence of the recent celebrated work of Bowen, Chapman, Lubotzky, and Vidick, which refutes the Aldous-Lyons conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-Standard Models of Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homotopy type theory is a modern foundation for mathematics that introduces the univalence axiom and is particularly suitable for the study of homotopical mathematics and its formalization via proof assistants. In order to better comprehend the mathematical implications of homotopy type theory, a variety of models have been constructed and studied. Here a model is understood as a model category with suitable properties implementing the various type theoretical constructors and axioms. A first example is the simplicial model due to Kapulkin--Lumsdaine--Voevodsky. By now, many other models have been constructed, due to work of Arndt, Kapulkin, Lumsdaine, Warren and particularly Shulman, culminating in a proof that every Grothendieck $\infty$-topos can be obtained as the underlying $\infty$-category of a model category that models homotopy type theory.
  In this paper we propose the filter quotient construction as a new method to construct further models of homotopy type theory. Concretely, we prove that with minor assumptions, the filter quotient construction preserves all model categorical properties individually that implement various type theoretical constructors and axioms. On the other hand, the filter quotient construction does not preserve many external properties that are of set theoretical nature, such as cocompleteness, local presentability or cofibrant generation. Combining these, the filter quotient construction preserves models of homotopy type theory and can result in models that have not been considered before and exhibit behaviors that diverge from any of the established models.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Homotopy Type Theory is not just Simplicial: What are $\infty$-Categories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\infty$-category theory was originally developed in the context of classical homotopy theory using standard set theoretical assumptions, but has since been extended to a variety of mathematical foundations. One such successful effort, primarily due to Martini and Wolf, introduced a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to the foundation of an arbitrary Grothendieck $\infty$-topos, meaning they used categorical foundations. Another approach, due to Riehl and Shulman, developed a theory of $\infty$-categories internal to their own type theory: simplicial homotopy type theory (sHoTT), meaning they employed a (homotopy) type theoretic foundation.
  One aspect of developing a theory of $\infty$-categories in different foundations consists of introducing ways to translate from one foundation to another. Concretely, as part of their work, Riehl and Shulman prove that $\infty$-categories internal to Grothendieck $\infty$-topoi give us categorical models of sHoTT. In fact the name ``simplicial'' in sHoTT suggests that all categorical models of sHoTT should be given by simplicial objects in suitable $\infty$-categories. In this paper we prove that contrary to this expectation, there are models of sHoTT that are not simply simplicial objects. This suggests that in a general foundations, the notion of $\infty$-category is more general than previously assumed.</description>
