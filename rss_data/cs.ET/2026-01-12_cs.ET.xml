      <title>Investigation of Hardware Architecture Effects on Quantum Algorithm Performance: A Comparative Hardware Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.
  In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.
  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Multi-Image Super Resolution Framework for Detection and Analysis of Plant Roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.</description>
