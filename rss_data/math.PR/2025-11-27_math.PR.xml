      <title>Double $q$-Wigner Chaos and the Fourth Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Fourth Moment Theorem for sequences of (noncommutative) random variables given as sums of two stochastic integrals in two different parity orders of chaos, both in the free Wigner chaos setting and a $q$-Gaussian generalization. Specifically, we prove that convergence to the appropriate central limit distribution is mediated entirely by the behavior of the first four (mixed) moments of the two stochastic integrals, which in turn controls the $L^2$ norms of partial integral contractions of those kernels. The key step in both the free and $q$-Gaussian settings is a polarization identity for fourth cumulants of sums which holds only when the two terms have differing parities. These results are analogous to the recent preprint Fourth-Moment Theorems for Sums of Multiple Integrals by Basse-O'Connor, Kramer-Bang, and Svedsen in the classical Wiener-It\^o chaos setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Curve Shortening Flow with Scale-Dependent Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion by mean curvature of curves in the plane perturbed by scale-dependent noise. We first introduce a so-called scale-dependent noise from the physics background to the curve shortening flow. To be more precise, the scale-dependent noise defined on a curve is a noise whose intensity is proportional to the length of the curve. To get the well-posedness of stochastic curve shortening flow driven by scale-dependent noise, we equivalently formulate the stochastic curve shortening flow as a one-phase stochastic Stefan problem of its curvature parameterized by the arclength parameter and its length. After rewriting the one-phase stochastic Stefan problem as a quasilinear evolution equation, we apply the theory for quaslinear stochastic evolution equations developed by Agresti and Veraar in 2022 to get maximal unique local strong solution for the stochastic curve shortening flow up to a maximal stopping time which is characterized by a blow-up criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Benamou-Brenier formula from classical optimal transport to weak optimal transport and show that the barycentric optimal transport problem studied by Gozlan and Juillet has a dynamic analogue. We also investigate a martingale relaxation of this problem, and relate it to the martingale Benamou-Brenier formula of Backhoff-Veraguas, Beiglb\"ock, Huesmann and K\"allblad.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the Success Probability in the Odds Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bruss's odds theorem \cite{Bruss1} addresses the problem of determining the optimal stopping time for sequences of independent indicator functions. In this note, we derive upper and lower bounds for the success probability under the optimal stopping rule. These bounds depend on the number of independent events under consideration and on a deterministic index specifying the stopping time. Moreover, the bounds are sharp: we provide explicit examples in which the corresponding inequalities are attained with equality.</description>

      <title>A simple proof of local universality for roots of Kac polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_n$ be a random polynomial of degree $n$ with i.i.d.\ mean-zero and finite variance random coefficients. It is well known that the roots of $f_n$ cluster uniformly around the unit circle as $n$ grows large. We give a simple and self-contained proof of local universality for the correlation functions of the roots at the microscopic scale $1/n$ around a fixed point on the circle. While previous proofs of local universality were focused on studying the logarithmic potential of $f_n$, we instead directly compare the scaled random polynomial to a limiting Gaussian analytic function, and establish convergence of correlations via a soft argument, using only basic complex analysis and an anti-concentration bound of Esseen.</description>

      <title>Markov properties for the vertical edge profile in random labelled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a broad class of random labelled trees in which integer-valued labels evolve along the edges according to increments in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. These models include e.g. branching random walks, embedded complete and incomplete binary trees, random Cayley and plane trees with uniform displacements along edges. Motivated by recent work suggesting a Markovian structure in the vertical profile of such trees, we introduce the vertical edge profile, which counts both oriented edges connecting label $k-1$ to label $k$ and oriented edges connecting label $k$ to label $k-1$.
  We show that the vertical edge profile forms a time-homogeneous Markov chain for a wide class of models, and this remains true (provided we enrich this process by the total mass of the tree below each label) if we condition on the total size of the tree. We give explicit transition kernels in the case of labelled incomplete binary trees, which are closely related to known enumeration formulas. To establish these results, we study a decomposition of labelled trees into excursions above and below fixed label levels, yielding a forest structure with tractable probabilistic laws.
  We further explain briefly how these findings connect to the theory of super-Brownian motion and the Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion (ISE). In a companion paper, we show that the vertical edge profile converges, after rescaling,to the local time and its derivative of Brownian motion indexed by the Brownian tree.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Optimal local central limit theorems on Wiener chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a local central limit theorem for a normalized sequence of random variables belonging to a fixed order Wiener chaos and converging to the standard normal distribution. We prove, without imposing any additional conditions, that the optimal rate of convergence of their density functions to the standard normal density in the Sobolev space $W^{k,r}(\mathbb{R})$, for every $k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and $r \in [1,\infty]$, is determined by the maximum of the absolute values of their third and fourth cumulants. We also obtain exact asymptotics for this convergence under an additional assumption. Our approach is based on Malliavin--Stein techniques combined with tools from the theory of generalized functionals in Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <title>Metastability of diffusion processes in narrow tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the metastable behavior of diffusion processes in narrow tube domains, where the metastability is induced by entropic barriers. We identify a sequence of characteristic time scales $\{T_\epsilon^i\}_{1 \leq i \leq \abs{V'}}$ and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the diffusion process both at intermediate time scales and at the first critical time scale. Our analysis relies on a refined understanding of the narrow escape problem in domains with bottlenecks, in particular on estimates for the exit place and on the conditional distribution of the exit time given the exit place, results that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The Exact Limsup Constant for Once-Visited Sites of One-Dimensional Simple Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a one-dimensional simple random walk, let $g_1(n)$ denote the number of sites visited exactly once at time $n$. Major (1988) proved that $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_1(n)}{\log^2n}=C\qquad a.s.$$ where $C$ is a positive and finite constant. While this result settled the question of existence, the value of $C$ remained unknown.
  In this paper, we determine that $C=1/16$. The main novelty of our work lies in introducing a self-boosting iterative framework for analysis.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control of Interacting Particle Systems in Hilbert Spaces and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of interacting particles governed by stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces is an open area of research. Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Intensity doubling for Brownian loop-soups in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an intensity doubling feature of critical Brownian loop-soups on the cable-graphs of ${\mathbb Z}^d$ for $d \ge 7$ that can be described as follows: In the box $[-N, N]^d$ (and with a probability that goes to $1$ as $N$ goes to infinity), the set of all clusters of Brownian loops that do contain proper self-avoiding cycles of diameter comparable to $N$ can be decomposed into two identically distributed families: (a) The collection of clusters that do contain a large Brownian loop from the loop-soup (and therefore do automatically contain such a large cycle) (b) The collection of clusters that contain no macroscopic loop from the loop-soup (more specifically, no loop of diameter greater than $N^{\beta}$ when $\beta &gt; 4/ (d-2)$ is fixed) but nevertheless contain a large cycle. In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent "ghost" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity. This result had been conjectured by the first author in arXiv:2209.07901 [math.PR] ; our proof builds heavily on the second author's switching property for such loop-soups from arXiv:2502.06754 [math.PR] .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness for a one-dimensional multivalued backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. The equation involves a time-indexed family of maximal monotone operators $k_t(\cdot)$ associated with increasing functions $k(t,\cdot)$ taking values in $\mathbb{R}_-$ and having domains that are intervals with time-dependent boundaries. Existence is obtained by a penalization method under a Lipschitz condition on the driver in $(y,z)$, a monotonicity condition in the jump parameter $\psi$, square-integrability of the terminal condition and the driver, and local-in-time integrability conditions on $k(\cdot,y)$. We also address the extension to the case where the operators $k_t(\cdot)$ act on unbounded intervals.</description>

      <title>Option market making with hedging-induced market impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a model for option market making in which the hedging activity of the market maker generates price impact on the underlying asset. The option order flow is modeled by Cox processes, with intensities depending on the state of the underlying and on the market maker's quoted prices. The resulting dynamics combine stochastic option demand with both permanent and transient impact on the underlying, leading to a coupled evolution of inventory and price. We first study market manipulation and arbitrage phenomena that may arise from the feedback between option trading and underlying impact. We then establish the well-posedness of the mixed control problem, which involves continuous quoting decisions and impulsive hedging actions. Finally, we implement a numerical method based on policy optimization to approximate optimal strategies and illustrate the interplay between option market liquidity, inventory risk, and underlying impact.</description>

      <title>Optimal dividend and capital injection under self-exciting claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal dividend and capital-injection problem in a Cram\'er--Lundberg model where claim arrivals follow a Hawkes process, capturing clustering effects often observed in insurance portfolios. We establish key analytical properties of the value function and characterise the optimal capital-injection strategy through an explicit threshold. We also show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated HJB variational inequality. For numerical purposes, we first compute a benchmark solution via a monotone finite-difference scheme with Howard's policy iteration. We then develop a reinforcement learning approach based on policy-gradient and actor-critic methods. The learned strategies closely match the PDE benchmark and remain stable across initial conditions. The results highlight the relevance of policy-gradient techniques for dividend optimisation under self-exciting claim dynamics and point toward scalable methods for higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Expectation: Concentration Inequalities for Randomized Iterative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic iterative methods are useful in a variety of large-scale numerical linear algebraic, machine learning, and statistical problems, in part due to their low-memory footprint. They are frequently used in a variety of applications, and thus it is imperative to have a thorough theoretical understanding of their behavior. Most theoretical convergence results for stochastic iterative methods provide bounds on the expected error of the iterates, and yield a type of average case analysis. However, understanding the behavior of these methods in the near-worst-case is desirable. For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error.
  Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the Expected Duration of a Generalized Bingo Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the expected number of calls required to achieve Bingo in a generalized (n,m)-Bingo game, where each n x n card is filled by sampling n numbers from m possible values per column. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, we derive exact formulas for the probability distribution and the expected game length. Our main theoretical result proves that the expected number of calls is a linear function of m.</description>

      <title>A study of the metric measure space of probability measures via a purely atomic superposition principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the continuity equation on the metric measure space $(\mathcal{P}_p(X),W_p,Q)$, when $X$ is either the Euclidean space or a compact, oriented, and boundaryless Riemannian manifold, for some suitable reference measure $Q \in \mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(X))$, which by construction are concentrated over purely atomic measures. In fact, we consider the equation $\partial_t M_t +\operatorname{div}_{\mathcal{P}}(b_t M_t) = 0$, where $(M_t)_{t\in[0,T]} \subset\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(X))$ and $b:[0,T]\times X \times \mathcal{P}(X) \to TX$, assuming that $M_t\ll Q$ for all $t\in[0,T]$, to then show when the purely atomic property is inherited by the liftings of the curve $M_t$ given by the nested superposition principle.
  On the Euclidean space, the main assumption is that the $r$-capacity of the diagonal $\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d$ is zero with respect to $\nu \otimes \nu$, where $\nu$ is the barycenter of the reference measure $Q$. We will give sufficient conditions to ensure it, and in particular, thanks to the Nash embedding theorem, this analysis will allow us to extent the main results from the Euclidean space to Riemannian manifolds.
  Finally, we exploit this atomic superposition principle to show the lack of the Sobolev-to-Lipschitz property and the Poincar\'e inequality for functions in $W^{1,p}(\mathcal{P}_p(X),W_p,Q)$. Then, we complete the analysis showing that, however, the $L^2$-Wasserstein space endowed with suitable reference measure $Q$, satisfies a Bakry--\'Emery curvature condition.</description>

      <title>A Dynamics-Informed Gaussian Process Framework for 2D Stochastic Navier-Stokes via Quasi-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proof of quasi-Gaussianity for the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes (SNS) equations by Coe, Hairer, and Tolomeo establishes that the system's unique invariant measure is equivalent (mutually absolutely continuous) to the Gaussian measure of its corresponding linear Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.
  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition for Stochastic Block Model with more than $\sqrt{n}$ Communities (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental theoretical question in network analysis is to determine under which conditions community recovery is possible in polynomial time in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.
  When $K \geq \sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \geq \sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.
  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \geq \sqrt{n}$ communities. They also indicate that, in moderately sparse regimes, the optimal algorithms appear to be fundamentally different from spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of robustness in modern Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible approach to approximate sampling from intractable probability distributions, with a rich theoretical foundation and comprising a wealth of exemplar algorithms. While the qualitative correctness of MCMC algorithms is often easy to ensure, their practical efficiency is contingent on the `target' distribution being reasonably well-behaved.
  In this work, we concern ourself with the scenario in which this good behaviour is called into question, reviewing an emerging line of work on `robust' MCMC algorithms which can perform acceptably even in the face of certain pathologies.
  We focus on two particular pathologies which, while simple, can already have dramatic effects on standard `local' algorithms. The first is roughness, whereby the target distribution varies so rapidly that the numerical stability of the algorithm is tenuous. The second is flatness, whereby the landscape of the target distribution is instead so barren and uninformative that one becomes lost in uninteresting parts of the state space. In each case, we formulate the pathology in concrete terms, review a range of proposed algorithmic remedies to the pathology, and outline promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Mean-square exponential stability of exact and numerical solutions for neutral stochastic delay differential equations with Markovian switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the mean-square exponential stability of neutral stochastic differential delay equations (NSDDEs) with Markovian switching. The analysis addresses the complexities arising from the interaction between the neutral term, time-varying delays, and structural changes governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. We establish novel and practical criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of both the underlying system and its numerical approximations via the Euler-Maruyama method. Furthermore, we prove that the numerical scheme can reproduce the exponential decay rate of the true solution with arbitrary accuracy, provided the step size is sufficiently small. The theoretical results are supported by a numerical example that illustrates their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Eigenvector Nonorthogonality in Complex Symmetric Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian random matrices with statistical spectral characteristics beyond the standard Ginibre ensembles have recently emerged in the description of dissipative quantum many-body systems as well as in non-ergodic wave transport in complex media. We investigate the class AI$^\dag$ of complex symmetric random matrices, for which available analytic results remain scarce. Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class. This behavior is expected to be universal, as further supported by numerical evidence for Bernoulli random matrices.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the set of lumpable Markov chains over a finite state space, with respect to a fixed lumping function, generally does not form an exponential family of stochastic matrices. In this work, we explore efficiently verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for families of lumpable transition matrices to form exponential families. To this end, we develop a broadly applicable dimension-based method for determining whether a given family of stochastic matrices forms an exponential family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit error bound for convolution powers of laws with finite moments of order $r \in \mathopen]2,3\mathclose]$, taking a closeness of the laws to normality into account. Up to a universal constant, this generalises the case of $r=3$ of the sharpening of the Berry (1941) - Esseen (1942) theorem obtained by Mattner (2024), namely by sharpening here the Katz (1963) error bound for the i.i.d. case of Lyapunov's (1901) theorem. Our proof uses a partial generalisation of the theorem of Senatov and Zolotarev (1986) used for the earlier special case. A result more general than our main one could be obtained by using instead another theorem of Senatov (1980), but unfortunately an auxiliary inequality used in the latter's proof is wrong.</description>

      <title>Queueing models with random resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study some queueing models with random resetting, including Markovian and non--Markovian models. The Markovian models include M/M/$\infty$, M/M/r and M/M/1+M queues with random resetting, in which a continuous-time Markov chain is formulated, with transitions including a resetting to state zero in addition to arrivals and services. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the queueing processes in these models by using parting balance equations. Although the stationary distribution for M/M/$\infty$ queue with resetting has been previously derived in the literature, we obtain an alternative and more interpretable expression by a different approach. That provides useful insights for the analysis of M/M/r and M/M/1+M queues with resetting under the first-come first-served (FCFS) discipline.
  The non--Markovian models include GI/GI/1, GI/GI/$r$ and GI/GI/$\infty$ queues with random resetting to state zero at arrival times. For GI/GI/1 and GI/GI/$r$ queues under the FCFS discipline, we introduce modified Lindley and Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursions, respectively. Using an operator representation for these recursions, we characterize the stationary distributions via convergent series, as solutions to the modified Wiener--Hopf equations. For GI/GI/$\infty$ queues with resettings, we utilize a version of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursion, and also characterize the corresponding stationary distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting where we have $n$ independent observations of a random variable $X$, we derive explicit error bounds in total variation distance when approximating the number of observations equal to the maximum of the sample (in the case where $X$ is discrete) or the number of observations within a given distance of an order statistic of the sample (in the case where $X$ is absolutely continuous). The logarithmic and Poisson distributions are used as approximations in the discrete case, with proofs which include the development of Stein's method for a logarithmic target distribution. In the absolutely continuous case our approximations are by the negative binomial distribution, and are established by considering negative binomial approximation for mixed binomials. The cases where $X$ is geometric, Gumbel and uniform are used as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Infinite-time Mean Field FBSDEs and Viscosity Solutions to Elliptic Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a further investigation of the properties of infinite-time mean field FBSDEs and elliptic master equations, which were introduced in \cite{yang2025discounted} as mathematical tools for solving discounted infinite-time mean field games. By establishing the continuous dependence of the FBSDE solutions on their initial values, we prove the flow property of the mean field FBSDEs. Furthermore, we prove that, at the Nash equilibrium, the value function of the representative player constitutes a viscosity solution to the corresponding elliptic master equation. Our work extends the classical theory of finite-time mean field games and parabolic master equations to the infinite-time setting.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.</description>

      <title>A note on quantum expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>On the reduction of stochastic chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear noise approximation (LNA) describes the random fluctuations from the mean-field concentrations of a chemical reaction network due to intrinsic noise. It is also used as a test probe to determine the accuracy of reduced formulations of the chemical master equation and to understand the relationship between timescale disparity and model reduction in stochastic environments. Although several reduced LNAs have been proposed, they have not been placed into a general theory concerning the accuracy of reduced LNAs derived from center manifold and singular perturbation theory. This has made it difficult to understand why certain reductions of the master or Langevin equations fail or succeed. In this work, we develop a deeper understanding of slow manifold projection in the linear noise regime by answering a straightforward but open question: In the presence of eigenvalue disparity, does the appropriate oblique projection of the LNA onto the slow eigenspace accurately approximate the first and second moments of complete LNA, and if not, why? Although most studies concentrate on the role of eigenvalue disparity arising from the drift matrix, we go further and examine the interplay between disparate ``drift" eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix, the latter of which may or may not be disparate. Furthermore, we place the previously established reductions of the LNA into a more general framework and formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the projected LNA to accurately approximate the first and second moments of the complete LNA.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

      <title>On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations(FBSDEs). By employing the elliptic master equations, a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs , we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium. We prove the Yamada-Watanabe theorem and show the weak uniqueness for infinite-time FBSDEs. And we prove that the solutions to a system of infinite-time FBSDEs can be employed to construct viscosity solutions for a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>An identity involving counts of binary matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of generating uniform random contingency tables with pre-specified marginals, the number of (binary) matrices with given row- and column-sums is a well-studied object in the literature. We will denote this number by $N(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the vectors of row- and column-sums. The existing literature is mainly focused on computing or approximating $N(p,q)$. In this paper, we present two identities for polynomials whose coefficients depend on the $N(p,q)$ and explore some consequences.</description>
