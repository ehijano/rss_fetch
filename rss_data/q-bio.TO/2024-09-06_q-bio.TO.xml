      <title>Explainable AI for computational pathology identifies model limitations and tissue biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in histopathology image analysis, but their opaque decision-making process poses challenges in high-risk medical scenarios. Here we introduce HIPPO, an explainable AI method that interrogates attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) models in computational pathology by generating counterfactual examples through tissue patch modifications in whole slide images. Applying HIPPO to ABMIL models trained to detect breast cancer metastasis reveals that they may overlook small tumors and can be misled by non-tumor tissue, while attention maps$\unicode{x2014}$widely used for interpretation$\unicode{x2014}$often highlight regions that do not directly influence predictions. By interpreting ABMIL models trained on a prognostic prediction task, HIPPO identified tissue areas with stronger prognostic effects than high-attention regions, which sometimes showed counterintuitive influences on risk scores. These findings demonstrate HIPPO's capacity for comprehensive model evaluation, bias detection, and quantitative hypothesis testing. HIPPO greatly expands the capabilities of explainable AI tools to assess the trustworthy and reliable development, deployment, and regulation of weakly-supervised models in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Role of Data-driven Regional Growth Model in Shaping Brain Folding Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface morphology of the developing mammalian brain is crucial for understanding brain function and dysfunction. Computational modeling offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for early brain folding. Recent findings indicate significant regional variations in brain tissue growth, while the role of these variations in cortical development remains unclear. In this study, we unprecedently explored how regional cortical growth affects brain folding patterns using computational simulation. We first developed growth models for typical cortical regions using machine learning (ML)-assisted symbolic regression, based on longitudinal real surface expansion and cortical thickness data from prenatal and infant brains derived from over 1,000 MRI scans of 735 pediatric subjects with ages ranging from 29 post-menstrual weeks to 24 months. These models were subsequently integrated into computational software to simulate cortical development with anatomically realistic geometric models. We comprehensively quantified the resulting folding patterns using multiple metrics such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, and gyrification index. Our results demonstrate that regional growth models generate complex brain folding patterns that more closely match actual brains structures, both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared to conventional uniform growth models. Growth magnitude plays a dominant role in shaping folding patterns, while growth trajectory has a minor influence. Moreover, multi-region models better capture the intricacies of brain folding than single-region models. Our results underscore the necessity and importance of incorporating regional growth heterogeneity into brain folding simulations, which could enhance early diagnosis and treatment of cortical malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy and autism.</description>
