      <title>A model structure on the category of A$_\infty$-categories with strict morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category of (strictly unital) A$_\infty$-categories, linear over a commutative ring $R$, with strict A$_\infty$-morphisms has a cofibrantly generated model structure. In this model structure every object is fibrant and the cofibrant objects have cofibrant morphisms. As a consequence we prove that the semi-free A$_\infty$-categories (resp. resolutions) are cofibrant objects (resp. resolution) in this model structure.</description>

      <title>Hopf categories associated to comonoidal functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit construction of Hopf categories associated to comonoidal functors, generalizing \v{S}evera's construction of Hopf monoids through M-adapted functors. We discuss the example of the Hopf category whose underlying class is the set of twists of a Lie bialgebra. Finally, we apply the result to the setting of deformed categories.</description>

      <title>Graphs With Polarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fields ranging from business to systems biology, directed graphs with edges labeled by signs are used to model systems in a simple way: the nodes represent entities of some sort, and an edge indicates that one entity directly affects another either positively or negatively. Multiplying the signs along a directed path of edges lets us determine indirect positive or negative effects, and if the path is a loop we call this a positive or negative feedback loop. Here we generalize this to graphs with edges labeled by a monoid, whose elements represent `polarities' possibly more general than simply "positive" or "negative". We study three notions of morphism between graphs with labeled edges, each with its own distinctive application: to refine a simple graph into a complicated one, to transform a complicated graph into a simple one, and to find recurring patterns called "motifs". We construct three corresponding symmetric monoidal double categories of "open" graphs. We study feedback loops using a generalization of the homology of a graph to homology with coefficients in a commutative monoid. In particular, we describe the emergence of new feedback loops when we compose open graphs using a variant of the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence for homology with coefficients in a commutative monoid.</description>

      <title>When are exact categories co-exact?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that opposite category of a cocomplete pretopos is ideally exact and arithmetical. We do this by showing that there are conditions common to additive and lextensive categories which, in the exact context, imply that: pushouts of monomorphisms along arbitrary morphisms exist and are pullbacks; monomorphisms are stable under pushout; co-reflexive-relations are co-effective-equivalence-relations; and coprotomodularity holds.</description>

      <title>Large condensation in enriched $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the language of enriched $\infty$-categories, we formalize and generalize the definition of fusion n-category, and an analogue of iterative condensation of $E_i$-algebras. The former was introduced by Johnson-Freyd, and the latter by Kong, Zhang, Zhao, and Zheng. This extends categorical condensation beyond fusion n-categories to all enriched monoidal $\infty$-categories with certain colimits. The resulting theory is capable of treating symmetries of arbitrary dimension and codimension that are enriched, continuous, derived, non-semisimple and non-separable. Additionally, we consider a truncated variant of the notion of condensation introduced by Gaiotto and Johnson-Freyd, and show that iterative condensation of monoidal monads and $E_i$-algebras provide examples. In doing so, we prove results on functoriality of Day convolution for enriched $\infty$-categories, and monoidality of two versions of the Eilenberg-Moore functor, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Doubly weak double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of double categories whose composition of 1-cells is weak in both directions. Namely, a doubly weak double category is a double computad -- a structure with 2-cells of all possible double-categorical shapes -- equipped with all possible composition operations, coherently. We also characterize them using "implicit" double categories, which are double computads having all possible compositions of 2-cells, but no compositions of 1-cells; doubly weak double categories are then obtained by a simple representability criterion. Finally, they can also be defined by adding a "tidiness" condition to the double bicategories of Verity, or to the cubical bicategories of Garner.</description>

      <title>Extending conceptual completeness via virtual ultracategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of virtual ultracategory. From a topological point of view, this notion can be seen as a categorification of relational $\beta$-algebras. From a categorical point of view, virtual ultracategories generalize ultracategories in the same way that multicategories generalize monoidal categories. From a logical point of view, whereas the points of a coherent topos form an ultracategory, the points of an arbitrary topos form a virtual ultracategory. We then extend Makkai--Lurie's conceptual completeness: a topos with enough points can be reconstructed from its virtual ultracategory of points.</description>

      <title>Higher path groupoids and the holonomy of formal power series connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on ideas of Kohno, we develop a framework for the construction of higher holonomy functors via the transport of formal power series connections. Using these techniques, we obtain functors from the path groupoid, the path 2-groupoid, and the path 3-groupoid of a manifold. As an application, we construct a Gray functor from the path 3-groupoid of the configuration space of $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geqslant 4$.</description>

      <title>The Rouquier dimension of the category of perfect complexes over a regular ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Rouquier dimension of the category of perfect complexes over a regular ring is precisely the Krull dimension of the ring. Previously, it was known that the Krull dimension is an upper bound, the lower bound however was not known in general. In particular, for regular local rings this result is new. More generally, we show that a lower bound of the Rouquier dimension is given by the maximal length of a regular sequence.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda .</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Stable Infinity Categories with Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 2000s, Balmer constructed a ringed space from a triangulated category with a tensor structure. It provides a beautiful classification of tensor ideals. However, some categories, such as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves or the triangulated category of singularities of a scheme, do not have canonical tensor structures. We constructed a ringed space from a stable infinity category with action as an analog. The aforementioned examples have canonical action of the category of perfect complexes, and their associated spaces contain information about the singularities of the scheme.
  Recently, Matsui introduced a ringed space from a triangulated category. However, it can be huge and hard to calculate. Our approach describes subspaces of the Matsui spectrum, which is more manageable due to their fiber decomposition.</description>

      <title>Global representation theory: Homological foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A global representation is a compatible collection of representations of the outer automorphism groups of the groups belonging to some collection of finite groups $\mathscr{U}$. Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work.</description>
