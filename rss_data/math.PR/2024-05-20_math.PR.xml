      <title>Subtractive random forests with two choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are pivotal in aiding users amid vast online content. Broutin, Devroye, Lugosi, and Oliveira proposed Subtractive Random Forests (\textsc{surf}), a model that emphasizes temporal user preferences. Expanding on \textsc{surf}, we introduce a model for a multi-choice recommendation system, enabling users to select from two independent suggestions based on past interactions. We evaluate its effectiveness and robustness across diverse scenarios, incorporating heavy-tailed distributions for time delays. By analyzing user topic evolution, we assess the system's consistency. Our study offers insights into the performance and potential enhancements of multi-choice recommendation systems in practical settings.</description>

      <title>A stochastic version of the Hopfield-Ninio kinetic proofreading model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a simple stochastic version of the Hopfield-Ninio kinetic proofreading model. The model is characterized by means of two parameters, the unbinding time, which depends on the binding energy between a ligand and a receptor, and the number of times $M \geq 1$ that a ligand attaches to a receptor. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on M, our model has an extreme specificity, i.e. it is capable to discriminate between different ligands, and a high sensitivity, i.e. the response of the system does not change in a significant manner for ranges of ligands varying within several orders of magnitude. Additional quantities like the amount of energy used by the network or the time required to yield a response will be also computed. We also show that our results are robust, i.e., they do not depend on the specific choice of parameters that we make in this paper.</description>

      <title>A \emph{$\Gamma$}-convergence of level-two large deviation for metastable systems: The case of zero-range processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between the precise asymptotics of the level-two large deviation rate function and the behavior of metastable stochastic systems. Initially identified for overdamped Langevin dynamics (Ges{\`u} et al., \textit{SIAM J Math Anal} 49(4), 3048-3072, 2017), this connection has been validated across various models, including random walks in a potential field. We extend this connection to condensing zero-range processes, a complex interacting particle system.
  Specifically, we investigate a certain class of zero-range processes on a fixed graph $G$ with $N &gt; 0$ particles and interaction parameter $\alpha &gt; 1$. On the time scale $N^2$, this process behaves like an absorbing-type diffusion and converges to a condensed state where all particles occupy a single vertex of $G$ as $N$ approaches infinity. Once condensed, on the time scale $N^{1+\alpha}$, the condensed site moves according to a Markov chain on $G$, showing metastable behavior among condensed states. The time scales $N^2$ and $N^{1+\alpha}$ are called the pre-metastable and metastable time scales. It is conjectured that this behavior is encapsulated in the level-two large deviation rate function $\mathcal{I}_N$ of the zero-range process. Specifically, it is expected that the $\Gamma$-expansion of $\mathcal{I}_N$ can be expressed as:$$\mathcal{I}_N = \frac{1}{N^2} \mathcal{K} + \frac{1}{N^{1+\alpha}} \mathcal{J},$$ where $\mathcal{K}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are the level-two large deviation rate functions of the absorbing diffusion processes and the Markov chain on $G$. We rigorously prove this $\Gamma$-expansion by developing a methodology for $\Gamma$-convergence in the pre-metastable time scale and establishing a link between the resolvent approach to metastability (Landim et al., \textit{J Eur Math Soc}, 2023. \texttt{arXiv:2102.00998}) and the $\Gamma$-expansion in the metastable time scale.</description>

      <title>Deterministic computation of quantiles in a Lipschitz framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, our focus lies on computing the quantiles of a random variable $f(X)$, where $X$ is a $[0,1]^d$-valued random variable, $d \in \mathbb{N}^{\ast}$, and $f:[0,1]^d\to \mathbb{R}$ is a deterministic Lipschitz function. We are particularly interested in scenarios where the cost of a single function call is high, while assuming the law of $X$ is known. In this context, we propose a deterministic algorithm to obtain exact deterministic lower and upper bounds for the quantile of $f(X)$ at a given level $\alpha \in (0,1)$. With a fixed budget of $N$ function calls, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves exponential convergence rate for $d=1$ ($\sim \rho^N$ with $\rho \in (0,1)$) and polynomial convergence rate for $d&gt;1$ ($\sim N^{-\frac{1}{d-1}}$) and show the optimality of those rates within the class of deterministic algorithms. Furthermore, we design two algorithms based on whether the Lipschitz constant of $f$ is known or unknown.</description>

      <title>Conditional indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a large class of (so-called) conditional indicators, on a complete probability space with respect to a sub $\sigma$-algebra. A conditional indicator is a positive mapping, which is not necessary linear, but may share common features with the conditional expectation, such as the tower property or the projection property. Several characterizations are formulated. Beyond the definitions, we provide some non trivial examples that are used in finance and may inspire new developments in the theory of operators on Riesz spaces.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound is applicable to high contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument, and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Convergence of the Continuous-Time JSQ System with General Distributions in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) system with general interarrival and service distributions. Under a much weaker assumption than the one in the literature, we prove that each station's scaled steady-state queue length weakly converges to an identical exponential random variable in heavy traffic. Specifically, we establish our results by only assuming $2+\delta_0$ moment on the arrival and service distributions for some $\delta_0&gt;0$. Our proof exploits the Palm version of the basic adjoint relationship (BAR) approach as a key technique.</description>

      <title>Hawkes Models And Their Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawkes process is a model for counting the number of arrivals to a system which exhibits the self-exciting property - that one arrival creates a heightened chance of further arrivals in the near future. The model, and its generalizations, have been applied in a plethora of disparate domains, though two particularly developed applications are in seismology and in finance. As the original model is elegantly simple, generalizations have been proposed which: track marks for each arrival, are multivariate, have a spatial component, are driven by renewal processes, treat time as discrete, and so on. This paper creates a cohesive review of the traditional Hawkes model and the modern generalizations, providing details on their construction, simulation algorithms, and giving key references to the appropriate literature for a detailed treatment.</description>

      <title>Future Aware Safe Active Learning of Time Varying Systems using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental exploration of high-cost systems with safety constraints, common in engineering applications, is a challenging endeavor. Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</description>

      <title>Localization and unique continuation for non-stationary Schr\"odinger operators on the 2D lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend methods of Ding and Smart from their breakthrough paper in 2020 which showed Anderson localization for certain random Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ via a quantitative unique continuation principle and Wegner estimate. We replace the requirement of identical distribution with the requirement of a uniform bound on the essential range of potential and a uniform positive lower bound on the variance of the variables giving the potential. Under those assumptions, we recover the unique continuation and Wegner lemma results, using Bernoulli decompositions and modifications of the arguments therein. This leads to a localization result at the bottom of the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix $k\geq 2$, choose $\frac{\log n}{n^{(k-1)/k}}\leq p\leq 1-\Omega(\frac{\log^4 n}{n})$, and consider $G\sim G(n,p)$. For any pair of vertices $v,w\in V(G)$, we give a simple and precise formula for the expected number of steps that a random walk on $G$ starting at $w$ needs to first arrive at $v$. The formula only depends on basic structural properties of $G$. This improves and extends recent results of Ottolini and Steinerberger, as well as Ottolini, who considered this problem for constant as well as for mildly vanishing $p$.</description>

      <title>Fast Collision Probability Estimation for Automated Driving using Multi-circular Shape Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art methods for safety assessment and motion planning for automated driving require estimation of the probability of collision (POC). To estimate the POC, a shape approximation of the colliding actors and probability density functions of the associated uncertain kinematic variables are required. Even with such information available, the derivation of the POC is in general, i.e., for any shape and density, only possible with Monte Carlo sampling (MCS). Random sampling of the POC, however, is challenging as computational resources are limited in real-world applications. We present expressions for the POC in the presence of Gaussian uncertainties, based on multi-circular shape approximations. In addition, we show that the proposed approach is computationally more efficient than MCS. Lastly, we provide a method for upper and lower bounding the estimation error for the POC induced by the used shape approximations.</description>

      <title>Non trivial optimal sampling rate for estimating a Lipschitz-continuous function in presence of mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that perturbs an unknown Lipschitz-continuous drift and aim to estimate the drift's value at a predetermined time horizon by sampling the path of the process. Due to the time varying nature of the drift we propose an estimation procedure that involves an online, time-varying optimization scheme implemented using a stochastic gradient ascent algorithm to maximize the log-likelihood of our observations. The objective of the paper is to investigate the optimal sample size/rate for achieving the minimum mean square distance between our estimator and the true value of the drift. In this setting we uncover a trade-off between the correlation of the observations, which increases with the sample size, and the dynamic nature of the unknown drift, which is weakened by increasing the frequency of observation. The mean square error is shown to be non monotonic in the sample size, attaining a global minimum whose precise description depends on the parameters that govern the model. In the static case, i.e. when the unknown drift is constant, our method outperforms the arithmetic mean of the observations in highly correlated regimes, despite the latter being a natural candidate estimator. We then compare our online estimator with the global maximum likelihood estimator.</description>

      <title>Non-reversible stationary states for majority voter and Ising dynamics on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three Markov processes on infinite, unrooted, regular trees: the stochastic Ising model (also known as the Glauber heat bath dynamics of the Ising model), a majority voter dynamic, and a coalescing particle model. In each of the three cases the tree exhibits a preferred direction encoded into the model. For all three models, our main result is the existence of a stationary but non-reversible measure. For the Ising model, this requires imposing that the inverse temperature is large and choosing suitable non-uniform couplings, and our theorem implies the existence of a stationary measure which looks nothing like a low-temperature Gibbs measure. The interesting aspect of our results lies in the fact that the analogous processes do not have non-Gibbsian stationary measures on $\mathbb Z^d$, owing to the amenability of that graph. In fact, no example of a stochastic Ising model with a non-reversible stationary state was known to date.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Dualities and Asymptotics of Dynamic Stochastic Higher Spin Vertex Models, using the Drinfeld Twister</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new, algebraic method to construct duality functions for integrable dynamic models. This method will be implemented on dynamic stochastic higher spin vertex models, where we prove the duality functions are the $ _3 \varphi_2$ functions. A degeneration of these duality functions are orthogonal polynomial dualities of Groenevelt--Wagener arXiv:2306.12318. The method involves using the universal twister of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, viewed as a quasi--triangular, quasi--$^*$--Hopf algebra. The algebraic method is presented very generally and is expected to produce duality functions for other dynamic integrable models. As an application of the duality, we prove that the asymptotic fluctuations of the dynamic stochastic six vertex model with step initial conditions are governed by the Tracy--Widom distribution.</description>

      <title>Gaussian deconvolution and the lace expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give conditions on a real-valued function $F$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d&gt;2$, which ensure that the solution $G$ to the convolution equation $(F*G)(x) = \delta_{0,x}$ has Gaussian decay $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ for large $|x|$. Precursors of our results were obtained in the 2000s, using intricate Fourier analysis. In 2022, a very simple deconvolution theorem was proved, but its applicability was limited. We extend the 2022 theorem to remove its limitations while maintaining its simplicity -- our main tools are H\"older's inequality and basic Fourier theory in $L^p$ space. Our motivation comes from critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics, where the convolution equation is provided by the lace expansion and the deconvolution $G$ is a critical two-point function. Our results significantly simplify existing proofs of critical $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay in high dimensions for self-avoiding walk, Ising and $\varphi^4$ models, percolation, and lattice trees and lattice animals. We also improve previous error estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proof of $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ decay of critical two-point functions for spread-out statistical mechanical models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ above the upper critical dimension, based on the lace expansion and assuming appropriate diagrammatic estimates. Applications include spread-out models of the Ising model and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d&gt;4$, and spread-out percolation for $d&gt;6$. The proof is based on an extension of the new Gaussian deconvolution theorem we obtained in a recent paper. It provides a technically simpler and conceptually more transparent approach than the method of Hara, van der Hofstad and Slade (2003).</description>

      <title>Invisibility of the integers for the discrete Gaussian chain via a Caffarelli-Silvestre extension of the discrete fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Discrete Gaussian Chain is a model of interfaces $\Psi : \mathbf{Z} \to \mathbf{Z}$ governed by the Hamiltonian $$ H(\Psi)= \sum_{i\neq j} J_\alpha(|i-j|) |\Psi_i -\Psi_j|^2 $$ with long-range coupling constants $J_\alpha(k)\asymp k^{-\alpha}$. For any $\alpha\in [2,3)$ and at high enough temperature, we prove an invariance principle for such an $\alpha$-Discrete Gaussian Chain towards a $H(\alpha)$-fractional Gaussian process where the Hurst index $H$ satisfies $H=H(\alpha)=\frac {\alpha-2} 2$. This result goes beyond a conjecture by Fr\"ohlich and Zegarlinski [FZ91] which conjectured fluctuations of order $n^{\tfrac 1 2 (\alpha-2) \wedge 1}$ for the Discrete Gaussian Chain.
  More surprisingly, as opposed to the case of the $2D$ Discrete Gaussian $\Psi : \mathbf{Z}^2 \to \mathbf{Z}$, we prove that the integers do not affect the {\em effective temperature} of the discrete Gaussian Chain at large scales. Such an {\em invisibility of the integers} had been predicted by Slurink and Hilhorst in the special case $\alpha_c=2$ in [SH83]. We also identify a similar invisibility of integers when a $2D$ Gaussian Free Field at high temperature is conditioned to take integer values on a dilute enough "fractal subset" of $\mathbf{Z}^2$.
  Our proof relies on four main ingredients:
  (1) A Caffareli-Silvestre extension for the discrete fractional Laplacian (which may be of independent interest)
  (2) A localisation of the chain in a smoother sub-domain
  (3) A Coulomb gas-type expansion in the spirit of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer [FS82]
  (4) Controlling the amount of Dirichlet Energy supported by a $1D$ band for the Green functions of $\mathbf{Z}^2$ Bessel-type random walks
  Finally, we also analyse the (easier) regime $\alpha\in(1,2) \cup (3,\infty)$ as well as the $2D$ Discrete Gaussian with long-range coupling constants (for any $\alpha&gt;\alpha_c=4$).</description>

      <title>A flow approach to the generalized KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the flow approach of Duch [Duc21] can be adapted to prove local well-posedness for the generalised KPZ equation. The key step is to extend the flow approach so that it can accommodate semilinear equations involving smooth functions of the solution instead of only polynomials - this is accomplished by introducing coordinates for the flow built out of the elementary differentials associated to the equation.</description>

      <title>Random L\'evy Looptrees and L\'evy Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the analogue of L\'evy processes for random surfaces? Motivated by scaling limits of random planar maps in random geometry, we introduce and study L\'evy looptrees and L\'evy maps. They are defined using excursions of general L\'evy processes with no negative jump and extend the known stable looptrees and stable maps, associated with stable processes. We compute in particular their fractal dimensions in terms of the upper and lower Blumenthal-Getoor exponents of the coding L\'evy process. In a second part, we consider excursions of stable processes with a drift and prove that the corresponding looptrees interpolate continuously as the drift varies from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, or as the self-similarity index varies from $1$ to $2$, between a circle and the Brownian tree, whereas the corresponding maps interpolate between the Brownian tree and the Brownian sphere.</description>

      <title>Dynamical behavior and optimal control of a stochastic SAIRS epidemic model with two saturated incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic models are widely used to investigate the spread of epidemics in a complex environment. This paper extends a deterministic SAIRS epidemic model to a stochastic case with limited patient capacity and exposure. We first study the dynamical properties of the model under certain conditions, including persistence, extinction, and ergodic. Then, we introduce vaccination and isolation into the model as control variables. The optimal control strategies are obtained based on the Pontryagin minimum principle. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we consider optimal control problems of stochastic differential equations with delays in the state and in the control. First, we prove an equivalent Markovian reformulation on Hilbert spaces of the state equation. Then, using the dynamic programming approach for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We apply these results to problems coming from economics: stochastic optimal advertising problems and stochastic optimal investment problems with time-to-build.</description>

      <title>The Measure Preserving Martingale Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the recent studies of the so-called Bass martingale. Backhoff-Veraguas et al. (2020) showed it is the solution to the martingale Benamou-Brenier (mBB) problem, i.e., among all martingales with prescribed initial and terminal distributions it is the one closest to the Brownian motion. We link it with semimartingale optimal transport and deduce an alternative way to derive the dual formulation recently obtained in Backhoff-Veraguas et al. (2023). We then consider computational methods to compute the Bass martingale. The dual formulation of the transport problem leads to an iterative scheme that mirrors to the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm for entropic optimal transport. We call it the measure preserving martingale Sinkhorn (MPMS) algorithm. We prove that in any dimension, each step of the algorithm improves the value of the dual problem, which implies its convergence. Our MPMS algorithm is equivalent to the fixed-point method of Conze and Henry-Labordere (2021), studied in Acciaio et al. (2023), and performs very well on a range of examples, including real market data.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence in relative entropy for a moderately interacting particle system on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows how to combine the relative entropy method by D. Bresch, P.-E. Jabin, and Z. Wang in arXiv:1706.09564, arXiv:1906.04093 and the regularized $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$-estimate by Oelschl\"ager (Probability theory and related fields, 1987) to prove a strong propagation of chaos result for the viscous porous medium equation from a moderately interacting particle system in $L^\infty(0,T; L^1(\mathbb{R}^d))$-norm. In the moderate interacting setting, the interacting potential is a smoothed Dirac Delta distribution, however, current results regarding the relative entropy methods for singular potentials do not apply. The result holds on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any dimension $d\geq 1$ and provides a quantitative result where the rate of convergence depends on the moderate scaling parameter and the dimension $d\geq 1$. Additionally, the presented method can be adapted for moderately interacting systems for which a certain convergence probability holds -- thus a propagation of chaos result in relative entropy can be obtained for kernels approximating Coulomb potentials.</description>
