      <title>The Influence of Passing Field Stars on the Solar System's Dynamical Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term dynamical future of the Sun's planets has been simulated and statistically analyzed in great detail, but most prior work considers the solar system as completely isolated, neglecting the potential influence of field star passages. To understand the dynamical significance of field star encounters, we simulate several thousand realizations of the modern solar system in the presence of passing field stars for 5 Gyrs. We find that the impulse gradient of the strongest stellar encounter largely determines the net dynamical effect of field stars. Because the expected strength of such an encounter is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude, the possible significance of field stars can be large. Our simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system can underestimate the degree of our giant planets' future secular orbital changes by over an order of magnitude. In addition, our planets and Pluto are significantly less stable than previously thought. Field stars transform Pluto from a completely stable object over 5 Gyrs to one with a ~5% instability probability. Furthermore, field stars increase the odds of Mercury's instability by ~50-80%. We also find a ~0.3% chance that Mars will be lost through collision or ejection and a ~0.2% probability that Earth will be involved in a planetary collision or ejected. Compared to previously studied instabilities in isolated solar systems models, those induced by field stars are much more likely to involve the loss of multiple planets. In addition, they typically happen sooner in our solar system's future, making field star passages the most likely cause of instability for the next 4-4.5 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Activity in the Largest Known Oort Cloud Comet: ALMA Imaging of C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) at 16.6 au from the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of comet C/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) carried out on UT 2024 March 8 and 17 at a heliocentric distance ($r_{\mathrm{H}}$) of 16.6 au using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The CO ($J$=2-1) line at 230 GHz was detected along with continuum emission from its dust coma and large ($\sim$140 km) nucleus, revealing the nature of the activity drivers and outgassing kinematics of the largest Oort cloud comet discovered to date. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for CO and a stringent upper limit for the H$_2$CO production rate. CO outgassing displays multiple active jets which evolve from one epoch to the next. The continuum emission is compact and spatially unresolved, and is consistent with thermal emission from the large nucleus and a tentative detection of a dust coma. Complementary optical observations provided activity context for the ALMA epochs, indicating that UN271 underwent an outburst in late February before returning to a quiescent brightness in mid--late March. These results represent the first secure detection of molecular activity reported in the literature for C/2014 UN271 and highlight the dynamic nature of this distantly active small world.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c: A Cold Super-Jupiter with a Saturn Sibling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet system, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting high-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known ''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a super-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \simeq 5\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the Close topology, with a normalized separation of $s\simeq 0.70$, is clearly preferred by $\Delta\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet microlensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is substantially (factor of $\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies of the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due to high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy indicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A Bayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the Galactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like orbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a Mercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.</description>

      <title>No Planet around the K Giant Star 42 Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Published radial velocity (RV) measurements of the K giant star 42 Dra reveal variations consistent with a 3.9 M_Jup mass companion in a 479-d orbit. This exoplanet can be confirmed if these variations are long-lived and coherent. Continued monitoring may also reveal other companions. We have acquired additional RV measurements of 42 Dra spanning fifteen years. Periodogram analyses were used to investigate the stability of the planet RV signal. We also investigated variations in the spectral line shapes using the bisector velocity span as well as infrared photometry from the COBE mission. The new RV measurements do not follow the published planet orbit. An orbital solution using the 2004 - 2011 data yields a period and eccentricity consistent with the published values, but the RV amplitude has decreased by a factor of four from the earlier measurements. Including some additional RV measurements taken between 2014 and 2018 reveal the presence of a second period at 530 d. The beating of this period with the one at 479-d may account for the observed amplitude variations. The planet hypothesis is conclusively ruled out by COBE/DIRBE 1.25 micron photometry that shows variations with the planet orbital period as well as an additional 170 d period. The amplitude variations in the RV as well the COBE/DIRBE photometry firmly establish that there is no giant planet around 42 Dra. The presence of multi-periodic variations suggests that these may be stellar oscillations, most likely oscillatory convection modes. These oscillations may account for some of the long period RV variations attributed to planets around K giant stars. This may skew the statistics of planet occurrence around intermediate mass stars. Long-term monitoring with excellent sampling is required to exclude amplitude variations in the long-periods found in radial velocity of K giant stars.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>

      <title>ORBIT-2: Scaling Exascale Vision Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and 92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98 to 0.99 against observation data.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Jet-Bubble-Disk Interaction: Jet Feedback on a Protoplanetary Disk via an Expanding Bubble in WSB 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While stellar jets and outflows are fueled by accretion from disks, their direct influence on disks remain unexplored. Here we revisit ALMA observations of $^{12}\mathrm{CO}\,(J=2-1)$ line emission for the young stellar object WSB 52. We identify an expanding bubble that interacts with its protoplanetary disk. Given that the disk axis points toward the bubble center and the kinetic energy of the bubble is roughly $10^{41}$ erg, we postulate that stellar jets, aligned with the disk axis, have triggered the bubble. The bubble morphology is consistent with uniform expansion with partial concavity, implying the bubble-disk interaction. Correspondingly, the shape and the velocity field of protoplanetary disk appear to be deformed and exhibit high-velocity components, suggesting strong interactions and mass loss from the disk. The discovery of jet feedback onto the disk via the bubble -- which we term the jet-bubble-disk interaction -- sheds new light on the dynamical processes governing star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>HST Transmission Spectra of the Hot-Neptune HD 219666 b: Detection of Water and the Challenge of Constraining Both Water and Methane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Neptunian-sized (2 - 5 R$_{Earth}$) planets appear to be extremely common in the Galaxy, many mysteries remain about their overall nature. To date, only 11 Neptunian-sized planets have had their atmospheres spectroscopically characterized, and these observations hint at interesting diversity within this class of planets. Much of our understanding of these worlds and others derive from transmission spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). One key outcome of HST/WFC3 observations has been the consistent detection of water but no methane in Neptunian atmospheres, though recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations are potentially starting to overturn this "missing methane" paradigm. In this work, we present the transmission spectrum of the hot Neptune HD 219666 b from 1.1 - 1.6 $\mu$m from two transit observations using HST/WFC3 G141. Our fiducial atmospheric retrieval detects water at ~3-$\sigma$ in HD 219666 b's atmosphere and prefers no contribution from methane, similar to these previous observations of other planets. Motivated by recent detections of methane in Neptunian atmospheres by JWST, we explore additional models and find that a methane-only scenario could adequately fit the data, though it is not preferred and likely unphysical. We discuss the impact of this methane detection challenge on our understanding of planetary atmospheres based on HST/WFC3 observations alone, and where JWST observations offer a solution.</description>
