      <title>Bayesian identification of fibrous insulation thermal conductivity towards design of spacecraft thermal protection systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of spacecraft thermal protection systems (TPS) requires accurate knowledge of thermal transport properties across wide ranges of temperature and pressure. For fibrous insulation, conventional measurement techniques in laboratory settings are typically limited to temperatures much lower than what is reached in atmosphere entry scenarios. Moreover, it is often the case that only temperature measurements are available, meaning that the thermal conductivity of the insulation must be indirectly inferred as an inverse problem. We propose a Bayesian framework using information field theory (IFT) to reconstruct the thermal conductivity of high-temperature fibrous insulation from sparse experimental data. Under IFT, the conductivity is represented as a Gaussian process, and the physics is enforced via a physics-informed prior over the temperature derived from the heat equation. Bayes's rule produces an infinite-dimensional posterior distribution that quantifies uncertainty about the conductivity which can be evaluated in extrapolation regimes. We apply the method to Opacified Fibrous Insulation with both synthetic and experimental data to reconstruct the thermal conductivity beyond the experimental regime. The inferred conductivities are validated against reference data and then propagated into high-fidelity digital twins of flexible TPS performance under Mars and Earth entry trajectories. The results show that IFT yields accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty, enabling robust TPS sizing in regimes inaccessible to direct measurement.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Interatomic Potentials without Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials have emerged as powerful tools for atomistic simulations, promising near first-principles accuracy across diverse chemical spaces at a fraction of the cost of quantum-mechanical calculations. However, the most accurate equivariant architectures rely on Clebsch-Gordan tensor products whose computational cost scales steeply with angular resolution, creating a trade-off between model expressiveness and inference speed that ultimately limits practical applications. Here we introduce Geodite, an equivariant message-passing architecture that replaces tensor products while incorporating physical priors to ensure smooth, well-behaved potential energy surfaces. Trained on the Materials Project trajectories dataset of inorganic crystals, Geodite-MP achieves accuracy competitive with leading methods on benchmarks for materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity, phonon-derived properties, and nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics, while running $3\text{--}5\times$ faster than models performing similarly. By combining predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and physicality, Geodite enables faster large-scale atomistic simulations and high-throughput screening that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Convolutional LSTM Surrogate for Mesoscale Hydrocode Simulations of Granular Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials subjected to impact loading exhibit highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal dynamics governed by wave propagation, pore collapse, and grain-scale rearrangements. Mesoscale hydrocodes resolve these processes but are computationally expensive, limiting their use in parametric studies and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we develop a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) neural network as a spatiotemporal surrogate for mesoscale simulations of weak shock propagation in granular media. Using two-dimensional hydrocode simulations as training data, we first consider a simplified "billiard break" problem in which a cue ball impacts a cluster of nine circular balls, all deformable. Sequences of pressure-field images serve as input-output pairs for a sequence-to-sequence ConvLSTM, which is trained to predict future frames from a short history. We compare several architectures and show that a relatively compact encoder-decoder ConvLSTM accurately reproduces the propagation of the pressure wave and the resulting particle motion for an unseen combination of cue-ball position and impact velocity. As a proof-of-concept extension, we apply the same ConvLSTM framework to previously published mesoscale simulations of weak shock compaction in a granular ensemble. When evaluated at piston impact speeds that were completely withheld from training, the surrogate captures the position and shape of the compaction front and its dependence on impact speed, while smoothing fine pore-scale details in the highly compacted region as expected. These results demonstrate that ConvLSTM models can serve as satisfactory surrogates for spatiotemporal mesoscale simulations of granular wave propagation, enabling accelerated exploration of parameter space and laying the groundwork for physics-informed, mesoscale simulations of granular materials under shock loading.</description>

      <title>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</description>

      <title>Controlling HER activity and stability of $\gamma$- and 6,6,12-Graphyne through engineered B-N doping: DFT and Reactive MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphynes offer a chemically heterogeneous $sp/sp^{2}$ carbon framework with distinct electronic regimes and site-selective reactivity. Here, Density Functional Theory and Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations are combined to evaluate pristine, B-doped, N-doped, and B-N co-doped $\gamma$-graphyne and 6,6,12-graphyne (meta/ortho/para). $\gamma$-graphyne is a semiconductor, while 6,6,12-graphyne exhibits an anisotropic Dirac-like semi-metallic dispersion. B/N substitution reconstructs near-$E_F$ states via dopant $\pi$ hybridization, and B-N pairing stabilizes defects through donor-acceptor compensation, with the ortho substitutions being the most favorable. Hydrogen adsorption remains weak on pristine lattices but becomes locally optimized upon doping, with near thermo-neutral $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ 'hot spots' predominantly on $sp$-proximate carbon sites adjacent to the dopants. Reactive MD at 300 K further reveals an activity stability trade-off: B-N ortho in $\gamma$-graphyne sustains controlled hydrogen uptake without catastrophic bond scission, whereas B-N meta/para degrade, and 6,6,12-graphyne is generally more susceptible to over-hydrogenation. These results identify the B-N geometry as a key design variable for graphyne-based HER catalysts, which require both a favorable $\Delta G_{\mathrm{ads}}$ and finite-temperature hydrogenation stability.</description>

      <title>Numba-Accelerated 2D Diffusion-Limited Aggregation: Implementation and Fractal Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present dla-ideal-solver, a high-performance framework for simulating two-dimensional Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) using Numba-accelerated Python. By leveraging just-in-time (JIT) compilation, we achieve computational throughput comparable to legacy static implementations while retaining high-level flexibility. We investigate the Laplacian growth instability across varying injection geometries and walker concentrations. Our analysis confirms the robustness of the standard fractal dimension $D_f \approx 1.71$ for dilute regimes, consistent with the Witten-Sander universality class. However, we report a distinct crossover to Eden-like compact growth ($D_f \approx 1.87$) in high-density environments, attributed to the saturation of the screening length. Beyond standard mass-radius scaling, we employ generalized R\'{e}nyi dimensions and lacunarity metrics to quantify the monofractal character and spatial heterogeneity of the aggregates. This work establishes a reproducible, open-source testbed for exploring phase transitions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Study of the Effects of Artificial Dissipation and Other Numerical Parameters on Shock Wave Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects induced by numerical schemes and mesh geometry on the solution of two-dimensional supersonic inviscid flows are investigated in the context of the compressible Euler equations. Five different finite-difference schemes are considered: the Beam and Warming implicit approximate factorization algorithm, the original Steger and Warming flux vector splitting algorithm, the van Leer approach on performing the flux vector splitting and two different novel finite-difference interpretations of the Liou AUSM+ scheme. Special focus is given to the shock wave resolution capabilities of each scheme for the solution of an external supersonic inviscid flows around a blunt body. Significant changes in the shock structure are observed, mainly due to special properties of the scheme in use and the influence of the domain transformation procedure. Perturbations in the supersonic flow upstream of the shock are also seen in the solution, which is a non-physical behavior. Freestream subtraction, flux limiting and the explicit addition of artificial dissipation are employed in order to circumvent these problems. One of the AUSM+ formulations presented here is seen to be particularly more robust in avoiding the appearance of some of these numerically-induced disturbances and non-physical characteristics in the solution. Good agreement is achieved with both numerical and experimental results available in the literature.}</description>

      <title>Numerical Aspects of Gradient Reconstruction Schemes Applied to Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work primarily focuses on the study of three gradient reconstruction techniques applied to the calculation of viscous terms in a cell-centered, finite volume formulation for general unstructured grids. The work also addresses different ways of formulating the limiter functions necessary to maintain stability in the presence of flow discontinuities. The flows of interest are simulated using the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the negative Spalart-Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. Definition of interface inviscid terms uses the Roe approximate Riemann solver, whereas the interface viscous terms are calculated with a standard centered scheme together with appropriate definitions of the interface gradients. Steady state solutions are obtained using an implicit time-integration method, together with a novel convergence acceleration technique. This new approach defines a set of three simple rules for controlling the global CFL number based on the residue evolution. The work considers three test cases, namely, the subsonic bump-in-channel flow, the subsonic NASA high-lift Common Research Model multielement airfoil and the transonic ONERA M6 wing. Present results are compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature. Severe numerical instabilities are observed when the simplest gradient reconstruction technique is used, while more sophisticated formulations are able to provide excellent agreement with the existing literature. Current results are demonstrated to be highly insensitive to modifications made to the numerical flux entropy fix terms. Integrated aerodynamic forces are shown to be mildly dependent on the limiter formulation used, even in the absence of shock waves. The proposed convergence acceleration procedure manages to quickly drive the residue terms to machine zero, provided no major instabilities are present.</description>

      <title>Fast recovery of parametric eigenvalues depending on several parameters and location of high order exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm is proposed to deal with parametric eigenvalue problems involving non-Hermitian matrices and is exploited to find location of defective eigenvalues in the parameter space of non-Hermitian parametric eigenvalue problems. These non-Hermitian degeneracies also called exceptional points (EP) have raised considerable attention in the scientific community as these can have a great impact in a variety of physical problems. The method first requires the computation of high order derivatives of a few selected eigenvalues with respect to each parameter involved. The second step is to recombine these quantities to form new coefficients associated with a partial characteristic polynomial (PCP). By construction, these coefficients are regular functions in a large domain of the parameter space which means that the PCP allows one to recover the selected eigenvalues as well as the localization of high order EPs by simply using standard root-finding algorithms. The versatility of the proposed approach is tested on several applications, from mass-spring systems to guided acoustic waves with absorbing walls and room acoustics. The scalability of the method to large sparse matrices arising from conventional discretization techniques such as the finite element method is demonstrated. The proposed approach can be extended to a large number of applications where EPs play an important role in quantum mechanics, optics and photonics or in mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>Implicit and explicit treatments of model error in numerical simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of physical systems exhibit discrepancies arising from unmodeled physics and idealizations, as well as numerical approximation errors stemming from discretization and solver tolerances. This article reviews techniques developed in the past several decades to approximate and account for model errors, both implicitly and explicitly. Beginning from fundamentals, we frame model error in inverse problems, data assimilation, and predictive modeling contexts. We then survey major approaches: the Bayesian approximation error framework, embedded internal error models for structural uncertainty, probabilistic numerical methods for discretization uncertainty, model discrepancy modeling in Bayesian calibration and its recent extensions, machine-learning-based discrepancy correction, multi-fidelity and hybrid modeling strategies, as well as residual-based, variational, and adjoint-driven error estimators. Throughout, we emphasize the conceptual underpinnings of implicit versus explicit error treatment and highlight how these methods improve predictive performance and uncertainty quantification in practical applications ranging from engineering design to Earth-system science. Each section provides an overview of key developments with an extensive list of references to facilitate further reading. The review is written for practitioners of large-scale computational physics and engineering simulation, emphasizing how these methods can be incorporated into PDE solvers, inverse problem workflows, and data assimilation systems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison between Separately Calibrated P-{\alpha} and Mesoscale Models for Weak Shock Compaction of Granular Sugar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study compares calibration strategies for predicting particle velocity in granular sugar subjected to weak shock loading, using measurements from flyer-plate impact experiments as a benchmark. Two computational approaches are evaluated: a continuum-based P-alpha Menikoff model requiring calibration of effective constitutive parameters, and mesoscale simulations that explicitly resolve grain geometry and porosity. Both models can match the measured particle-velocity histories, but only through fundamentally different calibration mechanisms. In the P-alpha model, a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential and the response remains highly sensitive to parameter choices such as the crush-out pressure. In contrast, mesoscale simulations are far less sensitive to parameter tuning and instead depend primarily on the physical state variable of porosity, represented in 2D through an equivalent mapping of the 3D specimen. These results show that continuum parameters act as effective surrogates for underlying grain-scale processes, whereas mesoscale modeling identifies porosity as the dominant control on macroscopic wave onset, highlighting distinct calibration pathways and interpretive implications for each modeling approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multiphase modeling of anisotropic biomass particle pyrolysis accounting for particle deformation and coupled gas-phase dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical models of biomass particle pyrolysis focus on either the solid particle evolution or on the surrounding gas-phase dynamics, neglecting the coupled interactions between the two. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a single-grid model that fully resolves both phases without relying on sub-grid-scale correlations. The model adopts an Eulerian representation of the two-phase system, using a Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method to track the interface between the biomass and the surrounding gas phase. Solid-phase pyrolysis reactions are included, and a novel approach is proposed to capture the coupling between the evolution of biomass porosity and the particle shrinkage, combining different biomass conversion models into one unique framework. The anisotropic nature of the biomass particle is accounted for in this multidimensional framework. The resulting model is independent of the number and shape of the particle, and demonstrates mass conservation and numerical convergence. Extensive validation with experimental data, collected from wood particles in the centimetre scale and operating temperature between 400-700{\deg}C, shows excellent agreement in terms of mass and temperature profiles and correct volatiles trends. Predicted char yields fall within 2% error range. Shrinking profiles reveal correct trends, with a 10% average error in the final particle shape, but they also highlight the need for a better fundamental understanding of the evolution of the biomass structure. Overall, the model takes a step forward in aiding the development of sustainable pyrolysis processes. The code and simulation setups, developed within the open-source Basilisk framework, are made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the CI-NEB with the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench benchmark set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction in energy and force calculations of 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. These results establish this hybrid method as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>
