      <title>Antirealism in sheep's clothing: Wave function realism and scientific realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific realism is the philosophical stance that science tracks truth, in particular in its depiction of the world's ontology. Ontologically, this involves a commitment to the existence of entities posited by our best scientific theories; metaontologically, it includes the claim that the theoretical framework itself is true. In this article, we examine wave function realism as a case study within this broader methodological debate. Wave function realism holds that the wave function, as described by quantum mechanics, corresponds to a real physical entity. We focus on a recent formulation of this view that commits to the ontology of the wave function while deliberately avoiding the metaontological question of the framework's truth. Instead, the view is defended on pragmatic, non-truth-conductive grounds. This, we argue, raises tensions for the purported realism of wave function realism and its compatibility with scientific realism more broadly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Systems as Indivisible Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the stochastic-quantum correspondence, a quantum system can be understood as a stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space based on ordinary notions of probability and `indivisible' stochastic laws, which are a non-Markovian generalization of the laws that describe a textbook stochastic process. The Hilbert spaces of quantum theory and their ingredients, including wave functions, can then be relegated to secondary roles as convenient mathematical appurtenances. In addition to providing an arguably more transparent way to understand and modify quantum theory, this indivisible-stochastic formulation may lead to new possible applications of the theory. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into the conceptual foundations and structure of the stochastic-quantum correspondence, with a particular focus on novel forms of gauge invariance, dynamical symmetries, and Hilbert-space dilations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Large Physics Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark framework developed by and for the scientific community to evaluate, monitor and steer large language model development in fundamental physics. Building on philosophical concepts of scientific understanding and creativity, we develop a scoring system in which each question is scored by an expert for its correctness, difficulty, and surprise. The questions are of three forms: (i) multiple-choice questions for conceptual understanding, (ii) analytical problems requiring mathematical derivation, and (iii) openended tasks requiring complex problem solving. Our current dataset contains diverse set of examples, including a machine learning challenge to classify high-energy physics events, such as the four top quark signal. To ensure continued relevance, we propose a living benchmark, where physicists contribute questions, for instance alongside new publications. We invite contributions via: http://www.physicsbenchmarks.org/. We hope that this benchmark will enable a targeted AI development that can make a meaningful contribution to fundamental physics research.</description>
