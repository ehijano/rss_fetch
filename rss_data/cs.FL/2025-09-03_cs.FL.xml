      <title>Generalised M\"obius Categories and Convolution Kleene Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolution algebras on maps from structures such as monoids, groups or categories into semirings, rings or fields abound in mathematics and the sciences. Of special interest in computing are convolution algebras based on variants of Kleene algebras, which are additively idempotent semirings equipped with a Kleene star. Yet an obstacle to the construction of convolution Kleene algebras on a wide class of structures has so far been the definition of a suitable star. We show that a generalisation of M\"obius categories combined with a generalisation of a classical definition of a star for formal power series allow such a construction. We discuss several instances of this construction on generalised M\"obius categories: convolution Kleene algebras with tests, modal convolution Kleene algebras, concurrent convolution Kleene algebras and higher convolution Kleene algebras (e.g. on strict higher categories and higher relational monoids). These are relevant to the verification of weighted and probabilistic sequential and concurrent programs, using quantitative Hoare logics or predicate transformer algebras, as well as for algebraic reasoning in higher-dimensional rewriting. We also adapt the convolution Kleene algebra construction to Conway semirings, which is widely studied in the context of weighted automata. Finally, we compare the convolution Kleene algebra construction with a previous construction of convolution quantales and present concrete example structures in preparation for future applications.</description>

      <title>Computational Exploration of Finite Semigroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent algorithmic advances in algebraic automata theory drew attention to semigroupoids (semicategories). These are mathematical descriptions of typed computational processes, but they have not been studied systematically in the context of automata. Here, we use relational programming to explore finite semigroupoids to improve our mathematical intuition about these models of computation. We implement declarative solutions for enumerating abstract semigroupoids (partial composition tables), finding homomorphisms, and constructing (minimal) transformation representations. We show that associativity and consistent typing are different properties, distinguish between strict and more permissive homomorphisms, and systematically enumerate arrow-type semigroupoids (reified type structures).</description>

      <title>A substitution lemma for multiple context-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new criterion for proving that a language is not multiple context-free, which we call a Substitution Lemma. We apply it to show a sample selection of languages are not multiple context-free, including the word problem of $F_2\times F_2$.
  Our result is in contrast to Kanazawa et al. [2014, Theory Comput. Syst.] who proved that it was not possible to generalise the standard pumping lemma for context-free languages to multiple context-free languages, and Kanazawa [2019, Inform. and Comput.] who showed a weak variant of generalised Ogden's lemma does not apply to multiple context-free languages.
  We also show that groups with multiple context-free word problem have rational subset membership and intersection problems.</description>

      <title>DTMC Model Checking by Path Abstraction Revisited (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the probability of reaching a set of goal states G in a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) is a core task of probabilistic model checking. We can do so by directly computing the probability mass of the set of all finite paths from the initial state to G; however, when refining counterexamples, it is also interesting to compute the probability mass of subsets of paths. This can be achieved by splitting the computation into path abstractions that calculate "local" reachability probabilities as shown by \'Abrah\'am et al. in 2010. In this paper, we complete and extend their work: We prove that splitting the computation into path abstractions indeed yields the same result as the direct approach, and that the splitting does not need to follow the SCC structure. In particular, we prove that path abstraction can be performed along any finite sequence of sets of non-goal states. Our proofs proceed in a novel way by interpreting the DTMC as a structure on the free monoid on its state space, which makes them clean and concise. Additionally, we provide a compact reference implementation of path abstraction in PARI/GP.</description>

      <title>Mean-payoff and Energy Discrete Bidding Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A \emph{bidding} game is played on a graph as follows. A token is placed on an initial vertex and both players are allocated budgets. In each turn, the players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed their available budgets, the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to the lower bidder. We focus on \emph{discrete}-bidding, which are motivated by practical applications and restrict the granularity of the players' bids, e.g, bids must be given in cents. We study, for the first time, discrete-bidding games with {\em mean-payoff} and {\em energy} objectives. In contrast, mean-payoff {\em continuous}-bidding games (i.e., no granularity restrictions) are understood and exhibit a rich mathematical structure. The {\em threshold} budget is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning an energy game or guaranteeing a target payoff in a mean-payoff game. We first establish existence of threshold budgets; a non-trivial property due to the concurrent moves of the players. Moreover, we identify the structure of the thresholds, which is key in obtaining compact strategies, and in turn, showing that finding threshold is in \NP~and \coNP even in succinctly-represented games.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training. We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.</description>

      <title>Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.</description>

      <title>Decision Procedure for A Theory of String Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of sequences, supported by many SMT solvers, can model program data types including bounded arrays and lists. Sequences are parameterized by the element data type and provide operations such as accessing elements, concatenation, forming sub-sequences and updating elements. Strings and sequences are intimately related; many operations, e.g., matching a string according to a regular expression, splitting strings, or joining strings in a sequence, are frequently used in string-manipulating programs. Nevertheless, these operations are typically not directly supported by existing SMT solvers, which instead only consider the generic theory of sequences. In this paper, we propose a theory of string sequences and study its satisfiability. We show that, while it is undecidable in general, the decidability can be recovered by restricting to the straight-line fragment. This is shown by encoding each string sequence as a string, and each string sequence operation as a corresponding string operation. We provide pre-image computation for the resulting string operations with respect to automata, effectively casting it into the generic OSTRICH string constraint solving framework. We implement the new decision procedure as a tool $\ostrichseq$, and carry out experiments on benchmark constraints generated from real-world JavaScript programs, hand-crafted templates and unit tests. The experiments confirm the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Complexity of the Existence of Constrained Secure Equilibria in Multi-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-player non-zero-sum turn-based game (abbreviated as multi-player game) on a finite directed graph. A secure equilibrium (SE) is a strategy profile in which no player has the incentive to deviate from the strategy because no player can increase her own payoff or lower the payoff of another player. SE is a promising refinement of Nash equilibrium in which a player does not care the payoff of another player. In this paper, we discuss the decidability and complexity of the problem of deciding whether a secure equilibrium with constraints (a payoff profile specifying which players must win) exists for a given multi-player game.</description>

      <title>RNN Generalization to Omega-Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from 3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target $\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Task Planning for Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the automatic task planning problem for multi-agent systems. A formal framework is developed based on the Nondeterministic Finite Automata with $\epsilon$-transitions, where given the capabilities, constraints and failure modes of the agents involved, an initial state of the system and a task specification, an optimal solution is generated that satisfies the system constraints and the task specification. The resulting solution is guaranteed to be complete and optimal; moreover a heuristic solution that offers significant reduction of the computational requirements while relaxing the completeness and optimality requirements is proposed. The constructed system model is independent from the initial condition and the task specification, alleviating the need to repeat the costly pre-processing cycle for solving other scenarios, while allowing the incorporation of failure modes on-the-fly. Two case studies are provided: a simple one to showcase the concepts of the proposed methodology and a more elaborate one to demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of the methodology.</description>

      <title>Tool-Assisted Conformance Checking to Reference Process Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reference models convey best practices and standards. The reference frameworks necessitate conformance checks to ensure adherence to established guidelines and principles, which is crucial for maintaining quality and consistency in various processes. This paper explores automated conformance checks for concrete process models against reference models using causal dependency analysis of tasks and events. Existing notions of conformance checking for process models focus on verifying process execution traces and lack the expressiveness and automation needed for semantic model comparison, leaving this question unresolved. We integrate our approach into a broader semantic framework for defining reference model conformance. We outline an algorithm for reference process model conformance checking, evaluate it through a case study, and discuss its strengths and limitations. Our research provides a tool-assisted solution enhancing accuracy and flexibility in process model conformance verification.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Symbolic Execution for Semantic Difference Analysis of Component and Connector Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of model-driven development, ensuring the correctness and consistency of evolving models is paramount. This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</description>
