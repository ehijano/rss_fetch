      <title>Chain rule symmetry for singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the chain rule symmetry for the geometric stochastic heat equations in the full subcritical regime for Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. We show that the renormalised counter-terms that give a solution invariant under changes of coordinates are generated by iterations of covariant derivatives. The result was known only for space-time white noises, with a very specific proof that so far could not be extended to the general case. The key idea of the present paper is to change the perspective on several levels and to use ideas coming from operad theory and homological algebra. Concretely, we introduce the operad of Christoffel trees that captures the counter-terms of the renormalised equation; our main new insight is to describe the space of invariant terms homologically, using a suitable perturbation of the differential of the operadic twisting of that operad. As a consequence, we obtain the correct renormalisation for the quasi-linear KPZ equation in the subcritical regime completing the programme started by Hairer and Gerencser. Previously, the main algebraic tool used in the study of singular SPDEs were Hopf algebras of decorated trees; our work shows that operad theory and homological algebra add new powerful tools with immediate applications to open problems that were out of reach by other methods.</description>

      <title>Sharp total variation rates of convergence for fluctuations of linear statistics of $\beta$-ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit the question of fluctuations of linear statistics of beta ensembles in the single cut and non-critical regime for general potentials $V$ under mild regularity and growth assumptions. Our main objective is to establish sharp quantitative Central Limit Theorems (CLT) for strong distances, such as the total variation distance, which to the best of our knowledge, is new for general potentials, even qualitatively. Namely, setting $\mu_V$ the equilibrium measure, for a test function $\xi \in \mathscr{C}^{14}$, we establish the convergence in total variation of $X_n=\sum_{i=1}^n \xi(\lambda_i)-n\langle \xi,\mu_V\rangle$ to an explicit Gaussian variable at the sharp speed $1/n$. Under the same assumptions, we also establish multivariate CLTs for vectors of linear statistics in $p-$Wasserstein distances for any $p\ge 1$, with the optimal rate $1/n$, a result which already in dimension one sharpens the speed of convergence established in the recent contribution [26] as well as the required regularity on the test functions. A second objective of this paper, in a more qualitative direction, is to establish the so-called super-convergence of linear statistics, that is to say the convergence of all derivatives of the densities of $X_n$ uniformly on $\mathbb{R}$, provided that $\xi\in\mathscr{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ and is not too degenerated in some sense.</description>

      <title>The Brenier-Schr\"odinger problem with respect to Feller semimartingales and non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem from incompressible fluid mechanics of Brenier (JAMS 1989), and its recent entropic relaxation by Arnaudo, Cruizero, L\'eonard &amp; Zambrini (AIHP PS 2020), we study a problem of entropic minimization on the path space when the reference measure is a generic Feller semimartingale. We show that, under some regularity condition, our problem connects naturally with a, possibly non-local, version of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Additionally, we study existence of minimizers when the reference measure in a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove in a very weak regularity setting existence and uniqueness of quasi-stationary distributions as well as exponential conver- gence towards the quasi-stationary distribution for the generalized Langevin and the Nos{\'e}-Hoover processes, two processes which are widely used in molecular dynamics. The case of singular potentials is considered. With the techniques used in this work, we are also able to greatly improve existing results on quasi-stationary distributions for the kinetic Langevin process to a weak regularity setting.</description>

      <title>Long run convergence of discrete-time interacting particle systems of the McKean-Vlasov type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete time system of n coupled random vectors, a.k.a. interacting particles.  The dynamics involves a vanishing step size, some random centered perturbations,  and a mean vector field which induces the coupling between the particles.  We study the doubly asymptotic regime where both the number of iterations and the number n of particles tend to infinity,  without any constraint on the relative rates of convergence of these two parameters.  We establish that the empirical measure of the interpolated trajectories of the particles converges in probability,  in an ergodic sense, to the set of recurrent Mc-Kean-Vlasov distributions.  A first application example is the granular media equation, where the particles are shown  to converge to a critical point of the Helmholtz energy.  A second  example  is the convergence of stochastic gradient descent   to the global minimizer of the risk, in a wide two-layer neural networks using random features.</description>

      <title>Sojourn functionals of time-dependent $\chi^2$-random fields on two-point homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we investigate geometric properties of invariant spatio-temporal random fields $X:\mathbb M^d\times \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ defined on a compact two-point homogeneous space $\mathbb M^d$ in any dimension $d\ge 2$, and evolving over time. In particular, we focus on chi-squared distributed random fields, and study the large time behavior (as $T\to +\infty$) of the average on $[0,T]$ of the volume of the excursion set on the manifold, i.e., of $\lbrace X(\cdot, t)\ge u\rbrace$ (for any $u &gt;0$). The Fourier components of $X$ may have short or long memory in time, i.e., integrable or non-integrable temporal covariance functions. Our argument follows the approach developed in (Marinucci, Rossi, Vidotto (2021) Ann. Appl. Probab.) and allow to extend their results for invariant spatio-temporal Gaussian fields on the two-dimensional unit sphere to the case of chi-squared distributed fields on two-point homogeneous spaces in any dimension. We find that both the asymptotic variance and limiting distribution, as $T\to +\infty$, of the average empirical volume turn out to be non-universal, depending on the memory parameters of the field $X$.</description>

      <title>Particle approximation for a conditional McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a type of interacting particle systems to approximate a class of stochastic different equations whose coefficients depend on the conditional probability distributions of the processes given partial observations. After proving the well-posedness and regularity of the particle systems, we establish a quantitative convergence result for the empirical measures of the particle systems in the Wasserstein space, as the number of particles increases. Moreover, we discuss an Euler--Maruyama scheme of the particle system and validate its strong convergence. A numerical experiment is conducted to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Functional differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>High order weak approximation of Stochastic Differential Equations for bounded and measurable test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for approximating solutions of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with arbitrary rates. This approximation is derived for bounded and measurable test functions. Specifically, we demonstrate that, leveraging the standard weak approximation properties of numerical schemes for smooth test functions (such as first-order weak convergence for the Euler scheme) we can achieve convergence for simply bounded and measurable test functions at any desired rate by constructing a tailored approximation for the semigroup of the SDE. This is achieved by evaluating the scheme (e.g., Euler) on a random time grid. To establish convergence, we exploit the regularization properties of the scheme, which hold under a weak uniform H\"ormander condition.</description>

      <title>Cover times of the massive random walk loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cover times of subsets of ${\mathbb Z}^2$ by a two-dimensional massive random walk loop soup. We consider a sequence of subsets $A_n \subset {\mathbb Z}^2$ such that $|A_n| \to \infty$ and determine the distributional limit of their cover times ${\mathcal T}(A_n).$ We allow the killing rate $\kappa_n$ (or equivalently the ``mass'') of the loop soup to depend on the size of the set $A_n$ to be covered. In particular, we determine the limiting behavior of the cover times for inverse killing rates all the way up to $\kappa_n^{-1}=|A_n|^{1-8/(\log \log |A_n|)},$ showing that it can be described by a Gumbel distribution. Since a typical loop in this model will have length at most of order $\kappa_n^{-1/2}=|A_n|^{1/2},$ if $\kappa_n^{-1}$ exceeded $|A_n|,$ the cover times of all points in a tightly packed set $A_n$ (i.e. a square or close to a ball) would presumably be heavily correlated, complicating the analysis. Our result comes close to this extreme case.</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of the 2D parabolic Anderson model with exclusion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the (discrete) parabolic Anderson model $\partial u(t,x)/\partial t=\Delta u(t,x) +\xi_t(x) u(t,x)$, $t\geq 0$, $x\in \mathbb{Z}^d$. Here, the $\xi$-field is $\mathbb{R}$-valued, acting as a dynamic random environment, and $\Delta$ represents the discrete Laplacian. We focus on the case where $\xi$ is given by a rescaled symmetric simple exclusion process which converges to an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. By scaling the Laplacian diffusively and considering the equation on a torus, we demonstrate that in dimension $d=2$, when a suitably renormalized version of the above equation is considered, the sequence of solutions converges in law. This resolves an open problem from~\cite{EH23}, where a similar result was shown in the three-dimensional case. The novel contribution in the present work is the establishment of a gradient bound on the transition probability of a fixed but arbitrary number of labelled exclusion particles.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the infinite cluster and the cluster density in the Poisson driven random connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random connection model (RCM) on a general space driven by a Poisson process whose intensity measure is scaled by a parameter $t\ge 0$. We say that the infinite clusters are deletion stable if the removal of a Poisson point cannot split a cluster in two or more infinite clusters. We prove that this stability together with a natural irreducibility assumption implies uniqueness of the infinite cluster. Conversely, if the infinite cluster is unique then this stability property holds. Several criteria for irreducibility will be established. We also study the analytic properties of expectations of functions of clusters as a function of $t$. In particular we show that the position dependent cluster density is differentiable. A significant part of this paper is devoted to the important case of a stationary marked RCM (in Euclidean space), containing the Boolean model with general compact grains and the so-called weighted RCM as special cases. In this case we establish differentiability and a convexity property of the cluster density $\kappa(t)$. These properties are crucial for our proof of deletion stability of the infinite clusters but are also of interest in their own right. It then follows that an irreducible stationary marked RCM can have at most one infinite cluster. This extends and unifies several results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Global asymptotics for $\beta$-Krawtchouk corners processes via multi-level loop equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter family of probability distributions, indexed by $\beta/2 = \theta &gt; 0$ and $K \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, that are called $\beta$-Krawtchouk corners processes. These measures are related to Jack symmetric functions, and can be thought of as integrable discretizations of $\beta$-corners processes from random matrix theory, or alternatively as non-determinantal measures on lozenge tilings of infinite domains. We show that as $K$ tends to infinity the height function of these models concentrates around an explicit limit shape, and prove that its fluctuations are asymptotically described by a pull-back of the Gaussian free field, which agrees with the one for Wigner matrices. The main tools we use to establish our results are certain multi-level loop equations introduced in our earlier work arXiv:2108.07710.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>On the Pettis Integral Approach to Large Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of large population economies with incomplete information often entails the integration of a continuum of random variables. We showcase the usefulness of the integral notion \`a la Pettis (1938) to study such models. We present several results on Pettis integrals, including convenient sufficient conditions for Pettis integrability and Fubini-like exchangeability formulae, illustrated through a running example. Building on these foundations, we conduct a unified analysis of Bayesian games with arbitrarily many heterogeneous agents. We provide a sufficient condition on payoff structures, under which the equilibrium uniqueness is guaranteed across all signal structures. Our condition is parsimonious, as it turns out necessary when strategic interactions are undirected. We further identify the moment restrictions, imposed on the equilibrium action-state joint distribution, which have crucial implications for information designer's problem of persuading a population of strategically interacting agents. To attain these results, we introduce and develop novel mathematical tools, built on the theory of integral kernels and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in functional analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic impulse control problem that is motivated by applications such as the optimal exploitation of a natural resource. In particular, we consider a stochastic system whose uncontrolled state dynamics are modelled by a non-explosive positive linear diffusion. The control that can be applied to this system takes the form of one-sided impulsive action. The objective of the control problem is to maximise a discounted performance criterion that rewards the effect of control action but involves a fixed cost at each time of a control intervention. We derive the complete solution to this problem under general assumptions. It turns out that the solution can take four qualitatively different forms, several of which have not been observed in the literature. In two of the four cases, there exist only $\varepsilon$-optimal control strategies. We also show that the boundary classification of 0 may play a critical role in the solution of the problem. Furthermore, we develop a way for establishing the strong solution to a stochastic impulse control problem's optimally controlled SDE.</description>

      <title>A McKean--Vlasov equation with positive feedback and blow-ups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.07703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a McKean--Vlasov equation arising from a mean-field model of a particle system with positive feedback. As particles hit a barrier they cause the other particles to jump in the direction of the barrier and this feedback mechanism leads to the possibility that the system can exhibit contagious blow-ups. Using a fixed-point argument we construct a differentiable solution up to a first explosion time. Our main contribution is a proof of uniqueness in the class of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions, which confirms the validity of related propagation-of-chaos results in the literature. We extend the allowed initial conditions to include densities with any power law decay at the boundary, and connect the exponent of decay with the growth exponent of the solution in small time in a precise way. This takes us asymptotically close to the control on initial conditions required for a global solution theory. A novel minimality result and trapping technique are introduced to prove uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the k-core of a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very sparse random graphs are known to typically be singular (i.e., have singular adjacency matrix), due to the presence of "low-degree dependencies'' such as isolated vertices and pairs of degree-1 vertices with the same neighbourhood. We prove that these kinds of dependencies are in some sense the only causes of singularity: for constants $k\ge 3$ and $\lambda &gt; 0$, an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph $G\sim\mathbb{G}(n,\lambda/n)$ with $n$ vertices and edge probability $\lambda/n$ typically has the property that its $k$-core (its largest subgraph with minimum degree at least $k$) is nonsingular. This resolves a conjecture of Vu from the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians, and adds to a short list of known nonsingularity theorems for "extremely sparse'' random matrices with density $O(1/n)$. A key aspect of our proof is a technique to extract high-degree vertices and use them to "boost'' the rank, starting from approximate rank bounds obtainable from (non-quantitative) spectral convergence machinery due to Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez.</description>

      <title>On the quasi-ergodicity of absorbing Markov chains with unbounded transition densities, including random logistic maps with escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider absorbing Markov chains $X_n$ admitting a quasi-stationary measure $\mu$ on $M$ where the transition kernel $\mathcal P$ admits an eigenfunction $0\leq \eta\in L^1(M,\mu)$. We find conditions on the transition densities of $\mathcal P$ with respect to $\mu$ which ensure that $\eta(x) \mu(\mathrm d x)$ is a quasi-ergodic measure for $X_n$ and that the Yaglom limit converges to the quasi-stationary measure $\mu$-almost surely. We apply this result to the random logistic map $X_{n+1} = \omega_n X_n (1-X_n)$ absorbed at $\mathbb R \setminus [0,1],$ where $\omega_n$ is an i.i.d sequence of random variables uniformly distributed in $[a,b],$ for $1\leq a &lt;4$ and $b&gt;4.$</description>

      <title>Maxitive monetary risk measures on subsets of $L^0$: worst-case risk assessment and sharp large deviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In risk analysis, worst-case risk assessments are performed using maxitive monetary risk measures. In this article, we investigate maxitive monetary risk measures on subsets of \( L^0 \). We prove that a monetary risk measure is maxitive and continuous from below if and only if it is a penalized worst-case risk measure. We characterize the usual worst-case risk measure as the unique maxitive and law-invariant monetary risk measure. We apply the results to large deviation theory by providing a general criterion to establish a sharp large deviation estimate of a sequence of probability measures. Additionally, we prove new limit results for sequences of distorted expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies Gaussian random fields with Mat\'ern covariance functions with smooth parameter $\nu&gt;2$. Two cases of parameter spaces, the Euclidean space and $N$-dimensional sphere, are considered. For such smooth Gaussian fields, we have derived the explicit formulae for the expected Euler characteristic of the excursion set, the expected number and height distribution of critical points. The results are valuable for approximating the excursion probability in family-wise error control and for computing p-values in peak inference.</description>

Abstract: Small noise problems are quite important for all types of stochastic differential equations. In this paper we focus on rough differential equations driven by scaled fractional Brownian rough path with Hurst parameter H between 1/4 and 1/2. We prove a moderate deviation principle for this equation as the scale parameter tends to zero.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random walk on a Galton-Watson tree whose offspring distribution has a regular varying tail of order $\kappa\in (1,2)$. We prove the convergence of the renormalised height function of the walk towards the continuous-time height process of a spectrally positive strictly stable L\'evy process, jointly with the convergence of the renormalised trace of the walk towards the continuum tree coded by the latter continuous-time height process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random polynomials $p_n(x)=\xi_0+\xi_1+\dots+\xi_n x^n$ whose coefficients are independent and identically distributed with zero mean, unit variance, and bounded $(2+\epsilon)^{th}$ moment (for some $\epsilon&gt;0$), also known as the Kac polynomials. Let $N_n$ denote the number of real roots of $p_n$. In this paper, motivated by a question from Igor Pritsker, we prove that almost surely the following convergence holds: \begin{eqnarray*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n([-1,1])}{\log n} &amp;=&amp; \frac 1 \pi. \end{eqnarray*} This convergence could be viewed as a local strong law for the real roots. The main ingredient in the proof is a set of maximal inequalities that reduces the proof to proving convergence along lacunary subsequences, which in turn follows from a recent concentration estimate of Can--Nguyen.</description>

      <title>On the large deviation principle for Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chains: the Lyapunov function condition and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an aim to analyse the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in our recent work we derive a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measures of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) chains on a continuous state space. One of the (sufficient) assumptions for the LDP involves the existence of a particular type of Lyapunov function, and it was left as an open question whether or not such a function exists for specific choices of MH samplers. In this paper we analyse the properties of such Lyapunov functions and investigate their existence for some of the most popular choices of MCMC samplers built on MH dynamics: Independent Metropolis Hastings, Random Walk Metropolis, and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. We establish under what conditions such a Lyapunov function exists, and from this obtain LDPs for some instances of the MCMC algorithms under consideration. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first large deviation results for empirical measures associated with Metropolis-Hastings chains for specific choices of proposal and target distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of high frequency path functionals of a diffusion with a singular threshold, including the case of a sticky-reflection, and establish convergence to the local time. These functionals are built upon a test function and a normalizing sequence. This advances existing results on sticky, oscillating (regime-switching) and skew or reflecting diffusions in several directions. First, it considers any normalizing sequence that diverges slower than $n$. Second, it establishes the result for a sticky-oscillating-skew (SOS) threshold. Based on this, and an approximation of the occupation time, we devise consistent skew and stickiness parameter estimators.</description>

Abstract: We construct symmetric self-similar Dirichlet forms on unconstrained Sierpinski carpets, which are natural extension of planar Sierpinski carpets by allowing the small cells to live off the $1/k$ grids. The intersection of two cells can be a line segment of irrational length, and the non-diagonal assumption is dropped in this recurrent setting.</description>

      <title>Improved covariance estimation: optimal robustness and sub-Gaussian guarantees under heavy tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an estimator of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of random $d$-dimensional vector from an i.i.d. sample of size $n$. Our sole assumption is that this vector satisfies a bounded $L^p-L^2$ moment assumption over its one-dimensional marginals, for some $p\geq 4$. Given this, we show that $\Sigma$ can be estimated from the sample with the same high-probability error rates that the sample covariance matrix achieves in the case of Gaussian data. This holds even though we allow for very general distributions that may not have moments of order $&gt;p$. Moreover, our estimator can be made to be optimally robust to adversarial contamination. This result improves the recent contributions by Mendelson and Zhivotovskiy and Catoni and Giulini, and matches parallel work by Abdalla and Zhivotovskiy (the exact relationship with this last work is described in the paper).</description>

This generalizes the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem of the case k=1. The proof relies on poissonization and a connection with variants of the Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis particle system.</description>
