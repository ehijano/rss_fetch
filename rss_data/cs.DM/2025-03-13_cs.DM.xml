      <title>The Zarankiewicz Problem for Polygon Visibility Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quasi-linear upper bound on the size of $K_{t,t}$-free polygon visibility graphs. For visibility graphs of star-shaped and monotone polygons we show a linear bound. In the more general setting of $n$ points on a simple closed curve and visibility pseudo-segments, we provide an $O(n \log n)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(n\alpha(n))$ lower bound.</description>

      <title>Face covers and rooted minors in bounded genus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A {\em rooted graph} is a graph together with a designated vertex subset, called the {\em roots}. In this paper, we consider rooted graphs embedded in a fixed surface. A collection of faces of the embedding is a {\em face cover} if every root is incident to some face in the collection. We prove that every $3$-connected, rooted graph that has no rooted $K_{2,t}$ minor and is embedded in a surface of Euler genus $g$, has a face cover whose size is upper-bounded by some function of $g$ and $t$, provided that the face-width of the embedding is large enough in terms of $g$. In the planar case, we prove an unconditional $O(t^4)$ upper bound, improving a result of B\"ohme and Mohar~\cite{BM02}. The higher genus case was claimed without a proof by B\"ohme, Kawarabayashi, Maharry and Mohar~\cite{BKMM08}.</description>

      <title>Automatic Operator-level Parallelism Planning for Distributed Deep Learning -- A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the artificial intelligence community advances into the era of large models with billions of parameters, distributed training and inference have become essential. While various parallelism strategies-data, model, sequence, and pipeline-have been successfully implemented for popular neural networks on main-stream hardware, optimizing the distributed deployment schedule requires extensive expertise and manual effort. Further more, while existing frameworks with most simple chain-like structures, they struggle with complex non-linear architectures. Mixture-of-experts and multi-modal models feature intricate MIMO and branch-rich topologies that require fine-grained operator-level parallelization beyond the capabilities of existing frameworks. We propose formulating parallelism planning as a scheduling optimization problem using mixed-integer programming. We propose a bi-level solution framework balancing optimality with computational efficiency, automatically generating effective distributed plans that capture both the heterogeneous structure of modern neural networks and the underlying hardware constraints. In experiments comparing against expert-designed strategies like DeepSeek's DualPipe, our framework achieves comparable or superior performance, reducing computational bubbles by half under the same memory constraints. The framework's versatility extends beyond throughput optimization to incorporate hardware utilization maximization, memory capacity constraints, and other considerations or potential strategies. Such capabilities position our solution as both a valuable research tool for exploring optimal parallelization strategies and a practical industrial solution for large-scale AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Number of Pieces in Continuous Piecewise Affine Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of continuous piecewise affine (CPA) functions can be measured by the number of pieces $p$ or the number of distinct affine functions $n$. For CPA functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, this paper shows an upper bound of $p=O(n^{d+1})$ and constructs a family of functions achieving a lower bound of $p=\Omega(n^{d+1-\frac{c}{\sqrt{\log_2(n)}}})$.</description>

      <title>Moving a Derivation Along a Derivation Preserves the Spine in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two elementary operations on derivations in the framework of graph transformation based on adhesive categories: moving a derivation along a derivation based on parallel and sequential independence on one hand and restriction of a derivation with respect to a monomorphism into the start object on the other hand. Intuitively, a restriction clips off parts of the start object that are never matched by a rule application throughout the derivation on the other hand. As main result, it is shown that moving a derivation preserves its spine being the minimal restriction.</description>

      <title>Permanent of bipartite graphs in terms of determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the permanent of a $(0,1)$-matrix is a well-known $\#P$-complete problem. In this paper, we present an expression for the permanent of a bipartite graph in terms of the determinant of the graph and its subgraphs, obtained by successively removing rows and columns corresponding to vertices involved in vertex-disjoint $4k$-cycles. Our formula establishes a general relationship between the permanent and the determinant for any bipartite graph. Since computing the permanent of a biadjacency matrix is equivalent to counting the number of its perfect matchings, this approach also provides a more efficient method for counting perfect matchings in certain types of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Tensors and Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lov\'asz (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of all graphs, i.e. for every graph $F$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Recently, homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted classes of graphs such as bounded treewidth, bounded treedepth and planar graphs, has emerged as a surprisingly powerful framework for capturing diverse equivalence relations on graphs arising from logical equivalence and algebraic equation systems.
  In this paper, we provide a unified algebraic framework for such results by examining the linear-algebraic and representation-theoretic structure of tensors counting homomorphisms from labelled graphs. The existence of certain linear transformations between such homomorphism tensor subspaces can be interpreted both as homomorphism indistinguishability over a graph class and as feasibility of an equational system. Following this framework, we obtain characterisations of homomorphism indistinguishability over several natural graph classes, namely trees of bounded degree and graphs of bounded pathwidth, answering a question of Dell et al. (2018), and graphs of bounded treedepth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the exact value of the $2$-edge-coloring Ramsey number of a connected $4$-clique matching $c(nK_4)$, which is a set of connected graphs containing an $nK_4$ is $13n-3$ for any positive integer $n \geq 3$. This is an extension of the result by Roberts (2017), which is proved only for $n\geq 18$. We also show that the result still holds when $n=2$ provided that $R_2(2K_4) \leq 23$.</description>

      <title>A computer algebra package for bivariate asymptotics with explicit error terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making use of a newly developed package in the computer mathematics system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis of certain types of sums that occur frequently in combinatorics, including explicit error bounds. We present two applications of the general approach to illustrate its use: the first concerns a classical problem due to Ramanujan, while the second one concerns a question of B\'ona and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.</description>

      <title>The Closed Geodetic Game: algorithms and strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodetic closure of a set S of vertices of a graph is the set of all vertices in shortest paths between pairs of vertices of S. A set S of vertices in a graph is geodetic if its geodetic closure contains all the vertices of the graph. Buckley introduced in 1984 the idea of a game where two players construct together a geodetic set by alternately selecting vertices, the game ending when all vertices are in the geodetic closure. The Geodetic Game was then studied in 1985 by Buckley and Harary, and allowed players to select vertices already in the geodetic closure of the current set. We study the more natural variant, also introduced in 1985 by Buckley and Harary and called the Closed Geodetic Game, where the players alternate adding to a set S vertices that are not in the geodetic closure of S, until no move is available. This variant was only studied ever since for trees by Araujo et al. in 2024. We provide a full characterization of the Sprague-Grundy values of graph classes such as paths and cycles, of the outcomes of the Cartesian product of several graphs in function of their individual outcomes, and give polynomial-time algorithms to determine the Sprague-Grundy values of cactus and block graphs.</description>
