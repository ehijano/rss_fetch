      <title>Radiation Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of sub-Eddington Circumbinary Disk around an Equal-mass Massive Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.</description>

      <title>Implications of {\sigma}-cut potential on Antikaon condensates in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensation in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) model with a $\sigma$-cut potential. The well-known RMF models, TM1 and TM1e, are used to analyze the structure and composition of neutron stars. The antikaon condensation part of the equation of state (EoS) is constrained from the experimental data of K$^{-}$ atomic and kaon-nucleon scattering. The $\sigma$-cut potential, which is known to make the EoS stiffer at high densities, is modulated by a free parameter $f_{s}$. Our present analysis suggests that one can obtain neutron star configurations heavier than 2$M_{\odot}$ with antikaon condensates in most cases for $f_{s}$ = 0.6. The antikaon phase transition is a second-order for $f_{s}$ = 0.6 for both TM1 and TM1e parameter sets. The calculated global properties of neutron stars with antikaon condensates i.e., mass and radius seem to be in resonable agreement with other theoretical and observational data.</description>

      <title>Detection of [C\,{\sc i}] Emission in Nebular Spectra of a Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2022pul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN~2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia supernova), which shows prominent [O\,{\sc i}], [Ne\,{\sc i}], and [Ca\,{\sc ii}] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\sim+$300 days after the peak brightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this peculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In particular, in the $t\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first time the presence of narrow emission from [C\,{\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda9824, 9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O\,{\sc i}] $\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger model that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in the center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the degree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that of oxygen ($\sim$0.06 $M_{\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\lesssim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white dwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the primary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a super-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.</description>

      <title>Two-component jet model for the afterglow emission of GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A and implications for jet structure of very-high-energy gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, afterglow emission in the very-high-energy (VHE) band above 100 GeV have been clearly detected for at least five gamma-ray bursts (GRBs 180720B, 190114C, 190829A, 201216C and 221009A). For some of these VHE GRBs, we previously proposed a two-component jet model, consisting of two uniform jets with narrow and wide opening angles to explain their multiwavelength afterglows including VHE gamma rays. In this paper, we show that the VHE emission from GRBs 201216C and 221009A can be also explained by our two-component jet model. We find that the collimation-corrected kinetic energy of the five VHE GRBs have typical values of 5\times10^{49} erg and 5\times10^{50} erg for the narrow and wide jets, respectively. We discuss the similarities and differences among the VHE GRBs, and the implications for the structure of their jets. In particular, the narrow jet of GRB 221009A has a smaller opening angle, which can explain why its isotropic-equivalent energy is unusually large.</description>

      <title>Modulation of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum in an anisotropic diffusion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel diffusion model for the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) that incorporates an anisotropic diffusion tensor of a general form within a realistically modeled large-scale Galactic magnetic field. The parameters of the model are consistent with the contemporary understanding of the large-scale Galactic magnetic field structure and the dynamics of small-scale turbulent CR propagation. The paper demonstrates the modulation of spectra of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) in the magnetic rigidity range of 1 - 30 PV (the CR knee) and explores the spatial variation of this phenomenon. The observed modulation of the spectrum is explained by changes in the leakage mechanism.</description>

      <title>Bias-corrected Fast Radio Bursts Population and Spectra Using CHIME Injection Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a class of millisecond-scale, highly energetic phenomena with unknown progenitors and radiation mechanisms, require proper statistical analysis as a key method for uncovering their mysteries. In this research, we build upon the bias correction method using pulse injections for the first CHIME/FRB catalog, to include correlations between properties, and to analyze the FRB population spectrum. This model includes six FRB properties: dispersion measure (DM), pulse width, scattering timescale, spectral index, spectral running, and fluence. By applying the multidimensional weight function calculated by the model, we update the corrected distributions, suggesting that more low-DM, short and long-width, and short-scattering timescale events may exist. Using one-off events and the first bursts from repeaters, the derived intrinsic population spectrum has a best-fit power-law of $F(\nu)\propto\nu^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha=-2.29\pm0.29$. This confirms previous indications that FRBs are brighter or more numerous at low frequencies. Analysing non-repeaters only, we find $\alpha=-2.50\pm0.43$, while including all bursts from repeaters produces $\alpha=-1.91\pm0.20$. This hints that active repeaters, low-rate repeaters, and non-repeaters may have different progenitors, mechanisms, or evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>Fermi-detection of gamma-ray Emissions from the Hot Coronae of Radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Electron Spectral Hardening in AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the electron cosmic-ray spectrum from AMS-02, focusing on the spectral hardening around 42 GeV. Our findings confirm that this feature is intrinsic to the primary electron component rather than a byproduct of contamination from primary positron sources. Even under conservative assumptions, its significance remains at about $7\sigma$, strongly indicating a genuine spectral break. Accordingly, we introduce a new, more realistic parametric fit, which we recommend for the next round of AMS-02 analyses. Once the sources of systematic uncertainties are better constrained, this refined approach can either reinforce or refute our conclusions, providing a clearer understanding of the observed electron spectrum. If confirmed, we propose that this hardening most likely arises from interstellar transport or acceleration effects.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy signal of UHECRs from a structured magnetized Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising isotropy of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sky makes it difficult to identify their sources. Observables such as energy spectrum, mass composition and arrival directions are affected by interactions with background photon fields and by deflection in the extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields (EGMF and GMF). In this work, we simulate the propagation of UHECRs with energy above 8 EeV in magnetized replicas of the local Universe, obtained from constrained simulations of the Large Scale Structure. We obtain the real magnetic deflection in structured EGMF models with realistic three-dimensional simulations. We investigate different scenarios for the UHECR source distributions and densities. The effect of the GMF can be different depending on the field model considered. In this work we consider the JF12 model by mapping the arrival directions at the edge of the galaxy to those at Earth. We study the arrival direction distribution of the propagated UHECRs, and in particular their angular power spectrum, dipole and quadrupole moments. We find that the properties of the source distribution affect the cosmic ray anisotropy more than the EGMF model considered. In particular, the low multipole components depend on both the source distribution and the density. We also find that it is difficult to simultaneously reproduce the observed dipole and quadrupole values above EeV. In general, we predict too large a quadrupole strength, incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>The dependence of Polarization Degree of Blazars on particle energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism to predict the Polarization Degree (PD) for synchrotron emission from particles having a specified energy distribution in the presence of an ordered and random magnetic field configuration. The broad band spectral energy distribution as well as the X-ray and optical PD data for Mrk 501 have been fitted using the formalism. As reported earlier, we find that for a broken power law particle energy distribution, the PD cannot be explained, unless it is assumed that the higher energy particles experience a higher ordered magnetic field compared to the lower energy ones. On the other hand, a log parabola particle energy distribution can explain the observed higher X-ray PD compared to the optical, even when all the particles experience the same magnetic configuration. We discuss the possibility of distinguishing the two scenarios using future observations.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Transient Classification: From Simulations to Real Data and ZTF to LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become essential for automated classification of astronomical transients, but current approaches face significant limitations: classifiers trained on simulations struggle with real data, models developed for one survey cannot be easily applied to another, and new surveys require prohibitively large amounts of labelled training data. These challenges are particularly pressing as we approach the era of the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), where existing classification models will need to be retrained using LSST observations. We demonstrate that transfer learning can overcome these challenges by repurposing existing models trained on either simulations or data from other surveys. Starting with a model trained on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, we show that transfer learning reduces the amount of labelled real ZTF transients needed by 75\% while maintaining equivalent performance to models trained from scratch. Similarly, when adapting ZTF models for LSST simulations, transfer learning achieves 95\% of the baseline performance while requiring only 30\% of the training data. These findings have significant implications for the early operations of LSST, suggesting that reliable automated classification will be possible soon after the survey begins, rather than waiting months or years to accumulate sufficient training data.</description>

      <title>Perturbative and non-linear analyses of gravitational turbulence in spacetimes with stable light rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some black hole mimickers, as well as black strings and other higher-dimensional spacetimes, exhibit stable light rings-regions where light or high-frequency gravitational waves can be trapped. In these regions, linear perturbations decay slowly, raising the possibility of nonlinear instability mechanisms. In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy for Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows stable trapping. By employing a perturbative approach, we show that the nonlinear wave equation on the sphere with dissipative terms captures several features of the full nonlinear problem. This framework allows us to confirm a previous conjecture: all higher-order energy norms grow for arbitrarily small initial fluctuation amplitudes. Additionally, we analyze the system's mode spectrum at late times, revealing an inertial range dominated by a direct energy cascade. These findings further support the notion that spacetimes with stable light rings develop weak, high-frequency radiation hair, which will not generically lead to instabilities.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the early Earth and the predicted lunar inclination is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination with five degrees requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. Since two moons are also a natural outcome of simulations of lunar formation from a protolunar disk produced a giant impact, here we show that, under solar perturbation, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and two moons with orbital inclination of one degree relative to Earth's equatorial plane could lead to the merger of one moon with Earth, or the merger of the two moons or the ejection of one moon, resulting that the remaining moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator could be up to 15 degrees. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the initial large lunar inclination relative to the Earth's equator.</description>

      <title>Characterization of interstellar carbon dust analogues synthesized by dielectric barrier discharge and evolution after irradiation with 3 MeV H+</title>

Abstract: "Fluffy" hydrogenated amorphouscarbon(a-C:H)wassynthesizedusingadielectric barrier discharge plasma, driven by nanosec ond high voltage pulses at 1 kHz frequency in a helium-butane mixture. The a-C:H samples were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, laser-assisted and secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We find that a-C:H samples exhibit infrared absorption features in good agreement with those observed for carbonaceous dust in IRAS 08572+3915 galaxy. We discuss their nano to microscale structure and derive their hydrogen to carbon (H/C) ratios from the results obtained by three distinct experimental characterization techniques. Relying on the average H/C value determined by mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy, we can then constrain the absorption strengths values to those best corresponding to our dust analogue, and calculate the H/C ratio from the infrared spectra. Altogether, we find that our dust analogue consists of a dominant hydrogen-rich aliphatic network, with small, isolated, aromatic regions. The a-C:H dust analogue was then irradiated with 3 MeV H+ and subsequently analyzed ex situ. Morphological and chemical changes, including the evolution of H/C, CH2/CH3, and sp2/sp3 ratios, were observed with increasing proton fluence, indicating dehydrogenation and graphitization. Proton bombardment shifted the initial location of a-C:H in the hydrocarbon ternary phase diagram toward the central region defined by IRAS 08572+3915 observations. The decay of the 3.4 {\mu}m band with proton fluence was used to calculate CH destruction cross-sections, results consistent with a direct effect of cosmic rays on the disappearance of the 3.4 {\mu}m band.</description>

      <title>X-ray and CO-Derived Column Densities in AGN: A Study of Obscuration Properties in CTAGN and Non-CTAGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obscuration in active galactic nuclei (AGN) provides insights into the material surrounding the central engine. Compton-thick AGN (CTAGN), characterized by a column density of $N_{\mathrm{H}} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, are heavily obscured by dust and gas. While X-ray observations primarily determine this column density, the sub-mm obscuration properties of CTAGN remain less explored. We analyze archival ALMA CO(3-2) data for CTAGN and non-CTAGN from the 70-month $\textit{Swift}$/BAT catalog and other X-ray surveys. Integrated intensity maps (moment 0) reveal dense gas concentrated around the nucleus. Assuming a constant CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor, $X_{\mathrm{CO}} = 2.2 \times 10^{20} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \ (\mathrm{K\ km\ s}^{-1})^{-1}$, we find that molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) are generally lower than X-ray-derived total hydrogen column densities ($N_{\mathrm{H}}$). However, $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ values in this work are slightly higher than in previous studies due to the adopted conversion factor. The discrepancy between $N_{\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ aligns with prior findings that X-ray-derived values tend to be higher, except for non-CTAGN, where $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ can exceed $N_{\mathrm{H}}$. Kendall and Spearman tests indicate a positive monotonic correlation, though not statistically significant, suggesting a complex interplay of factors. The optically thick nature of CO in dense regions may contribute to the observed differences. Our results highlight the need for an accurate CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor in deriving column densities, potentially offering an alternative method for identifying CTAGN. Future studies with larger datasets and refined methodologies are essential for a deeper understanding of sub-mm and X-ray properties in AGN.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Origin of Solar Energetic Electrons II: Investigating Turbulent Coronal Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-thermal particle acceleration in the solar corona is evident from both remote hard X-ray (HXR) sources in the chromosphere and direct in-situ detection in the heliosphere. Correlation of spectral indices between remote and in-situ energy spectra presents the possibility of a common source acceleration region within the corona, however the properties and location of this region are not well constrained. To investigate this we perform a parameter study for both the properties of the ambient plasma of a simulated acceleration region and the turbulent acceleration profile acting on an initially isotropic thermal electron population. We find that the independently varying the turbulent acceleration timescale $\tau_{acc}$, acceleration profile standard deviation ${\sigma}$ and acceleration region length L result in in-situ spectral index variation of between 0.5 and 2.0 at 1.0 AU for &lt; 100 keV electrons. Short timescale turbulent scattering in the flaring corona steepens the spectra by $\sim$ 0.5. It was also found that the in-situ spectral index $\delta$ derived from the peak electron flux produces a spectral index $\sim$ 1.6 harder than that from a full-flare X-ray photon flux (of spectral index $\gamma$) simulated with the same intermediate parameters. Previous studies have indicated an approximate $\delta \approx \gamma$ relationship for selected flares with measured in-situ electron and X-ray photon observations, suggesting that an extended source region with non-uniform plasma and/or acceleration properties may be necessary to reproduce this relationship.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski Gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <title>Probing a low-mass $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson at IceCube and prospects for IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts a new massive gauge boson, $Z'$, on astrophysical neutrino events at the IceCube Observatory. This new gauge boson couples with leptons from the second and third families, and would break the power law of the astrophysical neutrino flux due to the interaction of this flux with the cosmic neutrino background. We derive the sensitivity of the IceCube to this model considering the HESE data from 12 years of observation by assuming different assumptions for the redshift distributions of astrophysical neutrino sources, mass ordering, and sum of neutrino masses. Our results indicate that the current IceCube data is able to probe small coupling and masses of the order of some few MeV, with the covered parameter space being larger if a distribution of neutrino sources is described by the star formation rate model. In addition, we demonstrate that the IceCube-Gen2 will cover a large region of the parameter space and will allow us to improve our understanding of the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model.</description>

      <title>Evidence of mini-jet emission in a large emission zone from a magnetically-dominated gamma-ray burst jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second brightest GRB in history, GRB230307A, provides an ideal laboratory to study the mechanism of GRB prompt emission thanks to its extraordinarily high photon statistics and its single episode activity. Here we demonstrate that the rapidly variable components of its prompt emission compose an overall broad single pulse-like profile. Although these individual rapid components are aligned in time across all energy bands, this overall profile conspires to show a well-defined energy-dependent behavior which is typically seen in single GRB pulses. Such a feature demonstrates that the prompt emission of this burst is from many individual emitting units that are casually linked in a emission site at a large distance from the central engine. Such a scenario is in natural consistency with the internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence framework, which invokes many mini-jets due to local magnetic reconnection that constantly appear and disappear in a global magnetically-dominated jet.</description>

      <title>Two 100 TeV neutrinos coincident with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2013, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux. The origin of this flux is still largely unknown. The most significant individual source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2-sigma level with a soft spectral index. To identify sources based on their counterpart, IceCube releases realtime alerts corresponding to neutrinos with a high probability of astrophysical origin. We report here the spatial coincidence of two neutrino alerts, IC220424A and IC230416A, with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at a distance of 70 Mpc. We evaluate, a-posteriori, the chance probability of such a coincidence and discuss this source as a potential neutrino emitter based on its multi-wavelength properties and in comparison to NGC 1068 by performing a Goodness-of-Fit test. The test statistic is derived from a likelihood ratio that includes the neutrino angular uncertainty and the source distance. We apply this test first to a catalog of AGN sources and second to a catalog of Seyfert galaxies only. Our a-posteriori evaluation excludes the possibility of an accidental spatial coincidence of both neutrinos with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 at 3.2-sigma level, leaving open the possibility that either one or both neutrinos originated from the source. To be compatible with non-detections of TeV neutrinos, the source would need to have a hard spectral index.</description>

      <title>Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption Events around Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rates of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been extensively calculated using the loss cone theory, while theoretical work on TDE rates around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) has been lacking. In this work, we aim to accurately calculate the IMBH TDE rates based on their black hole (BH) masses and the stellar profiles of their host galaxies obtained from the latest observations. We find that the TDE rate per galaxy for IMBHs in the center of small galaxies is similar to that of SMBH TDEs, while the TDE rate per cluster from IMBHs in globular clusters is much lower. Very interestingly, we show that the rate of IMBH TDEs generally increases with the BH mass, which is opposite to the trend seen in SMBH TDEs. As a result, the volumetric TDE rate peaks around a BH mass of 10^6 M. The IMBH TDEs from galactic nuclei have an overall volumetric rate comparable to SMBH TDEs at ~10^-7 Mpc^-3 yr^-1, and off-center IMBH TDEs from globular clusters have a volumetric rate that is one or two orders of magnitude lower, assuming that their occupation fraction varies within 10%-100%. Furthermore, we report that IMBH TDEs typically occur in the pinhole regime, which means that deeply plunging events are more likely for IMBH TDEs compared to SMBH TDEs.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the astrophysical neutrino flux discovered by IceCube remains largely unknown. Several individual neutrino source candidates were observed. Among them is the gamma-ray flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. A similar coincidence of a high-energy neutrino and a gamma-ray flare was found in blazar PKS 0735+178. By modeling the spectral energy distributions of PKS 0735+178, we expect to investigate the physical conditions for neutrino production during different stages of the source activity. We analyze the multi-wavelength data during the selected periods of time. Using numerical simulations of radiation processes in the source, we study the parameter space of one-zone leptonic and leptohadronic models and find the best-fit solutions that explain the observed photon fluxes. We show the impact of model parameter degeneracy on the prediction of the neutrino spectra. We show that the available mutli-wavelength data are not sufficient to predict the neutrino spectrum unambiguously. Still, under the condition of maximal neutrino flux, we propose a scenario in which 0.2 neutrino events are produced during the 50 days flare.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of population inversions in relativistic plasmas through nonresonant interactions with Alfv\'en waves and their applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron maser emission is a leading candidate to explain the coherent emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). This mechanism requires a population inversion in order to operate. We show that nonresonant interactions between Alfv\'{e}n waves and a relativistic plasma result in the formation of population inversions across a wide range of magnetizations, $\sigma\gtrsim10^{-4}$, and temperatures, $10^{-2} \leq k_bT/mc^2 \leq 3$, spanning the parameters expected in FRB environments. We calculate the fraction of energy contained in the inversion across the whole of this parameter space for the first time and we show that energy fractions of $f_{inv}\gtrsim10^{-2}$ are achieved for high magnetizations $\sigma &gt;1$. The population inversion forms on time-scales compatible with the typical dynamical time-scales of magnetars for all magnetizations. Furthermore, we provide physical explanations for the behaviour of the interaction in different magnetization regimes, and identify the important characteristic values at which this behaviour changes. We also show that the mechanism is capable of producing an FRB signal at GHz frequencies in a relativistic magnetar wind close to the light cylinder and that this signal can escape the magnetar environment without significant damping.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz Invariance Violation for spectral lag transition in GRB 160625B using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for GRB 160625B using frequentist inference in order to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were previously obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set one-sided lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 2.55 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 1.85 \times 10^7$ GeV at 95\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof-of-principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.</description>

      <title>Forecasting of the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons in the AMS-02 era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.</description>

      <title>Repeated pattern of $\gamma$-ray flares in the blazar PKS 1502+106 coincident with the IC190730A neutrino event</title>

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that at least 10 percent of the brightest blazars in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources exhibit repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares. These events may be associated with the presence of a non-uniform sheath surrounding a fast jet spine in some blazars. Theoretical models suggest that such a sheath could facilitate neutrino production in these structured jets. We aim to test the marginal statistical evidence previously reported for a connection between repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares in blazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with these sources. We identified a repeating pattern of flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the blazar PKS 1502+106, which lies within the 50\% uncertainty region of the IC190730A neutrino candidate event. This occurrence is combined with two other high-energy ($\ge 200$ TeV) neutrino events from ICECAT-1, which arrived in both positional and temporal coincidence with two blazars exhibiting ongoing repeating flare patterns. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the likelihood of accidental coincidences between the repeating flare patterns and neutrino events, accounting for potential unrecognized systematic uncertainties in the arrival directions of the ICECAT-1 events. Our findings indicate the probability of a random coincidence, in both time and arrival direction for three high-energy neutrino candidates and three blazars with ongoing recurring patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares, is $1.56\times 10^{-3}$ ($3.2\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Rapidly spinning dark matter-admixed neutron stars</title>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars, representing the older neutron star population, are believed to have undergone a prolonged period of dark matter accumulation, resulting in a higher dark matter content. Their extreme rotation makes them unique laboratories for studying rapidly rotating neutron stars admixed with dark matter. In this work, we model uniformly rotating neutron stars with a dark matter component that rotates independently from the baryon matter, allowing for the investigation of both co-rotating and counter-rotating scenarios. We examine the impact of dark matter rotation on the macroscopic properties of neutron stars, including the mass-radius relation, the mass-shedding Keplerian limit, and moments of inertia, for various dark matter particle masses and total fractions, considering both core and halo distributions. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of how dark matter influences the equilibrium properties of rotating neutron stars, offering new insights into the astrophysical implications of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses. While the dependence of the collapse time on mass and concentration implies such behaviour, our semi-analytical approach allows us to quantify and illustrate this trend clearly across the full mass spectrum of subhalos, including for subhalo masses below the resolution limit of any current cosmological SIDM simulation. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

      <title>Discriminating sub-TeV gamma and hadron-induced showers through their footprints</title>

Abstract: Gamma/hadron discrimination in ground-based gamma-ray observatories at the sub-TeV energy range is challenging as traditional muon-based methods become less effective at lower energies. This work explores a novel gamma/hadron discrimination method for Extensive Air Shower arrays that analyzes the shower signal footprint patterns using a state-of-the-art pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT). The resilience of the method to background noise, such as atmospheric muons and low-energy proton showers, along with its adaptability to different zenith angles and array configurations, demonstrates its potential for application in current and future ground-based gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Frozen and $\beta$-equilibrated $f$ and $p$ modes of cold neutron stars: nuclear metamodel predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the chemical re-equilibration timescale is sufficiently long, the normal and quasi-normal mode frequencies of neutron stars should be calculated in the idealized limit that the internal composition of each fluid element is fixed over the oscillation period. However, many studies rely on a barotropic equation of state, which implicitly overlooks potential out-of-$\beta$-equilibrium effects. To investigate possible biases arising from this assumption, we calculate the non-radial fundamental ($f$) and first pressure ($p_1$) modes for a wide range of neutron star structures, each governed by different nucleonic equations of state. This ensemble is generated using the metamodel technique, a phenomenological framework that incorporates constraints from experimental nuclear physics and chiral effective field theory. The metamodel also provides the internal composition of $\beta$-equilibrated $npe\mu$ matter, allowing us to calculate oscillation modes beyond those supported by a purely barotropic fluid. Thus, we systematically assess the impact of assuming a barotropic equation of state across various equations of state and provide a distribution of expected $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies that may be detectable by next-generation gravitational wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Assessment of Data Volume Reduction for IACTs</title>

Abstract: High energy cosmic-rays generate air showers when they enter Earth's atmosphere. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is possible using either direct detection of shower particles at mountain altitudes, or with arrays of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). Advances in the technique and larger collection areas have increased the rate at which air-shower events can be captured, and the amount of data produced by modern high-time-resolution Cherenkov cameras. Therefore, Data Volume Reduction (DVR) has become critical for such telescope arrays, ensuring that only useful information is stored long-term. Given the vast amount of raw data, owing to the highest resolution and sensitivity, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) will need robust data reduction strategies to ensure efficient handling and analysis. The CTAO data rates needs be reduced from hundreds of Petabytes (PB) per year to a few PB/year.
  This paper presents algorithms tailored for CTAO but also applicable for other arrays, focusing on selecting pixels likely to contain shower light. It describes and evaluates multiple algorithms based on their signal efficiency, noise rejection, and shower reconstruction. With a focus on a time-based clustering algorithm which demonstrates a notable enhancement in the retention of low-level signal pixels. Moreover, the robustness is assessed under different observing conditions, including detector defects. Through testing and analysis, it is shown that these algorithms offer promising solutions for efficient volume reduction in CTAO, addressing the challenges posed by the array's very large data volume and ensuring reliable data storage amidst varying observational conditions and hardware issues.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>
