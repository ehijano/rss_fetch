      <title>Analysis of RF Surface Loss in a Planar 2D Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information, determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.</description>

      <title>Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative switching rates in bistable open quantum systems: from driven Kerr oscillators to dissipative cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use path integral techniques to predict the switching rate in a single-mode bistable open quantum system. While analytical expressions are well-known to be accessible for systems subject to Gaussian noise obeying classical detailed balance, we generalize this approach to a class of quantum systems, those which satisfy the recently-introduced hidden time-reversal symmetry [1]. In particular, in the context of quantum computing, we deliver precise estimates of bit-flip error rates in cat-qubit architectures, circumventing the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results open new avenues for exploring switching phenomena in multistable single- and many-body open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Secure One-Sided Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Under Collective Attacks with Enhanced Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality, specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR) inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings demonstrate the viability of using 1sDI-QKD with current technology and highlight its advantages as a steering-based substitute for secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum description of the four-wave mixing contribution to correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs, making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and accessible usability, for an extensive application range.</description>

      <title>Early State Exclusion in 7-Qubit Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of infinite families of $N \times N$ Jacobi matrices representing the Hamiltonians of quantum spin chains with and without early state exclusion (ESE) has been shown to exist for any even $N \geq 4$. However, their existence for odd $N \geq 7$ has remained an open problem. In Section 3, we consider a chain of qubits experiencing nearest-neighbor interactions with environmental effects and present infinite families of $7 \times 7$ Jacobi matrices with and without ESE.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Pseudorandomness against Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computational pseudorandomness has emerged as a fundamental notion that spans connections to complexity theory, cryptography and fundamental physics. However, all known constructions of efficient quantum-secure pseudorandom objects rely on complexity theoretic assumptions.
  In this work, we establish the first unconditionally secure efficient pseudorandom constructions against shallow-depth quantum circuit classes. We prove that:
  $\bullet$ Any quantum state 2-design yields unconditional pseudorandomness against both $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with arbitrarily many ancillae and $\mathsf{AC}^0\circ\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with nearly linear ancillae.
  $\bullet$ Random phased subspace states, where the phases are picked using a 4-wise independent function, are unconditionally pseudoentangled against the above circuit classes.
  $\bullet$ Any unitary 2-design yields unconditionally secure parallel-query pseudorandom unitaries against geometrically local $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ adversaries, even with limited $\mathsf{AC}^0$ postprocessing.
  Our indistinguishability results for 2-designs stand in stark contrast to the standard setting of quantum pseudorandomness against $\mathsf{BQP}$ circuits, wherein they can be distinguishable from Haar random ensembles using more than two copies or queries. Our work demonstrates that quantum computational pseudorandomness can be achieved unconditionally for natural classes of restricted adversaries, opening new directions in quantum complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Co-optimization of codon usage and mRNA secondary structure using quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-optimizing mRNA sequences for both codon optimality and secondary structure is crucial for producing stable and efficacious mRNA therapeutics. Codon optimization, which adjusts nucleotide sequences to enhance translational efficiency, inherently influences mRNA secondary structure - a key determinant of molecular stability both in-vial and in-cell. Because both properties are governed by the same underlying sequence, optimizing one directly impacts the other. To address this interdependence, we introduce a novel variational framework that simultaneously optimizes codon usage and secondary structure. Our method employs a dual-objective function that balances the codon adaptation index (CAI) and minimum free energy (MFE), incorporating variational parameters for codon selection. Leveraging a hybrid quantum-classical computational strategy and building on prior advancements in quantum algorithms for secondary structure prediction, we effectively navigate this complex optimization space. We demonstrate the feasibility of executing this end-to-end workflow on real quantum hardware, using IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor. We validate our approach through both simulations and quantum hardware experiments on sequences of up to 30 nucleotides. These results highlight the potential of our framework to accelerate the design of optimal mRNA constructs for therapeutic and research applications.</description>

      <title>Programmable Exploration of Magnetic States in Lieb-Kagome Interpolated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware, offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization, and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent article claims to measure the speed of quantum particles in the classically forbidden regime where the energy of the particles is lower than the local potential, and further claims that the results of this experiment challenge Bohmian mechanics. But this interpretation of the experiment is incorrect (and dubious even in the context of ordinary quantum mechanics). A proper analysis of the system from a pilot-wave perspective shows that it predicts the same distribution of particle positions (and so the same experimental results) as ordinary quantum theory. The speed measured by the experiment in this regime is fictitious.</description>

      <title>Exploring Entanglement and Parameter Sensitivity in QAOA through Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) can be used to quantify how sensitive a quantum state reacts to changes in its variational parameters, making it a natural diagnostic for algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We perform a systematic QFI analysis of QAOA for Max-Cut on cyclic and complete graphs with $N = 4 - 10$ qubits. Two mixer families are studied, RX-only and hybrid RX-RY, with depths $p = 2, 4, 6$ and $p = 3, 6, 9$, respectively, and with up to three entanglement stages implemented through cyclic- or complete-entangling patterns. Complete graphs consistently yield larger QFI eigenvalues than cyclic graphs; none of the settings reaches the Heisenberg limit ($4N^2$), but several exceed the linear bound ($4N$). Introducing entanglement primarily redistributes QFI from diagonal to off-diagonal entries: non-entangled circuits maximize per-parameter (diagonal) sensitivity, whereas entangling layers increase the covariance fraction and thus cross-parameter correlations, with diminishing returns beyond the first stage. Leveraging these observations, we propose, as a proof of concept, a QFI-Informed Mutation (QIm) heuristic that sets mutation probabilities and step sizes from the normalized diagonal QFI. On 7- and 10-qubit instances, QIm attains higher mean energies and lower variance than equal-probability and random-restart baselines over 100 runs, underscoring QFI as a lightweight, problem-aware preconditioner for QAOA and other variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying the perfect transfer of a quantum state from one site to another, it is typically assumed that one can receive the arriving state at a specific instant in time, with perfect accuracy. Here, we study how sensitive perfect state transfer is to that timing. We design engineered spin chains which reduce their sensitivity, proving that this construction is asymptotically optimal. The same construction is applied to the task of creating superpositions, also known as fractional revival.</description>

      <title>Almost fault--tolerant quantum machine learning with drastic overhead reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Errors in the current generation of quantum processors pose a significant challenge towards practical-scale implementations of quantum machine learning (QML) as they lead to trainability issues arising from noise-induced barren plateaus, as well as performance degradations due to the noise accumulation in deep circuits even when QML models are free from barren plateaus. Quantum error correction (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but their extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state distillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This work proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum machine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations are omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected two-qubit CNOTs (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models remain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\approx0.2\%$ depolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\approx0.13\%$ under randomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such as phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates that the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of over-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a quantum state away from depolarizations. While it may take several years to build quantum processors capable of fully fault-tolerant QML, our work proposes a resource-efficient solution for trainable and high-accuracy QML implementations in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of multiscale linear transport equations via Schr\"odingerization and exponential integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for multiscale linear transport equations, combining the Schr\"odingerization method [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603] and exponential integrator while incorporating incoming boundary conditions. These two algorithms each have advantages in terms of design easiness and scalability, and the query complexity of both algorithms, $\mathcal{O}(N_vN_x^2\log N_x)$, outperforms existing quantum and classical algorithms for solving this equation. In terms of the theoretical framework, these are the first quantum Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for multiscale linear transport equation to combine the Schr\"odingerization method with an effective asymptotic-preserving schemes, which are efficient for handling multiscale problems with stiff terms.</description>

      <title>Scalable native multi-qubit gates for fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluxoniums have emerged as a compelling qubit modality for superconducting quantum computing, owing to their strong anharmonicity and high coherence. However, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of high-fidelity entangling gates in a scalable manner will be achieved or not for fluxoniums. Here, we show that fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions have the capability to implement scalable multi-qubit gates natively while remaining compatible with existing single- and two-qubit gate realizations. Within the architecture, even though qubit states are decoupled, engineered interactions in noncomputational manifolds can facilitate the realization of $(C^{\otimes N})Z$ gates (for $N\geq 2$). This is accomplished by driving qubit-state selective transitions into noncomputational manifolds. Our case studies show that CCZ, CCCZ, and CCCCZ gates with errors of approximately 0.01 (0.001) are achievable, with gate lengths of $50\,(100)\,\text{ns}$, $100\,(250)\,\text{ns}$, and $150\,(300)\,\text{ns}$, respectively. These results underscore the potential of the fluxonium architecture for scalable quantum computation through fast, high-fidelity native multi-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Approximate k-uniform states: definition, construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $k$-Uniform states are fundamental to quantum information and computing, with applications in multipartite entanglement and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Prior work has primarily focused on constructing exact $k$-uniform states or proving their nonexistence. However, due to inevitable theoretical approximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform states is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate the study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are locally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive measurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with high probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via shallow random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we establish a connection between approximate $k$-uniform states and approximate QECCs, showing that Haar random constructions yield high-performance codes with linear rates, vanishing proximity, and exponentially small failure probability while random circuits can't construct codes with linear code rate in shallow depth. Finally, we investigate the relationship between approximate QECCs and approximate quantum information masking. Our work lays the foundation for the practical application of $k$-uniform states.</description>

      <title>Autocallable Options Pricing with Integration-Based Exponential Amplitude Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive quantum algorithm tailored for pricing autocallable options, offering a full implementation and experimental validation. Our experiments include simulations conducted on high-performance computing (HPC) hardware, along with an empirical analysis of convergence to the classically estimated value. Our key innovation is an improved integration-based exponential amplitude loading technique that reduces circuit depth compared to state-of-the-art approaches. A detailed complexity analysis in a relevant setting shows an approximately 50x reduction in T-depth for the payoff component relative to previous methods. These contributions represent a step toward more efficient quantum approaches to pricing complex financial derivatives.</description>

      <title>PGKET: A Photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end, a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel. Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence of Photonic Computing (PC) and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).</description>

      <title>Wave packets, "negative times" and the elephant in the room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controversy surrounding the "tunnelling time problem" stems from the seeming inability of quantum mechanics to provide, in the usual way, a definition of the duration a particle is supposed to spend in a given region of space. For this reason, the problem is often approached from an "operational" angle. One such approach uses the position of the transmitted wave packet in order to infer the duration the particle spends in the barrier. Here we replace the barrier with a tuneable Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). With this analogy one is able, at least in principle, to achieve any advance or delay of the wave packet sent to the chosen outgoing port. The Uncertainty Principle prevents one from combining the durations spent in each arm the MZI into a meaningful duration when both arms are engaged. There is no justification for invoking "superluminal" or "negative" times, since the particle is able to arrive at the same position (and with a higher probability) if the same initial state propagates through only one arm of the MZI. The same is true, we argue, in the case of tunnelling,
  where the transmitted wave packet results from destructive interference between multiple copies of the free state, delayed relative to the free propagation</description>

      <title>Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye or by coupling to an external thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We show that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for the external pumping of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. The increase is attributed to irreversible heat transfers and the associated entropy production.</description>

      <title>Shallow-depth GHZ state generation on NISQ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on GHZ state generation under the practical constraint of limited qubit connectivity, a hallmark of current NISQ hardware. We study the GHZ state preparation across different connectivity graphs inspired by IBM and Google chip architectures, as well as random graphs that reflect distributed quantum systems. Our approach is a measurement-based protocol designed to utilize qubit connectivity constraints for the generation of GHZ states on NISQ devices. We benchmark this against a tailored version of state-of-the-art unitary-based protocols, also incorporating physical connectivity limitations. To evaluate the performance of the protocols under realistic conditions, we conducted implementations on the IBM Eagle r3 chip. Additionally, to explore near-term scalability, we performed simulations across a range of graph sizes and connectivity configurations, assessing performance based on circuit depth, the number of two-qubit gates, and measurement overhead. We observe a trade-off between the two protocols across different figures of merit. For current state-of-the-art NISQ architectures, the unitary-based protocol is more suitable, as it avoids mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward. However, the measurement-based protocol is expected to become more advantageous in the future with more error-resilient quantum devices, owing to its reduced circuit depth and consequently shorter execution times. In both settings, our proposed method provides an efficient means of leveraging the topology of qubit connections available on a given device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target many-body Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Coupled Cluster Theory for Unpolarized Cavities Exploiting Point Group Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the quantum electrodynamic coupled cluster (QED-CC)wave function ansatz, to describe the strongly coupled light-matter system in an unpolarized optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity. This is achieved by explicitly treating two cavity modes in our calculation with perpendicular polarizations and demonstrate that this ansatz preserves the symmetry of an unpolarized cavity. Furthermore, exploiting point-group symmetry enables the assignment of polaritonic excited states as well as their targeted calculation. Using our implementation, the aromatic species benzene, fluorobenzene and azulene are investigated. We demonstrate that molecules in unpolarized cavities have a complicated excited-state landscapes with a plethora of avoided-crossings. We compare the results for a cavity with a single polarization to those of an unpolarized cavity described by two perpendicular polarization vectors using the excited states of the H$_2$ molecule as an example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.</description>

      <title>Implementing Credit Risk Analysis with Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of credit risk is crucial for the efficient operation of financial institutions. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers the potential for a quadratic speed-up over classical methods used to estimate metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, numerous limitations remain in efficiently scaling the implementation of quantum circuits that solve these estimation problems. One of the main challenges is the use of costly and restrictive arithmetic that must be implemented within the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose using Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) to significantly reduce the cost of implementing the state preparation operator, which underlies QAE for credit risk analysis. We also present an end-to-end code implementation and the results of a simulation study to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its benefits.</description>

      <title>Towards System-Level Quantum-Accelerator Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are often treated as experimental add-ons that are loosely coupled to classical infrastructure through high-level interpreted languages and cloud-like orchestration. However, future deployments in both, high-performance computing (HPC) and embedded environments, will demand tighter integration for lower latencies, stronger determinism, and architectural consistency, as well as to implement error correction and other tasks that require tight quantum-classical interaction as generically as possible.
  We propose a vertically integrated quantum systems architecture that treats quantum accelerators and processing units as peripheral system components. A central element is the Quantum Abstraction Layer (QAL) at operating system kernel level. It aims at real-time, low-latency, and high-throughput interaction between quantum and classical resources, as well as robust low-level quantum operations scheduling and generic resource management. It can serve as blueprint for orchestration of low-level computational components "around" a QPU (and inside a quantum computer), and across different modalities.
  We present first results towards such an integrated architecture, including a virtual QPU model based on QEMU. The architecture is validated through functional emulation on three base architectures (x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V), and timing-accurate FPGA-based simulations. This allows for a realistic evaluation of hybrid system performance and quantum advantage scenarios. Our work lays the ground for a system-level co-design methodology tailored for the next generation of quantum-classical computing.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Hadamard Test Circuits for Nonlinear Dynamics on a Trapped-Ion Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource-efficient, low-depth implementations of quantum circuits remain a promising strategy for achieving reliable and scalable computation on quantum hardware, as they reduce gate resources and limit the accumulation of noisy operations. Here, we propose a low-depth implementation of a class of Hadamard test circuits, complemented by the development of a parameterized quantum ansatz specifically tailored for variational algorithms that exploit the underlying Hadamard test framework. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in single- and two-qubit gate counts, suggesting a reliable circuit architecture for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Building on this foundation, we tested our low-depth scheme to investigate the expressive capacity of the proposed parameterized ansatz in simulating nonlinear Burgers' dynamics. The resulting variational quantum states faithfully capture the shockwave feature of the turbulent regime and maintain high overlaps with classical benchmarks, underscoring the practical effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of hardware noise by modeling the error properties of real quantum processors and by executing the variational algorithm on a trapped-ion-based IBEX Q1 device. The outcomes of our demonstrations highlight the resilience of our low-depth scheme in the turbulent regime, consistently preparing high-fidelity variational states that exhibit strong agreement with classical benchmarks. Our work contributes to the advancement of resource-efficient strategies for quantum computation, offering a robust framework for tackling a range of computationally intensive problems across numerous applications.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum States Over Spacetime Through Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a notion of the quantum state that applies consistently across space and time is a crucial step toward formulating a relativistic quantum theory. We give an operational meaning to multipartite quantum states over arbitrary regions in spacetime through the causally agnostic measurement, the measurement scheme that can be consistently implemented independently of the causal relation between the regions. We prove that such measurements can always be implemented with interferometry, wherein the conventional density operator, the recently developed quantum state over time (QSOT), and the process matrix formalisms smoothly merge. This framework allows for a systematic study of mixed states in the temporal setting, which turn out to be crucial for modeling quantum non-Markovianity. Based on this, we demonstrate that two different ensembles of quantum dynamics can be represented by the same QSOT, indicating that they cannot be distinguished through interferometry. Moreover, our formalism reveals a new type of spatiotemporal correlation between two quantum dynamics that originates from synchronized propagation in time under time-reversal symmetry. We show that quantum systems with such correlation can be utilized as a reference frame to distinguish certain dynamics indistinguishable under time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the Discretization Error of the Discrete Generalized Quantum Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer tensor method (TTM) [Cerrillo and Cao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014, 112, 110401] can be considered a discrete-time formulation of the Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation (NZ-QME) for modeling non-Markovian quantum dynamics. A recent paper [Makri, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 5037] raised concerns regarding the consistency of the TTM discretization, particularly a spurious term at the initial time \( t=0 \). This Communication presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of TTM, clarifying the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel \( K_N \), and the continuous-time NZ-QME kernel \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \). This relationship is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as \( \Delta t \to 0 \). While TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint integral scheme proposed in Makri's work. The relative performance of various schemes for either computing accurate \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \) from exact dynamics, or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \), warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Hamiltonian Simulation via Time-Independent Dynamics in a Larger Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept quantum algorithm for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian evolution by reducing the problem to simulating a time-independent Hamiltonian in a larger space using a discrete clock Hamiltonian construction. A similar construction was first explored for this simulation problem by Watkins, Wiebe, Roggero, and Lee [PRX Quantum, 2024]. Our algorithm improves upon their work in terms of the dependence on evolution time and precision. In addition, the complexity matches the state-of-the-art simulation algorithms using other approaches. To achieve this improvement, we use Duhamel's principle to treat the clock and system Hamiltonians separately and exploit properties of Gaussian quadrature to reduce the simulation cost. Our approach demonstrates that time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation can be as efficient in a simpler framework and hence provides a new angle to model and simulate time-dependent systems.</description>

      <title>A Clockwork Quantum: Symmetry, Noise, and the Emergence of Quantum Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concise review and perspective on noise-induced synchronization and coherence protection in open quantum systems, with emphasis on recent work involving coupled spins, oscillators, and anyons. When local environments exhibit internal correlations, the structure of the noise determines which collective modes become decoherence-protected. This leads to steady-state entanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian spectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of non-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that symmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting symmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In the pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model, where the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\sigma^2(1 \pm \xi)$, and the dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \( \sigma / \gamma \). Thus, the environment not only drives decoherence but can also selectively suppress it through symmetry filtering. We also revisit historical and conceptual origins of this idea, beginning with Huygens synchronized pendulum clocks and culminating in modern non-Hermitian dynamics. Correlated noise-though classically stochastic-can organize quantum dynamics and protect coherence without direct control over the system. These insights offer a unifying view of synchronization in classical and quantum regimes, with implications for quantum sensing, engineered decoherence, and long-lived coherence in complex environments such as biological light-harvesting complexes or avian magnetoreception.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Protein Side-Chain Optimisation: Comparing Quantum to Classical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling and predicting protein configurations is crucial for advancing drug discovery, enabling the design of treatments for life-threatening diseases. A critical aspect of this challenge is rotamer optimisation - the determination of optimal side-chain conformations given a fixed protein backbone. This problem, involving the internal degrees of freedom of amino acid side-chains, significantly influences the protein's overall structure and function. In this work, we develop a resource-efficient optimisation algorithm to compute the ground state energy of protein structures, with a focus on side-chain configuration. We formulate the rotamer optimisation problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation problem and map it to an Ising model, enabling efficient quantum encoding. Building on this formulation, we propose a quantum algorithm based on the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm to explore the conformational space and identify low-energy configurations. To benchmark our approach, we conduct a classical study using custom-built libraries tailored for structural characterisation and energy optimisation. Our quantum method demonstrates a reduction in computational cost compared to classical simulated annealing techniques, offering a scalable and promising framework for protein structure optimisation in the quantum era.</description>

      <title>Photon catalysis for general multimode multi-photon quantum state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work, we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition, that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming 100% fidelity on different classes of states.</description>

      <title>Directional Codes: a new family of quantum LDPC codes on hexagonal- and square-grid connectivity hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, which we call ``Directional Codes'', that outperforms the rotated planar code (RPC) while naturally meeting the connectivity requirements of the widely adopted square-grid, and some even the sparser hexagonal-grid. The key idea is to utilise the iSWAP gate -- a natural native gate for superconducting qubits -- to construct circuits that measure the stabilisers of these qLDPC codes without the need for any long-range connections or an increased degree of connectivity. We numerically evaluate the performance of directional codes, encoding four, six and twelve logical qubits, using a common superconducting-inspired circuit-level Pauli noise model. We also compare them to the RPC and to the bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, currently the two most popular quantum LDPC code families. As a concrete example, directional codes outperform RPC by achieving better QEC performance at physical error rate $p=10^{-3}$ using only $25-66.67\%$ of the physical qubits at distance up to $10$. Our discovery represents a breakthrough in QEC code design that suggests complex long-range, high-connectivity hardware may not be necessary for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum algorithms for the hidden shift problem of complex scalar- and vector-valued functions on finite abelian groups. Given oracle access to a shifted function and the Fourier transform of the unshifted function, the goal is to find the hidden shift. We analyze the success probability of our algorithms when using a constant number of queries. For bent functions, they succeed with probability 1, while for arbitrary functions the success probability depends on the `bentness' of the function.</description>

      <title>Is the Full Power of Gaussian Boson Sampling Required for Simulating Vibronic Spectra Using Photonics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary. We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.</description>

      <title>Random approximate quantum information masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masking information into quantum correlations is a cornerstone of many quantum information applications. While there exist the no-hiding and no-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a promising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM still remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers remains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple perspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate maskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are profound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are characterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify the deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of realizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In bipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of merit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This surprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the no-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite systems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the number of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit scales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error correction is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to approximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and exponentially small correction inaccuracies. Overall, our results establish quantum information masking as a central concept in quantum information theory, bridging diverse notions across multiple domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the driven-dissipative dynamics of an array of two-level emitters, coupled to a single photonic mode, in the presence of disorder in the resonant frequencies. We introduce the notion of subradiant correlations in the dynamics, corresponding to the eigenstates of the Liouvillian with a low decay rate, that can also oscillate in time. While the usual collective subradiant states do not survive the emitter resonant frequency fluctuations, these subradiant correlations are immune to such a type of disorder. These long-living correlations exist in finite-size systems, when their lifetime is parametrically longer than in the so-called Dicke time crystal phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.</description>

Abstract: We consider free scalar relativistic field theory in finite volume taken out-of-equilibrium and show how the chaotic behavior emerges in such a quantum system for particular quench protocols. Namely, we show that for the operator local quench, correlation functions exhibit statistical properties quite close to that of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Moreover, we show that the spectral form factor for the excited state after the local quench reveals a dip-ramp-plateau structure which also supports our conjecture. Finally, we show that the spectral form factor computed directly from the spectrum clearly demonstrates this structure as well.</description>

      <title>Propagating Neutral Modes in an Intervalley Coherent State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature - the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\'e superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode. They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge and spin-valley physics in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnetic Devil's Staircase-Like Behavior in Quasiperiodic Qubit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The devil's staircase (DS) phenomenon is a fractal response of magnetization to external fields, traditionally observed in periodic ferromagnetic systems, where the commensurability between spin arrangements, lattice parameters, and external magnetic fields governs abrupt changes in magnetization. Its occurrence in aperiodic, fractal-type systems has remained largely unexplored, despite their natural compatibility with such phenomena. Using a quantum annealing device, we uncover a wealth of abrupt magnetic transitions between spin manifolds driven by increasing external magnetic fields within a simple yet effective Ising-model framework. In contrast to periodic systems, where DS arises from long-range competing interactions, our findings reveal that short-range, purely antiferromagnetic couplings in aperiodic geometries produce equally rich ground-state magnetization patterns. We demonstrate that while magnetic textures are determined by the lattice size, their formation remains remarkably robust and independent of scale, with commensurability emerging locally. Our results challenge the prevailing view that DS behavior is limited to periodic systems and establish quasiperiodic geometries as a natural host for this phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics of the Harper model with self-duality exhibits localized, diffusive, and ballistic states depending on the potential strength $V$. By adding time-dependent harmonic perturbations composed of $M$ incommensurate frequencies, we show that all states of the Harper model transition to quantum diffusive states as the perturbation strength $\epsilon$ increases for $M \geq 3$. The transition schemes and diffusion behaviors are discussed in detail and the phase diagram in the $(\epsilon,V)$ parameter space is presented.</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet: Microscopic Mechanism of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek mechanism for dissipative discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) holds for open systems transitioning from a disordered phase to a discrete time crystal (DTC). Specifically, we observe the main signatures of the KZM when the system is quenched into a DTC, which are the characteristic power-law scaling with quench time of the number of spatial defects and the transition delay measured from the time at which the system crosses the critical point. We show analytically that this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be mapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the adiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the relaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in both the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the Sine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs; and the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to quantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency, thus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal ordering.</description>

      <title>Neural network ensemble for computing cross sections for rotational transitions in H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collisions</title>

Abstract: Water (H$_2$O) is one of the most abundant molecules in the universe and is found in a wide variety of astrophysical environments. Rotational transitions in H$_2$O + H$_2$O collisions are important in modeling environments rich in water molecules but they are computationally intractable using quantum mechanical methods. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an ensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a database of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in collisions of complex molecules such as water. The proposed methodology utilizes data computed with a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT). We illustrate that efficient ML models using NN can be built to accurately interpolate in the space of 12 quantum numbers for rotational transitions in two asymmetric top molecules, spanning both initial and final states. We examine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy, symmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational transitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about 10\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of state-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with average relative root mean square error of 0.409. Thermally averaged cross sections, computed using the predicted state-to-state cross sections ($\sim$90\%) and the data used for training and validation ($\sim$10\%) were compared against those obtained entirely from MQCT calculations. The agreement is found to be excellent with an average percent deviation of about $\sim$13.5\%. The methodology is robust, and thus, applicable to other complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced photon-pair generation from a van der Waals metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum photon pairs play a pivotal role in many quantum applications. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures, have been studied intensively to enhance and control pair generation via spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Van der Waals (VdW) layered materials have emerged as promising candidates for nonlinear materials in quantum light sources, owing to their high nonlinear susceptibility and compatibility with on-chip integration. In this work, we present the first demonstration of SPDC from a metasurface composed of the VdW material 3R-MoS2. The nanoresonators support quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) with a quality factor of up to 120, enhancing light-matter interactions. This design achieves a 20-fold increase in SPDC rate compared to an unstructured film and significantly higher brightness, resulting in enhanced quantum photon-pair generation. This work establishes a new approach for utilizing van der Waals metasurfaces in the generation of quantum photon pairs, opening avenues for advanced quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping in situ the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local extra recoil effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Feature-Resolved Photoluminescence Analysis: Probing Emission Beyond Conventional Photon Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a feature-resolved methodology to analyse the photoluminescence dynamics of single emitters using a combination of lifetime, spectral, and photon correlation analyses. By integrating conventional ensemble photon statistics measurements with emission state-resolved, spectrally filtered, and lifetime-gated methods, we uncover emission dynamics that remain hidden in ensemble treatment. We study the fluorescence of single CdSe/CdS core/shell colloidal quantum dots under varying excitation powers. Using feature-resolved analysis, we understand the radiative and non-radiative recombination processes, and estimate quantum parameters. Event-selective analysis provides a versatile toolkit for characterizing emitters, both single and aggregate particles. These methods are broadly applicable to a wide class of photoluminescent emitters, such as nitrogen vacancy centres in nanodiamond, epitaxial quantum dots, and perovskite nanocrystals. The application of these lateral investigation techniques will contribute to the advancement of quantum light source development.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation Thresholds in Noisy Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04278v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting useful information from noisy near-term quantum simulations requires error mitigation strategies. A broad class of these strategies rely on precise characterization of the noise source. We study the robustness of probabilistic error cancellation and tensor network error mitigation when the noise is imperfectly characterized. We adapt an Imry-Ma argument to predict the existence of a threshold in the robustness of these error mitigation methods for random spatially local circuits in spatial dimensions $D \geq 2$: noise characterization disorder below the threshold rate allows for error mitigation up to times that scale with the number of qubits. For one-dimensional circuits, by contrast, mitigation fails at an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time for any imperfection in the characterization of disorder. As a result, error mitigation is only a practical method for sufficiently well-characterized noise. We discuss further implications for tests of quantum computational advantage, fault-tolerant probes of measurement-induced phase transitions, and quantum algorithms in near-term devices.</description>

Abstract: Equilibration plays a fundamental role in our understanding of statistical mechanics and the long-time dynamics of many-body systems. In quantum systems, the route to equilibration is intimately related to level repulsion and quantum signatures of chaos that are encoded in their unitary evolution. Chaotic quantum systems exhibit the level statistics characteristic of ensembles of random matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that single-particle chaos leads to equilibration of many non-interacting photons. We show that the underlying mechanisms for equilibration are operator spreading and quantum interference. More specifically, we demonstrate that the unitary dynamics of a general Floquet system implemented using single-mode phase shifters and multiport beamsplitters leads to equilibration of photons. We propose a realistic photonic implementation of the multiparticle kicked rotor, which is a Floquet system that we use as a concrete example of our general approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum cellular automata are alternative quantum-computing paradigms to quantum Turing machines and quantum circuits. Their working mechanisms are inherently automated, therefore measurement free, and they act in a translation invariant manner on all cells/qudits of a register, generating a global rule that updates cell states locally, i.e., based solely on the states of their neighbors. Although desirable features in many applications, it is generally not clear to which extent these fully automated discrete-time local updates can generate and sustain long-range order in the (noisy) systems they act upon. In special, whether and how quantum cellular automata can perform quantum error correction remain open questions. We close this conceptual gap by proposing quantum cellular automata with quantum-error-correction capabilities. We design and investigate two (quasi-)one dimensional quantum cellular automata based on known classical cellular-automata rules with density-classification capabilities, namely the local majority voting and the two-line voting. We investigate the performances of those quantum cellular automata as quantum-memory components by simulating the number of update steps required for the logical information they act upon to be afflicted by a logical bit flip. The proposed designs pave a way to further explore the potential of new types of quantum cellular automata with built-in quantum error correction capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.</description>

Abstract: We discuss and experimentally demonstrate the role of quantum coherence in a sequence of two measurements collected at different times using weak measurements. For this purpose, we have realized a weak-sequential measurement protocol with photonic qubits, where the first measurement is carried out as a positive operator-valued measure, whereas the second one is a projective operation. We determine the quasiprobability distributions associated to this procedure using both the commensurate and the Margenau-Hill quasiprobabilities approaches. By tuning the weak measurements, we obtain a quasidistribution that may or may not exhibit negative parts, depending on the suitability of a contextual model for describing the experiment. Our results show how quasidistributions may find application in inspecting quantum monitoring, when part of the initial quantum coherence needs to be preserved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transient dynamics of the quantum Stuart-Landau oscillator, a paradigmatic quantum system exhibiting a quantum limit cycle and synchronization. From the energy dynamics, we determine a condition for the classical regime of transient dynamics and the limit cycle. Additionally, we formulate a guess function that fits the classical-regime steady-state Wigner function. The equation of motion for the Wigner function is derived and compared to the Kramers-Moyal equation for stochastic processes. We then characterize the classical-like behavior as the system evolves from a coherent state, noting the slow decay of neighboring-level coherence. We also study the evolution of the Wigner negativity as an indicator of nonclassicality, showing its temporary increase for some specific cases. To quantify the evolution speed, we examined the system's Lindbladian spectra, particularly the Liouvillian gap. Finally, we record the time it takes to reach the steady state for some Fock, thermal, and coherent states. The parameter dependence of the steady-state time may differ from the Liouvillian gap, and the limit-cycle attraction is significantly slower for coherent states compared to Fock or thermal states. For the diagonal states, there are speedy parameters for which the steady-state time is locally minimized. This study provides a deeper insight into the transient behavior of self-sustained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To bypass the reliance on local observables in verifying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), we introduce an observable-independent measure of distinguishability based on the variance of a rescaled local operator. We establish a universal trade-off relation between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of this measure, rigorously connecting it to eigenstate typicality and spatially averaged observables. This trade-off reveals that exponential growth in the number of off-diagonal terms enforces their suppression, indirectly constraining diagonal deviations. Numerical simulations on a one-dimensional Ising spin chain with tunable transverse and longitudinal fields demonstrate stark contrasts between integrable and non-integrable regimes: While off-diagonal elements are universally suppressed with system size, diagonal suppression fails in integrable systems due to the absence of chaotic dynamics. Our results unify subsystem ETH, weak ETH, and macroscopic observables under a single framework, offering new insights into thermalization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A solution of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the generalised quantum Stein's lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $n$ copies of an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ and a generic separable state $\sigma_{A^n:B^n}$, equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of all quantum resource theories under asymptotically resource non-generating operations, with the regularised relative entropy of resource governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. As a by-product, we prove that the same Stein exponent can also be achieved when the null hypothesis is only approximately i.i.d., in the sense that it can be modelled by an 'almost power state'. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call 'blurring', which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. Blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma in the fully classical case, but not in the quantum case. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.</description>

      <title>Hacking Cryptographic Protocols with Tensor Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we introduce the application of Tensor Networks (TN) to launch attacks on symmetric-key cryptography. Our approaches make use of Matrix Product States (MPS) as well as our recently-introduced Flexible-PEPS Quantum Circuit Simulator (FQCS). We compare these approaches with traditional brute-force attacks and Variational Quantum Attack Algorithm (VQAA) methods also proposed by us. Our benchmarks include the Simplified Data Encryption Standard (S-DES) with 10-bit keys, Simplified Advanced Encryption Standard (S-AES) with 16-bit keys, and Blowfish with 32-bit keys. We find that for small key size, MPS outperforms VQAA and FQCS in both time and average iterations required to recover the key. As key size increases, FQCS becomes more efficient in terms of average iterations compared to VQAA and MPS, while MPS remains the fastest in terms of time. These results highlight the potential of TN methods in advancing quantum cryptanalysis, particularly in optimizing both speed and efficiency. Our results also show that entanglement becomes crucial as key size increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Supersinglets can be self-tested with perfect quantum strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersinglets are states of spin-zero of $d \ge 3$ particles of $d$ levels. They are invariant under unitary transformations of the form $U^{\otimes d}$ and have applications in metrology, error protection, and communication. They also violate some specific Bell inequalities. However, none any of these applications {\em require} supersinglets nor do any of these Bell inequality violations capture the unique properties of the supersinglets. This leads to two questions. Question 1 is whether there exists a task that can be solved only with supersinglets. Question 2 is whether supersinglets can produce a unique $d$-partite, $d$-dimensional nonlocal signature. We answer both questions affirmatively by presenting a protocol that self-test all supersinglets by producing $d$-partite, $d$-dimensional {\em perfect} quantum strategies for any $d \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Two fundamental solutions to the rigid Kochen-Specker set problem and the solution to the minimal Kochen-Specker set problem under one assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results show that Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of observables are fundamental to quantum information, computation, and foundations beyond previous expectations. Among KS sets, those that are unique up to unitary transformations (i.e., "rigid") are especially important. The problem is that we do not know any rigid KS set in $\mathbb{C}^3$, the smallest quantum system that allows for KS sets. Moreover, none of the existing methods for constructing KS sets leads to rigid KS sets in $\mathbb{C}^3$. Here, we show that two fundamental structures of quantum theory define two rigid KS sets. One of these structures is the super-symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measure. The other is the minimal state-independent contextuality set. The second construction provides a clue to solve the minimal KS problem, the most important open problem in this field. We prove that there is no KS set of 30 elements that can be obtained from the minimal state-independent contextuality set by completing bases and adding elements that are orthogonal to two previous elements. We conjecture that 31 is the solution to the minimal KS set problem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Generation on the Double Quantum Transition of NV Ground State Via Globally Addressing Microwave Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key quantum feature that enables quantum sensors to improve their sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. In the NV center platform, the Heisenberg limit can only be achieved when the axes of the NV centers are parallel. Nevertheless, parallel NV centers are spectrally indistinguishable and no mechanisms to directly prepare Heisenberg--limit--grade entanglement in such configurations are known to date. In this work we propose for the first time a viable mechanism to prepare entangled states in the double quantum transition of two dipolarly coupled NV centers whose axes are parallel without populating intermediate states, so as to reach the Heisenberg limit in sensing. Our approach is based on the NV effective Raman coupling (NV-ERC) protocol and makes use of global addressing of both NV centers with a single monochromatic microwave pulse. Supported by an adiabatic elimination analysis, several mechanisms for the preparation of different entangled states are identified, all of which avoid the involvement of intermediate states. This not only minimizes the impact of additional noise sources, but also enables the state generation process itself to serve as effective sensing time--an advantage over conventional approaches where such preparation typically constitutes a separate, non--contributory stage. We consider the generation of different entangled states belonging to the double quantum transition, sensitive to either transverse electric fields or longitudinal magnetic fields, all with a fourfold improved sensitivity compared to conventional single NV settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional entanglement is a valuable resource for several quantum information processing tasks, and is often characterized by the Schmidt number and specific classes of entangled states beyond qubit-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems. We propose a criterion to detect higher-dimensional entanglement, focusing on determining the Schmidt number of quantum states and identifying significant classes of positive partial transposition and negative partial transposition entangled states. Our approach relies on evaluating moments of generalized positive maps which can be efficiently simulated in real experiments without the requirement of full-state tomography. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our detection scheme through various illustrative examples. As a direct application, we explore the implications of our moment-based detection schemes in identifying useful quantum channels such as non-Schmidt-number breaking channels and non-entanglement breaking channels. Finally, we present an operational implication of our proposed moment criterion through its manifestation in channel discrimination tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparation of low-energy quantum many-body states has a wide range of applications in quantum information processing and condensed matter physics. Quantum cooling algorithms offer a promising alternative to other methods based, for instance, on variational and adiabatic principles, or on dissipative state preparation. In this work, we investigate a set of cooling algorithms in a simple, solvable fermionic model which allows us to identify the mechanisms which underlie the cooling process and, also, those which prevent it. We derive analytical expressions for the cooling dynamics, steady states, and cooling rates in the weak coupling limit. We find that multi-frequency and randomized cycle strategies can significantly enhance the performance of the quantum algorithm and circumvent some of the obstacles. We also analyze the effects of noise and evaluate the conditions under which cooling remains feasible. Furthermore, we present optimized cooling protocols that can significantly enhance cooling performance in the presence of noise. Additionally, we compare cooling and dissipative state preparation and show that, in the model analyzed here, cooling generally achieves lower energies and is more resilient to noise.</description>

Abstract: We show that a composite quantum system described by the tensor product of multiple systems each with a leading-order exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy at which not only eigenvalues but also eigenstates coalesce) exhibits a single leading-order exceptional point, whose order surpasses the order of any constituent exceptional point. The formation of such higher-order exceptional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine explicitly the order and the spectral response strength of this exceptional point. Moreover, we observe that the energy eigenstates that do not merge are entangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states disentangle during time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point of the composite system.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distributions in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Operational Protocols to Quantum Speed Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems plays a fundamental role in several scientific and technological disciplines, from quantum computing and information science to molecular electronics and quantum thermodynamics. Despite its widespread relevance, a rigorous formulation of quantum dissipation in conjunction with thermal noise remains a topic of active research. In this work, we establish a formal correspondence between classical stochastic thermodynamics, in particular the Fokker-Planck and Klein-Kramers equations, and the quantum master equation. Building on prior studies of multiplicative noise in classical stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate that thermal noise at the quantum level manifests as a multidimensional geometric stochastic process. By applying canonical quantization, we introduce a novel Hermitian dissipation operator that serves as a quantum analogue of classical viscous friction. This operator allows for a well-defined expression of heat exchange between a system and its environment, enabling the formulation of an alternative quantum equipartition theorem. Our framework ensures a precise energy balance that aligns with the first law of thermodynamics and an entropy balance consistent with the second law. The theoretical formalism is applied to two prototypical quantum systems, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in an infinite potential well, for which it provides new insights into nonequilibrium thermodynamics at the quantum scale. Our results advance the understanding of dissipation in quantum systems and establish a foundation for future studies on stochastic thermodynamics in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Solving Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems with Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) has emerged as a promising research direction. Since the introduction of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), numerous variants have been proposed to enhance its performance. QAOA was later extended to the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the initial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained problems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional ancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare the superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are challenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally hindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima. Recently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation algorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE has demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has been applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this work, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained optimization using VarQITE. We show that VarQITE achieves significantly lower mean optimality gaps compared to QAOA and other conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that scaling the Hamiltonian coefficients can further reduce optimization costs and accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Implementing Slack-Free Custom Penalty Function for QUBO on Gate-Based Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problems using quantum algorithms remains a challenging yet promising avenue toward quantum advantage. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), typically require constrained problems to be reformulated as unconstrained ones using penalty methods.A common approach introduces slack variables and quadratic penalties in the QUBO formulation to handle inequality constraints. However, this leads to increased qubit requirements and often distorts the optimization landscape, making it harder to find high-quality feasible solutions. To address these issues, we explore a slack-free formulation that directly encodes inequality constraints using custom penalty functions, specifically the exponential function and the Heaviside step function. These step-like penalties suppress infeasible solutions without introducing additional qubits or requiring finely tuned weights. Inspired by recent developments in quantum annealing and threshold-based constraint handling in gate-based algorithms, we implement and evaluate our approach on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Experimental results show that the step-based formulation significantly improves feasibility and optimality rates compared to unbalanced penalization, while reducing overall qubit overhead.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Minor-Embedding Problem in Quantum Annealing and Evaluating State-of-the-Art Algorithm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the minor-embedding problem, which involves mapping the variables of an Ising model onto a quantum annealing processor. The primary motivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers when solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with non-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems quantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated by Minorminer, the standard minor-embedding technique in the quantum annealing literature, provided by D-Wave. Regarding the first objective, our experiments reveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and the relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical influence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second objective, we evaluate Minorminer's embedding capabilities, the quality and robustness of its embeddings, and its execution-time performance. We also compare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by D-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising models into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The results demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for Minorminer, suggesting that more effective embedding strategies could lead to meaningful gains in quantum annealing performance.</description>

      <title>The abelian state hidden subgroup problem: Learning stabilizer groups and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the symmetry properties of quantum states is a central theme in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics. In this work, we investigate quantum learning problems in which the goal is to identify a hidden symmetry of an unknown quantum state. Building on the recent formulation of the state hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP), we focus on abelian groups and develop an efficient quantum algorithm that learns any hidden symmetry subgroup using a generalized form of Fourier sampling. We showcase the versatility of the approach in three concrete applications: These are learning (i) qubit and qudit stabilizer groups, (ii) cuts along which a state is unentangled, and (iii) hidden translation symmetries. Through these applications, we reveal that well-known quantum learning primitives, such as Bell sampling and Bell difference sampling, are in fact special cases of Fourier sampling. Our results highlight the broad potential of the StateHSP framework for symmetry-based quantum learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Copenhagenish interpretations of quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a class of Copenhagenish interpretations encompassing modern interpretations that follow the Copenhagen spirit. These interpretations are characterized by four postulates: Observers Observe, Universality, Anti-$\psi$-ontology, and Completeness. We explain why such interpretations are not equivalent to the textbook (or orthodox) interpretation, nor to the view that one should shut up and calculate, nor to strict operationalism. We then discuss what lessons are implied for Copenhagenish interpretations by the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend thought experiment, and the simple variants of the Wigner's friend thought experiment that we term Wigner's enemy, stalkee, and penpal. In particular, we discuss how Copenhagenish interpretations give multiple distinct descriptions of each experiment, where these descriptions are each individually true, yet cannot be combined into any single description. To make such interpretations consistent, then, one requires epistemological constraints forbidding certain perspectives from being combined. We discuss these constraints, their motivations, and some of the challenges they introduce.</description>

      <title>Universal cooling of quantum systems via randomized measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing cooling protocols is believed to require knowledge of the system spectrum. In contrast, cooling in nature occurs whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. How does nature know how to cool? A natural cold bath can be mimicked with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without knowledge of system details when system-meter interactions and meter splittings are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the protocol ensures that resonant energy-exchange processes, leading to cooling, dominate over heating. Effectively, the dynamics is then captured by the rotating-wave approximation, which we identify as the basic mechanism for robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems through generic, structure-independent protocols. This offers a versatile universal framework for controlling quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for quantum computing and simulation.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Multi-Dimensional Integration with Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm that performs Quantum Adaptive Importance Sampling (QAIS) for Monte Carlo integration of multidimensional functions, targeting in particular the computational challenges of high-energy physics. In this domain, the fundamental ingredients for theoretical predictions such as multiloop Feynman diagrams and the phase-space require evaluating high-dimensional integrals that are computationally demanding due to divergences and complex mathematical structures. The established method of Adaptive Importance Sampling, as implemented in tools like VEGAS, uses a grid-based approach that is iteratively refined in a separable way, per dimension. This separable approach efficiently suppresses the exponentially growing grid-handling computational cost, but also introduces performance drawbacks whenever strong inter-variable correlations are present. To utilize sampling resources more efficiently, QAIS exploits the exponentially large Hilbert space of a Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC) to manipulate a non-separable Probability Density Function (PDF) defined on a multidimensional grid. In this setting, entanglement within the PQC captures the correlations and intricacies of the target integrand's structure. Performing measurements on the PQC determines the sample allocation across the multidimensional grid. This focuses samples in the small subspace where the important structures of the target integrand lie, and thus generates very precise integral estimations. As an application, we look at a very sharply peaked loop Feynman integral and at multi-modal benchmark integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error and access to control-$U$ is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two protocols, with one and two two-qubit gates, to noninvasively measure two incompatible observables on a qubit. Both protocols are completed with a projective measurement. By gathering sufficiently large statistics, we have been able to violate Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order invariance. The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on IBM Quantum and one on IonQ reveals violations beyond 5 standard deviations in almost all cases. We implemented our protocols using fractional gates, newly available on the IBM Heron devices, allowing us to benchmark them in application to weak measurements. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. These results show another characteristic feature of quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Storage and Retrieval of Isometry Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding an unknown quantum channel $\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that the channel can later be retrieved. There are two strategies for this task: classical and quantum strategies. The classical strategy uses multiple queries to $\Lambda$ to estimate $\Lambda$ and retrieves the channel based on the estimate represented in classical bits. The classical strategy turns out to offer the optimal performance for the storage and retrieval of unitary channels. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic performance of the classical and quantum strategies for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels. We show that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is given by $F = 1-{d(D-d)\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the input and output dimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries. This result indicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the classical strategy is suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels, which requires $n = \Theta(\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the diamond-norm error $\epsilon$. We propose a more efficient quantum strategy based on port-based teleportation, which stores the isometry channel in a program state using only $n = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ queries, achieving a quadratic improvement over the classical strategy. As an application, we extend our approach to general quantum channels, achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by Gschwendtner, Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum 5, 488 (2021)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame, capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust. Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling, are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>

Abstract: The detection of individual charges plays a crucial role in fundamental material science and the advancement of classical and quantum high-performance technologies that operate with low noise. However, resolving charges at the lattice scale in a time-resolved manner has not been achieved so far. Here, we present the development of an electrometer with 60 ns acquisition steps, leveraging on the spectroscopy of an optically-active spin defect embedded in a solid-state material with a non-linear Stark response. By applying our approach to diamond, a widely used platform for quantum technology applications, we can distinguish the distinct charge traps at the lattice scale, quantify their impact on transport dynamics and noise generation, analyze relevant material properties, and develop strategies for material optimization.</description>

      <title>Coherent all-optical control of the germanium vacancy in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The germanium vacancy in diamond (GeV) is a promising candidate for color center based quantum networking. Yet, like for other group-IV vacancy defects in diamond, achieving fast, high-fidelity qubit operations using traditional magnetic resonance techniques is experimentally challenging due to a weak magnetic dipole and susceptibility to thermally induced decoherence. Here, we perform all-optical control of the GeV and realize Rabi frequencies exceeding $\sim 20$~MHz. We do so by driving the two $\Lambda$-systems of the GeV simultaneously and apply this to probe the spin coherence ($T_2^*=224\pm14$~ns, $T_2^{\rm H}=11.9\pm0.3$~$\mu$s). Our control scheme is applicable to other color centers and particularly, other group-IV defects for which, the scheme may be optimized to improve all-optical control in these systems.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic idealism: what should you believe to experience next?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I argue for an approach to the Foundations of Physics that puts the question in the title center stage, rather than asking "what is the case in the world?". This approach, algorithmic idealism, attempts to give a mathematically rigorous in-principle-answer to this question both in the usual empirical regime of physics and in some more exotic regimes within cosmology, philosophy, and science fiction (but soon perhaps real) technology. I begin by arguing that quantum theory, in its actual practice and in some interpretations, should be understood as telling an agent what they should expect to observe next (rather than what is the case), and that the difficulty of answering this former question from the usual "external" perspective is at the heart of persistent enigmas such as the Boltzmann brain problem, extended Wigner's friend scenarios, Parfit's teletransportation paradox, or our understanding of the simulation hypothesis. Algorithmic idealism is a conceptual framework, based on two postulates that admit several possible mathematical formalizations, cast in the language of algorithmic information theory. Here I give a non-technical description of this view and show how it dissolves the aforementioned enigmas: for example, it claims that you should never bet on being a Boltzmann brain regardless of how many there are, that shutting down computer simulations does not generally terminate its inhabitants, and it predicts the apparent embedding into an objective external world as an approximate description.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <title>Computing the graph-changing dynamics of loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), quantum states of the gravitational field are represented by labelled graphs called spinnetworks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, which modifies the spinnetwork graphs. Fixed graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features to access physically correct quantum-relativistic phenomenology from canonical LQG. Here, we introduce the first numerical tool that implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We find new solutions to this constraint and show that some quantum-geometrical observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. This work aims at fostering a new era of numerical simulations in canonical LQG that, crucially, embrace the graph-changing aspects of its dynamics, laying aside debated approximations.</description>

      <title>Taming Thiemann's Hamiltonian constraint in canonical loop quantum gravity: reversibility, eigenstates and graph-change analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian constraint remains an elusive object in loop quantum gravity because its action on spinnetworks leads to changes in their corresponding graphs. As a result, calculations in loop quantum gravity are often considered unpractical, and neither the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian constraint, which form the physical space of states, nor the concrete effect of its graph-changing character on observables are entirely known. Much worse, there is no reference value to judge whether the commonly adopted graph-preserving approximations lead to results anywhere close to the non-approximated dynamics. Our work sheds light on many of these issues, by devising a new numerical tool that allows us to implement the action of the Hamiltonian constraint without the need for approximations and to calculate expectation values for geometric observables. To achieve that, we fill the theoretical gap left in the derivations of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on spinnetworks: we provide the first complete derivation of such action for the case of 4-valent spinnetworks, while updating the corresponding derivation for 3-valent spinnetworks. Our derivations also include the action of the volume operator. By proposing a new approach to encode spinnetworks into functions of lists and the derived formulas into functionals, we implement both the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume operator numerically. We are able to transform spinnetworks with graph-changing dynamics perturbatively and verify that volume expectation values have rather different behavior from the approximated, graph-preserving results. Furthermore, using our tool we find a family of potentially relevant solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint. Our work paves the way to a new generation of calculations in loop quantum gravity, in which graph-changing results and their phenomenology can finally be accounted for and understood.</description>

      <title>Quasi-$\Phi_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Universal Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hoeffding's formulation and solution to the universal hypothesis testing (UHT) problem had a profound impact on many subsequent works dealing with asymmetric hypotheses. In this work, we introduce a quantum universal hypothesis testing framework that serves as a quantum analog to Hoeffding's UHT. Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the eigenstates, that is, the wavefunctions of Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells and derive expressions relating them to the oscillator strengths of different exciton states. Using the B-spline expansion, we compute the wavefunctions in coordinate space and estimate the oscillator strengths. The symmetry properties of the states and the non-separability of the wavefunctions are illustrated. Wavefunctions associated with resonances above the scattering threshold, in particular those of bound states in the continuum as well as their partner states, are also given.</description>

      <title>Spin current compensation from competing magnon modes in ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG), focusing on the mode-resolved dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnons and their impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnets support both right-handed and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings, our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory and a new type of universal quantum spin chain quench behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss different quench protocols for Ising and XY spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a starting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden quenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we show that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with non-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time, apart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for. As the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing the discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation expansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements on functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time $t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is analytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at $p=0$ and possibly others with $\Im (p) &lt; 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to zero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane. A prototypical function of this class is $\tanh(\eta t)$, to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the switching at time $t=0$. In the limit of large $\eta$, such a perturbation approaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new type of universal behavior of Loschmidt echo (LE) that emerges in an exponentially short time scale, our previous results for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains, obtained by the resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long-time limit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial modifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous universal behavior exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Volatility from the P\"oschl-Teller Potential and Hyperbolic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes a formal equivalence between the generalized Black-Scholes equation under a Quadratic Normal Volatility (QNV) specification and the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for a hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential. A sequence of canonical transformations maps the financial pricing operator to a quantum Hamiltonian, revealing the volatility smile as a direct manifestation of diffusion on a hyperbolic manifold whose geometry is classified by the discriminant of the QNV polynomial. We perform a complete spectral analysis of the financial Hamiltonian, deriving its discrete and continuous spectra and constructing the pricing kernel from the resulting eigenfunctions, which are given by classical special functions. This analytical framework, grounded in a gauge-theoretic perspective, furnishes a non-trivial benchmark for derivative pricing and provides a fundamental geometric interpretation of market anomalies. Future research trajectories toward integrable systems and formal field-theoretic analogies are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we examine the detection of oligonucleotide-specific signals in sensitive optomechanical experiments. Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were functionalized using ZnCl$_2$ and 25-mers of single-stranded deoxyadenosine and deoxythymidine monophosphate which were optically trapped by a 1550 nm wavelength laser in vacuum. In the optical trap, SiNPs behave as harmonic oscillators, and their oscillation frequency and amplitude can be precisely detected by optical interferometry. The data was compared across particle types, revealing differences in frequency, width and amplitude of peaks with respect to motion of the SiNPs which can be explained by a theoretical model. Data obtained from this platform was analyzed by fitting Lorentzian curves to the spectra. Linear discriminant analysis detected differences between the functionalized and non-functionalized SiNPs. Random forest modeling provided further evidence that the fitted data were different between the groups. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out, but did not reveal any visual differences between the particle types</description>
