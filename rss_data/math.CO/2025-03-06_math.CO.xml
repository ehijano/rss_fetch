      <title>Descents and flag major index on conjugacy classes of colored permutation groups without short cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the descent and flag major index statistics on the colored permutation groups, which are wreath products of the form $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}=\mathbb{Z}_r\wr \mathfrak{S}_n$. We show that the $k$-th moments of these statistics on $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ will coincide with the corresponding moments on all conjugacy classes without cycles of lengths $1,2,\ldots,2k$. Using this, we establish the asymptotic normality of the descent and flag major index statistics on conjugacy classes of $\mathfrak{S}_{n,r}$ with sufficiently long cycles. Our results generalize prior work of Fulman involving the descent and major index statistics on the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Our methods involve an intricate extension of Fulman's work on $\mathfrak{S}_n$ combined with the theory of the degree for a colored permutation statistic, as introduced by Campion Loth, Levet, Liu, Sundaram, and Yin.</description>

      <title>Hosoya Polynomials of Mycielskian Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerability measures and topological indices are crucial in solving various problems such as the stability of the communication networks and development of mathematical models for chemical compounds. In 1947, Harry Wiener introduced a topological index related to molecular branching. Since then, more than 100 topological indices for graphs were introduced. Many graph polynomials play important roles in measuring such indices. Hosoya polynomial is among many of them. Introduced by Hosoya in 1988, the Hosoya polynomial of a given graph $G$ is a polynomial with the coefficients being the numbers of pairs of vertices in $G$ with all possible distances. For a given graph $G$, an extension graph is called Mycielskian graph of $G$, defined by Mycielski in 1955. In this paper, we investigate relationships between the Hosoya polynomial of any graph and that of its Mycielskian graph. The results are applied to compute the vulnerability measures, closeness and betweenness centrality, and the extended Wiener indices of selected graphs and their Mycielskian graphs. In the network science, these measures are commonly used to describe certain connectivity properties of a network. It is fascinating to see how graph polynomials are useful in other scientific fields.</description>

      <title>The Littlewood decomposition via colored Frobenius partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Littlewood decomposition for partitions is a well-known bijection between partitions and pairs of $t$-core and $t$-quotient partitions. This decomposition can be described in several ways, such as the $t$-abacus method of James or the biinfinite word method of Garvan, Kim, and Stanton. In a recent study, Frobenius partitions have proven to be a highly useful tool in dealing with partition statistics related to $t$-core partitions. Motivated by this study, in this paper, we present an alternative description of the Littlewood decomposition using Frobenius partitions. We also apply our approach to self-conjugate partitions and doubled distinct partitions, and give new characterizations of their $t$-cores and $t$-quotients.</description>

      <title>Saturation of 0-1 Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 0-1 matrix $M$ contains a 0-1 matrix $P$ if $M$ has a submatrix $P'$ which can be turned into $P$ by changing some of the ones to zeroes. Matrix $M$ is $P$-saturated if $M$ does not contain $P$, but any matrix $M'$ derived from $M$ by changing a zero to a one must contain $P$. The saturation function $sat(n,P)$ is defined as the minimum number of ones of an $n \times n$ $P$-saturated 0-1 matrix. Fulek and Keszegh showed that each pattern $P$ has $sat(n,P) = O(1)$ or $sat(n,P) = \Theta(n)$. This leads to the natural problem of classifying forbidden 0-1 matrices according to whether they have linear or bounded saturation functions. Some progress has been made on this problem: multiple infinite families of matrices with bounded saturation function and other families with linear saturation function have been identified. We answer this question for all patterns with at most four ones, as well as several specific patterns with more ones, including multiple new infinite families. We also consider the effects of certain matrix operations, including the Kronecker product and insertion of empty rows and columns. Additionally, we consider the simpler case of fixing one dimension, extending results of (Fulek and Keszegh, 2021) and (Berendsohn, 2021). We also generalize some results to $d$-dimensional saturation.</description>

      <title>Some exact values of the inducibility and statistics constants for hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two types of problems: maximising, over subsets $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, the density of $d$-subcubes $C$ in the $n$-hypercube graph that span a subgraph such that $S\cap C$ is i) isomorphic to the given configuration $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^d$ (the inducibility problem), or ii) has the given size $s$ (the statistics problem). Using flag algebras, we determine the limit of this density as $n\to\infty$ for 5 new configurations $H\subseteq\{0,1\}^3$ and for 3 new pairs $(d,s)$, namely for $(3,2)$, $(4,2)$ and $(4,4)$. Interestingly, the lower bounds in the last three cases come from blowups of small Hamming codes.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the planar Turan number of double star S_{3,5}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph H, the planar Turan number of H, denoted by ex_P(n, H), is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex H-free planar graph. Ghosh, Gyori, Paulos and Xiao initiated the topic of the planar Turan number for double stars. A (k,l)-star, denoted by S_{k,l}, is the graph obtained from an edge uv, and joining end vertices with k and l vertices, respectively. However, the exact value of ex_P(n, S_{3,5}) remains unknown. Building upon this research, we further investigate the problem. A k-l edge refers to an edge whose endpoints have degrees k and l, respectively. In this paper, we establish an upper bound for the planar Turan number of a graph G that does not contain the double star S_{3,5} or any 6-6 edges, which is 23n/8 - 3 for all n &gt;= 2.</description>

      <title>On graphs without cycles of length 1 modulo 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burr and Erd\H{o}s conjectured in 1976 that for every two integers $k&gt;\ell\geqslant 0$ satisfying that $k\mathbb{Z}+\ell$ contains an even integer, an $n$-vertex graph containing no cycles of length $\ell$ modulo $k$ can contain at most a linear number of edges on $n$. Bollob\'{a}s confirmed this conjecture in 1977 and then Erd\H{o}s proposed the problem of determining the exact value of the maximum number of edges in such a graph. For the above $k$ and $\ell$, define $c_{\ell,k}$ to be the least constant such that every $n$-vertex graph with at least $c_{\ell,k}\cdot n$ edges contains a cycle of length $\ell$ modulo $k$. The precise (or asymptotic) values of $c_{\ell,k}$ are known for very few pairs $\ell$ and $k$. In this paper, we precisely determine the maximum number of edges in a graph containing no cycles of length 1 modulo 3. In particular, we show that every $n$-vertex graph with at least $\frac{5}{3}(n-1)$ edges contains a cycle of length 1 modulo 3, unless $9|(n-1)$ and each block of the graph is a Petersen graph. As a corollary, we obtain that $c_{1,3}=\frac{5}{3}$. This is the last remaining class modulo $k$ for $1\leqslant k\leqslant 4$.</description>

      <title>Additive growth amongst images of linearly independent analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a set of $n$ real analytic functions with linearly independent derivatives restricted to a compact interval $I$. We show that for any finite set $A \subset I$, there is a function $f \in \mathcal{F}$ that satisfies
  $$|2^{n-1}f(A)-(2^{n-1}-1)f(A)|\gg_{\mathcal{F},I} |A|^{\phi(n)},$$ where $\phi:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies the recursive formula
  $$\phi(1)=1, \quad \phi(n)=1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{\phi(n-1)}} \quad \text{for } n\geq 2.$$ The above result allows us to prove the bound
  $$|2^nf(A-A)-(2^n-1)f(A-A)| \gg_{f,n,I} |A|^{1+\phi(n)}$$ where $f$ is an analytic function for which any $n$ distinct non-trivial discrete derivatives of $f'$ are linearly independent. This condition is satisfied, for instance, by any polynomial function of degree $m \geq n+1$. We also check this condition for the function $\arctan(e^x)$ with $n=3$, allowing us to improve upon a recent bound on the additive growth of the set of angles in a Cartesian product due to Roche-Newton.</description>

      <title>Positivity of generalized cluster scattering diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of combinatorial objects, named tight gradings, which are certain nonnegative integer-valued functions on maximal Dyck paths. Using tight gradings, we derive a manifestly positive formula for any wall-function in a rank-2 generalized cluster scattering diagram. We further prove that any consistent rank-2 scattering diagram is positive with respect to the coefficients of initial wall-functions. Moreover, our formula yields explicit expressions for relative Gromov-Witten invariants on weighted projective planes and the Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of framed stable representations on complete bipartite quivers. Finally, by leveraging the rank-2 positivity, we show that any higher-rank generalized cluster scattering diagram has positive wall-functions, which leads to a proof of the positivity of the Laurent phenomenon and the strong positivity of Chekhov-Shapiro's generalized cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latroids were introduced by Vertigan, who associated a latroid to a linear block code and showed that its Tutte polynomial determines the weight enumerator of the code. We associate a latroid to a code over a ring or a field endowed with a general support function, and show that the generalized weights of the code can be recovered from the associated latroid. This provides a uniform framework for studying generalized weights of linear block codes, linear codes over a ring, rank-metric and sum-rank metric codes. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the latroid determines the weight distribution of the code.</description>

Abstract: In 2017, Ehrenborg, Govindaiah, Park, and Readdy defined the van der Waerden complex ${\tt vdW}(n,k)$ to be the simplicial complex whose facets correspond to all the arithmetic sequences on the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ of a fixed length $k$. To complement a classification of the Cohen--Macaulay van der Waerden complexes obtained by Hooper and Van Tuyl in 2019, a classification of van der Waerden complexes with linear resolution is presented. Furthermore, we show that the Stanley--Reisner ring of a Cohen--Macaulay van der Waerden complex is level.</description>

      <title>Lawvere's fourth open problem: Levels in the topos of symmetric simplicial sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the topos of simplicial sets, it makes sense to ask the following question about a given natural number $n$: what is the minimum value $m$ such that $n$-skeletality implies $m$-coskeletality? This is an instance of the Aufhebung relation in the sense of Lawvere, who introduced this notion for an arbitrary Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ in place of $\mathbf{sSet}$, and levels/essential subtopoi in place of dimensions.
  We compute this Aufhebung relation for the topos of symmetric simplicial sets. In particular, we show that it is given by $2l-1$ for the level labelled by $l\geq 3$, which coincides with the previously known case of simplicial sets. This result provides a solution to the fourth of the seven open problems in topos theory posed by Lawvere in 2009.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. This problem is known as Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Path Problem (POHPP). Here, we study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary Hamiltonian Path problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$. We show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4. We complement this result by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2. Furthermore, we show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for graphs of clique cover number 2 and $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for some distance-to-$\mathcal{G}$ parameters, including distance to path and distance to clique. In addition, we present $\mathsf{XP}$ and $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for parameters such as distance to block and feedback edge set number.</description>

      <title>Simple homotopy of flag simplicial complexes and contractible contractions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his work on molecular spaces, Ivashchenko introduced the notion of an $\mathfrak{I}$-contractible transformation on a graph $G$, a family of addition/deletion operations on its vertices and edges. Chen, Yau, and Yeh used these operations to define the $\mathfrak{I}$-homotopy type of a graph, and showed that $\mathfrak{I}$-contractible transformations preserve the simple homotopy type of $C(G)$, the clique complex of $G$. In other work, Boulet, Fieux, and Jouve introduced the notion of $s$-homotopy of graphs to characterize the simple homotopy type of a flag simplicial complex. They proved that $s$-homotopy preserves $\mathfrak{I}$-homotopy, and asked whether the converse holds. In this note, we answer their question in the affirmative, concluding that graphs $G$ and $H$ are $\mathfrak{I}$-homotopy equivalent if and only if $C(G)$ and $C(H)$ are simple homotopy equivalent. We also show that a finite graph $G$ is $\mathfrak{I}$-contractible if and only if $C(G)$ is contractible, which answers a question posed by the first author, Espinoza, Fr\'ias-Armenta, and Hern\'andez. We use these ideas to give a characterization of simple homotopy for arbitrary simplicial complexes in terms of links of vertices.</description>

Abstract: The Steklov eigenvalue problem was introduced over a century ago, and its discrete form attracted interest recently. Let $D$ and $\delta \Omega$ be the maximum vertex degree and the set of vertices of degree one in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Let $\lambda_2$ be the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue of $(\mathcal{G}, \delta \Omega)$. In this paper, using the circle packing theorem and conformal mapping, we first show that $\lambda_2 \leq 8D / |\delta \Omega|$ for planar graphs. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of Kokarev's bound [Variational aspects of Laplace eigenvalues on Riemannian surfaces, Adv. Math. (2014)], that is, $\lambda_2 &lt; 8\pi / |\partial \Omega|$ for compact surfaces with boundary of genus $0$. Let $B$ and $L$ be the maximum block size and the diameter of a block graph $\mathcal{G}$ repsectively. Secondly, we prove that $\lambda_2 \leq B^2 (D-1)/ |\delta \Omega|$ and $\lambda_2 \leq (2L + (L-2)(B-2))/L^2$ for block graphs, which extend the results on trees by He and Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on trees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)]. In the end, for trees with fixed leaf number and maximum degree, candidates that achieve the maximum first Steklov eigenvalue are given.</description>

      <title>Matroids and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1981, Adriano Garsia and Steve Milne found the first bijective proof of the celebrated Rogers-Ramanujan identities. To achieve this feat, they invented a versatile tool that they called the Involution Principle. In this note we revisit this useful principle from a very general perspective, independent of its application to specific combinatorial identities, and will explore its complexity.</description>

      <title>On Strongly Regular Graphs and the Friendship Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative proof of the celebrated friendship theorem, originally established by Erd\H{o}s, R\'{e}nyi, and S\'{o}s (1966). The proof relies on a closed-form expression for the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of strongly regular graphs, recently derived by the author. Additionally, the paper considers some known extensions of the theorem, offering discussions that provide insights into the friendship theorem, one of its extensions, and the proposed proof. Leveraging the closed-form expression for the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of strongly regular graphs, the paper further establishes new necessary conditions for a strongly regular graph to be a spanning or induced subgraph of another strongly regular graph. In the case of induced subgraphs, the analysis also incorporates a property of graph energies. Some of these results are extended to regular graphs and their subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Matroids and the space of torus-invariant subvarieties of the Grassmannian with given homology class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}(d,n)$ be the complex Grassmannian of affine $d$-planes in $n$-space. We study the problem of characterizing the set of algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{G}(d,n)$ invariant under the action of the maximal torus $T$ and having given homology class $\lambda$. We give a complete answer for the case where $\lambda$ is the class of a $T$-orbit, and partial results for other cases, using techniques inspired by matroid theory. This problem has applications to the computation of the Euler-Chow series for Grassmannians of projective lines: we calculate the series for 3-cycles in $\mathbb{G}(2,4)$ and carry out partial calculations for $\mathbb{G}(2,5)$.</description>

      <title>Linear patterns of prime elements in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a number field analogue of the Green--Tao--Ziegler theorem on simultaneous prime values of degree 1 polynomials whose linear parts are pairwise linearly independent. This can be used to prove a Hasse principle result for certain fibrations $X\to \mathbb{P}^1$ over a number field $K$ extending a result of Harpaz--Skorobogatov--Wittenberg which was only available over $\mathbb Q $. The main technical content is the proof that the von Mangoldt function $\Lambda _K$ of a number field $K$ is well approximated by its Cramer/Siegel models in the Gowers norm sense. Via the inverse theory of the Gowers norm, this is achieved by showing that the difference of $\Lambda _K$ and its model is asymptotically orthogonal to nilsequences. To prove the asymptotic orthogonality, we use Mitsui's Prime Element Theorem as the base case and proceed by upgrading Green--Tao's type I/II sum computation to the general number field. Other applications of our results include the negative resolution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem over all number rings by Koymans--Pagano.</description>

      <title>Projective rigidity of point-line configurations in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Halin's end-degree Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new instances of \emph{Halin's end degree conjecture} (\emph{HC}) within $\mathrm{ZFC}$. In particular, we prove that there is a proper class of cardinals $\kappa$ for which Halin's end-degree conjecture holds. This answers two questions posed by Geschke, Kurkofka, Melcher and Pitz in 2023. Furthermore, we comment on the relationship between \emph{HC} and the \emph{Singular Cardinal Hypothesis}, deriving consistency strength from failures of the former. We verify that Halin's conjecture fails on finite intervals of successors of singular cardinals in Meremovich's model, this is a new independence result on \emph{HC}.</description>

      <title>Fast exact recovery of noisy matrix from few entries: the infinity norm approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix recovery (completion) problem, a central problem in data science and theoretical computer science, is to recover a matrix $A$ from a relatively small sample of entries.
  While such a task is impossible in general, it has been shown that one can recover $A$ exactly in polynomial time, with high probability, from a random subset of entries, under three (basic and necessary) assumptions: (1) the rank of $A$ is very small compared to its dimensions (low rank), (2) $A$ has delocalized singular vectors (incoherence), and (3) the sample size is sufficiently large.
  There are many different algorithms for the task, including convex optimization by Candes, Tao and Recht (2009), alternating projection by Hardt and Wooters (2014) and low rank approximation with gradient descent by Keshavan, Montanari and Oh (2009, 2010).
  In applications, it is more realistic to assume that data is noisy. In this case, these approaches provide an approximate recovery with small root mean square error. However, it is hard to transform such an approximate recovery to an exact one.
  Recently, results by Abbe et al. (2017) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) concerning approximation in the infinity norm showed that we can achieve exact recovery even in the noisy case, given that the ground matrix has bounded precision. Beyond the three basic assumptions above, they required either the condition number of $A$ is small (Abbe et al.) or the gap between consecutive singular values is large (Bhardwaj et al.).
  In this paper, we remove these extra spectral assumptions. As a result, we obtain a simple algorithm for exact recovery in the noisy case, under only the three basic assumptions. This is the first such algorithm. To analyse this algorithm, we introduce a contour integration argument which is totally different from all previous methods and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>
