      <title>Stochastic Gradient-Descent Calibration of Pyragas Delayed-Feedback Control for Chaos Suppression in the Sprott Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates chaos control in the Sprott circuit, a minimal electronic system exhibiting complex nonlinear dynamics. Using the third-order nonlinear differential equation from Kaveh Merat paper, we model the circuit and implement delayed feedback control to suppress chaos. Experimental voltage data were extracted from published figures via WebPlotDigitizer. Then we explore two calibration techniques: Minimizing sum of squared errors (SSE), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with finite differences. Joint optimization of control parameters and the variable resistor achieves the best alignment with experimental data, accurately capturing phase and amplitude. SGD outperforms grid search in phase synchronization, though amplitude discrepancies persist due to model simplifications. The trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is analyzed, revealing scalability challenges in chaotic system calibration. Phase space analysis validates the model ability to replicate the chaotic attractor geometry, despite minor deviations. Overall, Stochastic Gradient Descent based calibration of chaotic nonlinear systems shows significant potential for advancing mathematical modeling and electrical engineering.</description>

      <title>The symbolic partition with generalized Koopman analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic dynamics serves as a crucial tool in the study of chaotic systems, prompting extensive research into various methods for symbolic partitioning. The limitations of these methods are heuristic and empirical for the partition the multivariate chaotic state space. Notably, the use of operator theory in partitioning the multivariable chaotic series into precise symbolic cells has been underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel symbolic partition method, referred to as Koopman Analysis(KA) method, exploiting Koopman operator theory to address the symbolic partition, especially multivariate chaotic time series. We map the chaotic time series into the basis functions to obtain the approximate representation of the Koopman operator.Then we transpose the Koopman approximate matrix and subsequently perform spectral decomposition to obtain the Koopman left eigenfunctions. We apply KA method to one-dimensional unimodal chaotic map to obtain Koopman left eigenfunctions. Then we find some particular eigenfunctions whose eigenvalues are zero, some of which can be used to identify the symbolic boundary of region composed of chaotic series in that the oscillation coincides with the subregion where the theoretical symbolic boundary is located. We refer to the function as the Valid Left Eigenfunction with Zero(VLEZ). Based on the number of oscillations, we further classify VLEZ into two categories. Then, we modify the KA method applicable to chaotic localized subregion and further propose the Generalized Koopman Analysis (GKA) method. The KA method can be also applied to the multimodal maps, multivariate chaotic maps and hyperchaotic maps and their noisy version. The current work can be well further expand to higher dimensional and more complex time series due to its interpretability and availability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>

Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Functional Roles of Nonlinearity in Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting, speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory. Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity, bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Driven Intermittency and Extreme Events in Turbulent Scalar Transport with a Mean Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>
