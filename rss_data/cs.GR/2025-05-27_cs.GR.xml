      <title>A Novel Benchmark and Dataset for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting with Gaussian Point Cloud Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, immersive media and autonomous driving applications have significantly advanced through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which offers high-fidelity rendering and computational efficiency. Despite these advantages, 3DGS as a display-oriented representation requires substantial storage due to its numerous Gaussian attributes. Current compression methods have shown promising results but typically neglect the compression of Gaussian spatial positions, creating unnecessary bitstream overhead. We conceptualize Gaussian primitives as point clouds and propose leveraging point cloud compression techniques for more effective storage. AI-based point cloud compression demonstrates superior performance and faster inference compared to MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC). However, direct application of existing models to Gaussian compression may yield suboptimal results, as Gaussian point clouds tend to exhibit globally sparse yet locally dense geometric distributions that differ from conventional point cloud characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce GausPcgc for Gaussian point cloud geometry compression along with a specialized training dataset GausPcc-1K. Our work pioneers the integration of AI-based point cloud compression into Gaussian compression pipelines, achieving superior compression ratios. The framework complements existing Gaussian compression methods while delivering significant performance improvements. All code, data, and pre-trained models will be publicly released to facilitate further research advances in this field.</description>

      <title>Efficient Differentiable Hardware Rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works demonstrate the advantages of hardware rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in forward-pass rendering through fast GPU-optimized graphics and fixed memory footprint. However, extending these benefits to backward-pass gradient computation remains challenging due to graphics pipeline constraints. We present a differentiable hardware rasterizer for 3DGS that overcomes the memory and performance limitations of tile-based software rasterization. Our solution employs programmable blending for per-pixel gradient computation combined with a hybrid gradient reduction strategy (quad-level + subgroup) in fragment shaders, achieving over 10x faster backward rasterization versus naive atomic operations and 3x speedup over the canonical tile-based rasterizer. Systematic evaluation reveals 16-bit render targets (float16 and unorm16) as the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving higher gradient accuracy among mixed-precision rendering formats with execution speeds second only to unorm8, while float32 texture incurs severe forward pass performance degradation due to suboptimal hardware optimizations. Our method with float16 formats demonstrates 3.07x acceleration in full pipeline execution (forward + backward passes) on RTX4080 GPUs with the MipNeRF dataset, outperforming the baseline tile-based renderer while preserving hardware rasterization's memory efficiency advantages -- incurring merely 2.67% of the memory overhead required for splat sorting operations. This work presents a unified differentiable hardware rasterization method that simultaneously optimizes runtime and memory usage for 3DGS, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices with limited memory capacity.</description>

      <title>CageNet: A Meta-Framework for Learning on Wild Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning on triangle meshes has recently proven to be instrumental to a myriad of tasks, from shape classification, to segmentation, to deformation and animation, to mention just a few. While some of these applications are tackled through neural network architectures which are tailored to the application at hand, many others use generic frameworks for triangle meshes where the only customization required is the modification of the input features and the loss function. Our goal in this paper is to broaden the applicability of these generic frameworks to "wild", i.e. meshes in-the-wild which often have multiple components, non-manifold elements, disrupted connectivity, or a combination of these. We propose a configurable meta-framework based on the concept of caged geometry: Given a mesh, a cage is a single component manifold triangle mesh that envelopes it closely. Generalized barycentric coordinates map between functions on the cage, and functions on the mesh, allowing us to learn and test on a variety of data, in different applications. We demonstrate this concept by learning segmentation and skinning weights on difficult data, achieving better performance to state of the art techniques on wild meshes.</description>

      <title>DiffHairCard: Auto Hair Card Extraction with Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hair cards remain a widely used representation for hair modeling in real-time applications, offering a practical trade-off between visual fidelity, memory usage, and performance. However, generating high-quality hair card models remains a challenging and labor-intensive task. This work presents an automated pipeline for converting strand-based hair models into hair card models with a limited number of cards and textures while preserving the hairstyle appearance. Our key idea is a novel differentiable representation where each strand is encoded as a projected 2D spline in the texture space, which enables efficient optimization with differentiable rendering and structured results respecting the hair geometry. Based on this representation, we develop a novel algorithm pipeline, where we first cluster hair strands into initial hair cards and project the strands into the texture space. We then conduct a two-stage optimization where our first stage optimizes the texture and geometry of each hair card separately, and after texture reduction, our second stage conducts joint optimization of all the cards for fine-tuning. Put together, our method is evaluated on a wide range of hairstyles, including straight, wavy, curly, and coily hairs. To better capture the appearance of short or coily hair, we additionally support hair cap and cross-card. Furthermore, our framework supports seamless LoD transitions via texture sharing, balancing texture memory efficiency and visual quality.</description>

      <title>SRDiffusion: Accelerate Video Diffusion Inference via Sketching-Rendering Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging the diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, models like Sora, CogVideoX and Wan have achieved remarkable progress in text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing tasks. Despite these advances, diffusion-based video generation remains computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos. Prior work accelerates its inference by skipping computation, usually at the cost of severe quality degradation. In this paper, we propose SRDiffusion, a novel framework that leverages collaboration between large and small models to reduce inference cost. The large model handles high-noise steps to ensure semantic and motion fidelity (Sketching), while the smaller model refines visual details in low-noise steps (Rendering). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, over 3$\times$ speedup for Wan with nearly no quality loss for VBench, and 2$\times$ speedup for CogVideoX. Our method is introduced as a new direction orthogonal to existing acceleration strategies, offering a practical solution for scalable video generation.</description>

      <title>A Fluorescent Material Model for Non-Spectral Editing &amp; Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescent materials are characterized by a spectral reradiation toward longer wavelengths. Recent work [Fichet et al. 2024] has shown that the rendering of fluorescence in a non-spectral engine is possible through the use of appropriate reduced reradiation matrices. But the approach has limited expressivity, as it requires the storage of one reduced matrix per fluorescent material, and only works with measured fluorescent assets.
  In this work, we introduce an analytical approach to the editing and rendering of fluorescence in a non-spectral engine. It is based on a decomposition of the reduced reradiation matrix, and an analytically-integrable Gaussian-based model of the fluorescent component. The model reproduces the appearance of fluorescent materials accurately, especially with the addition of a UV basis. Most importantly, it grants variations of fluorescent material parameters in real-time, either for the editing of fluorescent materials, or for the dynamic spatial variation of fluorescence properties across object surfaces. A simplified one-Gaussian fluorescence model even allows for the artist-friendly creation of plausible fluorescent materials from scratch, requiring only a few reflectance colors as input.</description>

      <title>CAD-Coder: Text-to-CAD Generation with Chain-of-Thought and Geometric Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce CAD-Coder, a novel framework that reformulates text-to-CAD as the generation of CadQuery scripts - a Python-based, parametric CAD language. This representation enables direct geometric validation, a richer modeling vocabulary, and seamless integration with existing LLMs. To further enhance code validity and geometric fidelity, we propose a two-stage learning pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on paired text-CadQuery data, and (2) reinforcement learning with Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by a CAD-specific reward comprising both a geometric reward (Chamfer Distance) and a format reward. We also introduce a chain-of-thought (CoT) planning process to improve model reasoning, and construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 110K text-CadQuery-3D model triplets and 1.5K CoT samples via an automated pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-Coder enables LLMs to generate diverse, valid, and complex CAD models directly from natural language, advancing the state of the art of text-to-CAD generation and geometric reasoning.</description>

      <title>MAMM: Motion Control via Metric-Aligning Motion Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for controlling a motion sequence using an arbitrary temporal control sequence using temporal alignment. Temporal alignment of motion has gained significant attention owing to its applications in motion control and retargeting. Traditional methods rely on either learned or hand-craft cross-domain mappings between frames in the original and control domains, which often require large, paired, or annotated datasets and time-consuming training. Our approach, named Metric-Aligning Motion Matching, achieves alignment by solely considering within-domain distances. It computes distances among patches in each domain and seeks a matching that optimally aligns the two within-domain distances. This framework allows for the alignment of a motion sequence to various types of control sequences, including sketches, labels, audio, and another motion sequence, all without the need for manually defined mappings or training with annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through applications in efficient motion control, showcasing its potential in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Emotion Knowledge Enhancement for Vision Large Language Models: A Self-Verification Approach for High-Quality Emotion Instruction Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial emotion perception in the vision large language model (VLLM) is crucial for achieving natural human-machine interaction. However, creating high-quality annotations for both coarse- and fine-grained facial emotion analysis demands costly expertise. The lack of such high-quality instruction data limits the performance of VLLMs in facial emotion perception. To address this, we propose a self-verification approach with emotion knowledge enhancement (SEKE), which generates high-quality instruction data for multi-grained emotion analysis cost-effectively using closed-source VLLM. This approach integrates prior human knowledge to VLLM inference, guided by the inherent correlations between three grained levels of emotion descriptions, i.e., discrete expression, valence-arousal, and action unit, to reliably generate comprehensive annotations. A self-verification strategy with Uncertainty-Aware Monte Carlo sampling (SV-UAMC) is further embedded to efficiently extract more accurate VLLM predictions, further improving annotation reliability. Consequently, we construct a facial emotion instruction dataset (FEID) containing three comprehensive descriptions, which provides coarse- and fine-grained emotional information for effective model training. Additionally, we introduce a facial emotion analysis benchmark (FEAB) to measure the VLLM's corresponding ability. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three downstream facial emotion analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>MaskedManipulator: Versatile Whole-Body Control for Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans interact with their world while leveraging precise full-body control to achieve versatile goals. This versatility allows them to solve long-horizon, underspecified problems, such as placing a cup in a sink, by seamlessly sequencing actions like approaching the cup, grasping, transporting it, and finally placing it in the sink. Such goal-driven control can enable new procedural tools for animation systems, enabling users to define partial objectives while the system naturally ``fills in'' the intermediate motions. However, while current methods for whole-body dexterous manipulation in physics-based animation achieve success in specific interaction tasks, they typically employ control paradigms (e.g., detailed kinematic motion tracking, continuous object trajectory following, or direct VR teleoperation) that offer limited versatility for high-level goal specification across the entire coupled human-object system. To bridge this gap, we present MaskedManipulator, a unified and generative policy developed through a two-stage learning approach. First, our system trains a tracking controller to physically reconstruct complex human-object interactions from large-scale human mocap datasets. This tracking controller is then distilled into MaskedManipulator, which provides users with intuitive control over both the character's body and the manipulated object. As a result, MaskedManipulator enables users to specify complex loco-manipulation tasks through intuitive high-level objectives (e.g., target object poses, key character stances), and MaskedManipulator then synthesizes the necessary full-body actions for a physically simulated humanoid to achieve these goals, paving the way for more interactive and life-like virtual characters.</description>

      <title>From Single Images to Motion Policies via Video-Generation Environment Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots typically need to construct representations of their surroundings and adapt their motions to the geometry of their environment. Here, we tackle the problem of constructing a policy model for collision-free motion generation, consistent with the environment, from a single input RGB image. Extracting 3D structures from a single image often involves monocular depth estimation. Developments in depth estimation have given rise to large pre-trained models such as DepthAnything. However, using outputs of these models for downstream motion generation is challenging due to frustum-shaped errors that arise. Instead, we propose a framework known as Video-Generation Environment Representation (VGER), which leverages the advances of large-scale video generation models to generate a moving camera video conditioned on the input image. Frames of this video, which form a multiview dataset, are then input into a pre-trained 3D foundation model to produce a dense point cloud. We then introduce a multi-scale noise approach to train an implicit representation of the environment structure and build a motion generation model that complies with the geometry of the representation. We extensively evaluate VGER over a diverse set of indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate its ability to produce smooth motions that account for the captured geometry of a scene, all from a single RGB input image.</description>

      <title>Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</description>

      <title>In-Context Brush: Zero-shot Customized Subject Insertion with Context-Aware Latent Space Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enhanced multimodal-guided visual generation, enabling customized subject insertion that seamlessly "brushes" user-specified objects into a given image guided by textual prompts. However, existing methods often struggle to insert customized subjects with high fidelity and align results with the user's intent through textual prompts. In this work, we propose "In-Context Brush", a zero-shot framework for customized subject insertion by reformulating the task within the paradigm of in-context learning. Without loss of generality, we formulate the object image and the textual prompts as cross-modal demonstrations, and the target image with the masked region as the query. The goal is to inpaint the target image with the subject aligning textual prompts without model tuning. Building upon a pretrained MMDiT-based inpainting network, we perform test-time enhancement via dual-level latent space manipulation: intra-head "latent feature shifting" within each attention head that dynamically shifts attention outputs to reflect the desired subject semantics and inter-head "attention reweighting" across different heads that amplifies prompt controllability through differential attention prioritization. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that our approach achieves superior identity preservation, text alignment, and image quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring dedicated training or additional data collection.</description>

Abstract: Collage and packing techniques are widely used to organize geometric shapes into cohesive visual representations, facilitating the representation of visual features holistically, as seen in image collages and word clouds. Traditional methods often rely on object-space optimization, requiring intricate geometric descriptors and energy functions to handle complex shapes. In this paper, we introduce a versatile image-space collage technique. Leveraging a differentiable renderer, our method effectively optimizes the object layout with image-space losses, bringing the benefit of fixed complexity and easy accommodation of various shapes. Applying a hierarchical resolution strategy in image space, our method efficiently optimizes the collage with fast convergence, large coarse steps first and then small precise steps. The diverse visual expressiveness of our approach is demonstrated through various examples. Experimental results show that our method achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

      <title>GenAnalysis: Joint Shape Analysis by Learning Man-Made Shape Generators with Deformation Regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00807</link>

Abstract: We present GenAnalysis, an implicit shape generation framework that allows joint analysis of man-made shapes, including shape matching and joint shape segmentation. The key idea is to enforce an as-affine-as-possible (AAAP) deformation between synthetic shapes of the implicit generator that are close to each other in the latent space, which we achieve by designing a regularization loss. It allows us to understand the shape variation of each shape in the context of neighboring shapes and also offers structure-preserving interpolations between the input shapes. We show how to extract these shape variations by recovering piecewise affine vector fields in the tangent space of each shape. These vector fields provide single-shape segmentation cues. We then derive shape correspondences by iteratively propagating AAAP deformations across a sequence of intermediate shapes. These correspondences are then used to aggregate single-shape segmentation cues into consistent segmentations. We conduct experiments on the ShapeNet dataset to show superior performance in shape matching and joint shape segmentation over previous methods.</description>

      <title>Pixels2Points: Fusing 2D and 3D Features for Facial Skin Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face registration deforms a template mesh to closely fit a 3D face scan, the quality of which commonly degrades in non-skin regions (e.g., hair, beard, accessories), because the optimized template-to-scan distance pulls the template mesh towards the noisy scan surface. Improving registration quality requires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh. Existing image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however perform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks, and they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while scan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In this work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from non-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts features from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and aggregates these features in 3D. These lifted 2D features are then fused with 3D geometric features extracted from the scan mesh, to then predict a segmentation mask directly on the scan mesh. We show that our segmentations improve the registration accuracy over pure 2D or 3D segmentation methods by 8.89% and 14.3%, respectively. Although trained only on synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real data.</description>

      <title>Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.

      <title>Polycubes via Dual Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study polycubes: orthogonal polyhedra with axis-aligned quadrilateral faces. We present a complete characterization of polycubes of any genus based on their dual structure: a collection of oriented loops which run in each of the axis directions and capture polycubes via their intersection patterns. A polycube loop structure uniquely corresponds to a polycube. We also describe all combinatorially different ways to add a loop to a loop structure while maintaining its validity. Similarly, we show how to identify loops that can be removed from a polycube loop structure without invalidating it. Our characterization gives rise to an iterative algorithm to construct provably valid polycube maps for a given input surface.</description>

      <title>DC-VSR: Spatially and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution with Video Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) video from a low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Lavender, a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method that boosts the performance of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) by leveraging state-of-the-art image generation models such as Stable Diffusion. Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks. By efficiently transferring the visual expertise of image generators with minimal supervision, Lavender offers a scalable solution for more accurate vision-language systems.

      <title>Mean-Shift Distillation for Diffusion Mode Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present mean-shift distillation, a novel diffusion distillation technique that provides a provably good proxy for the gradient of the diffusion output distribution. This is derived directly from mean-shift mode seeking on the distribution, and we show that its extrema are aligned with the modes. We further derive an efficient product distribution sampling procedure to evaluate the gradient. Our method is formulated as a drop-in replacement for score distillation sampling (SDS), requiring neither model retraining nor extensive modification of the sampling procedure. We show that it exhibits superior mode alignment as well as improved convergence in both synthetic and practical setups, yielding higher-fidelity results when applied to both text-to-image and text-to-3D applications with Stable Diffusion.</description>
