      <title>Does the financialization of agricultural commodities impact food security? An empirical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The financialization of agricultural commodities and its impact on food security has become an increasing concern. This study empirically investigates the role of financialization in global food markets and its policy implications for a stable and secure food system. Using panel data regression models, moderating effects models, and panel regression with a threshold variable, we analyze wheat, maize, and soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. We incorporate data on annual trading volume, open interest contracts, and their ratio. The sample consists of five developed countries (United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany) and seven developing countries (China, Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand), covering the period 2000 to 2021. The Human Development Index (HDI) serves as a threshold variable to differentiate the impact across countries. Our findings indicate that the financialization of agricultural commodities has negatively affected global food security, with wheat and soybean showing a greater adverse impact than maize. The effects are more pronounced in developing countries. Additionally, we find that monetary policy has the potential to mitigate these negative effects. These results provide insights for policymakers to design strategies that ensure a secure and accessible global food supply.</description>

      <title>Rising Marginal Costs, Rising Prices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence on the relationship between demand shocks and price changes, conditional on returns to scale. We find that in industries with decreasing returns to scale, demand increases (which raise costs) correspond to price increases. Whereas, in industries with increasing returns to scale, demand increases (which lower costs) correspond to stable prices. We interpret the results with a theory of imperfect competition and returns to scale. For prices to remain stable following a cost decrease, markups necessarily rise. For prices to increase as cost increases, it is not necessary for markups to change but does not preclude their role. From a macroeconomic perspective, our results imply that inflation dynamics and the effectiveness of monetary policy depend on market structures.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and the Model-theoretic Foundations of Controversies in Economic Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature and an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project. From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets' before the financial crisis. We thus identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The frst focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called "Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu"-Theorems. The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in what could be called "The Dynamical Systems approach to Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics", and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations. We conclude by giving an outlook in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising. The focus lies on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and we discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed from the perspective of the progressive political left.</description>

      <title>Compounding Effect of Harsh Climate and Societal Disruptions on Food Prices in Early Modern Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex interplay between famine, warfare, and climate constitutes a multifaceted and context-dependent relationship that has profoundly influenced human history, particularly in early modern Europe. This study advances the literature on climate-economy interactions by leveraging multi-scale statistical techniques to quantify the compounded effects of climate variability and socio-political factors on food prices, offering novel model-based insights into the historical dynamics of climate and economic systems. Using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), we investigate the influence of temperature fluctuations and drought severity on food prices across 14 European cities from 1565 to 1785. Our findings confirm a persistent negative relationship between temperature and food prices over the long term, while the relationship between drought severity and price dynamics appears positive yet inconsistent. Extending our analysis to higher-frequency patterns, we demonstrate that cold anomalies are strongly associated with food price that caused large-scale famines of the 1590s and 1690s. Likewise, we show that the severe and consecutive droughts of 1634 to 1636, coinciding with the Thirty Years' War, significantly amplified food price volatility, illustrating how climatic shocks can compound socio-economic and political crises. Furthermore, we identify years characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of extreme cold and drought as periods of heightened price instability, underscoring the compounded impact of concurrent climatic stressors on food prices during the early modern period.</description>

      <title>Words or Numbers? How Framing Uncertainties Affects Risk Assessment and Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The communication of uncertainties needs to be as precise as possible to enable the receiver of risk-messages to adapt their behavior appropriately. However, the communication of uncertainties comes with its own set of challenges as most senders prefer to communicate uncertainty through verbal probability phrases (e.g., likely) - a communication form characterized by its ambiguity and (framed) directionality. While it is well known that receivers often do not translate such phrases into the numerical probability intended by the sender, it is less clear how this discrepancy influences subsequent behavioral actions. Thus, the role of verbal versus numerical communication of uncertainty warrants additional attention to investigate two critical questions: 1) whether differences in decision-making under uncertainty arise between these communication forms, and 2) whether such differences persist even when verbal phrases are translated accurately into the intended numerical meaning. By implementing a laboratory experiment, we show that individuals value uncertain options with medium to high likelihoods significantly lower when uncertainty is communicated verbally rather than numerically. This effect may lead to less rational decisions under verbal communication, particularly at high likelihoods. Those results remain consistent even if individuals translate verbal uncertainty correctly into the associate numerical uncertainty, implying that a biased behavioral response is not only induced by mistranslations. Instead, ambiguity about the exact meaning of a verbal phrase interferes with decision-making even beyond potential mistranslations. These findings tie in with previous research on ambiguity aversion, which has predominantly operationalized ambiguity through numerical ranges rather than verbal phrases.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Damped Harmonic Oscillator in DSGE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper integrates the damped harmonic oscillator into DSGE models to better capture delayed economic adjustments. By introducing a damping coefficient, I model economic recoveries as under-damped, critically damped, or over-damped processes. Numerical simulations illustrate how different damping levels affect recovery speed and stability. This approach enhances DSGE models' realism, offering insights into historical economic crises and improving macroeconomic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Median Voter Theorem: A New Framework for Ideological Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the limitations of the Median Voter Theorem and introduces a novel framework to analyze the optimal economic ideological positions of political parties. By incorporating Nash equilibrium, we examine the mechanisms and elasticity of ideal deviation costs, voter distribution, and policy feasibility. Our findings show that an increase in a party's ideal deviation cost shifts its optimal ideological position closer to its ideal point. Additionally, if a voter distribution can be expressed as a positive linear combination of two other distributions, its equilibrium point must lie within the interval defined by the equilibrium points of the latter two. We also find that decreasing feasibility costs incentivize governments, regardless of political orientation, to increase fiscal expenditures (e.g., welfare) and reduce fiscal revenues (e.g., taxes). This dynamic highlights the fiscal pressures commonly faced by democratic nations under globalization. Moreover, we demonstrate that even with uncertain voter distributions, parties can identify optimal ideological positions to maximize their utility. Lastly, we explain why the proposed framework cannot be applied to community ideologies due to their fundamentally different nature. This study provides new theoretical insights into political strategies and establishes a foundation for future empirical research.</description>

      <title>Banning short-haul flights and investing in high-speed railways for a sustainable future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance mobility sustainability, high-speed railways (HSR) decarbonization effect, and bans for short-haul flights are debated in Europe. Yet, holistic environmental assessments on these topics are scarce. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the Paris-Bordeaux transportation options in France: HSR, plane, coach, personal car, and carpooling. The overall ranking on four environmental indicators, from best to worst, is as follows: coach, HSR, carpooling, private car, and plane. Scenario analyses showed that increasing train occupancy decreases the environmental impact of the mode (-12%), while decreasing speed does not. Moreover, worldwide carbon footprints of electric HSR modes range 30-120 gCO2eq per passenger-kilometer traveled. Finally, a consequential LCA highlighted carbon paybacks of the HSR project. Under a business-as-usual trip substitution scenario, the HSR gets net-zero 60 years after construction. With a short-haul flight ban, it occurs after 10 years. This advocates for generalizing short-haul flight bans and investing in HSR infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Robust valuation and optimal harvesting of forestry resources in the presence of catastrophe risk and parameter uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine forest lease value and optimal harvesting strategies under model parameter uncertainty within stochastic bio-economic models that account for catastrophe risk. Catastrophic events are modeled as a Poisson point process, with a two-factor stochastic convenience yield model capturing the lumber spot price dynamics. Using lumber futures and US wildfire data, we estimate model parameters through a Kalman filter and maximum likelihood estimation and define the model parameter uncertainty set as the 95% confidence region. We numerically determine the forest lease value under catastrophe risk and parameter uncertainty using reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and establish conservative and optimistic bounds for lease values and optimal stopping boundaries for harvesting, facilitating Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical experiments further explore how parameter uncertainty, catastrophe intensity, and carbon sequestration impact the lease valuation and harvesting decision. In particular, we explore the costs arising from this form of uncertainty in the form of a reduction of the lease value. These are implicit costs that can be attributed to climate risk and will be emphasized through the importance of forestry resources in the energy transition process. We conclude that in the presence of parameter uncertainty, it is better to lean toward a conservative strategy reflecting, to some extent, the worst case than being overly optimistic. Our results also highlight the critical role of convenience yield in determining optimal harvesting strategies.</description>

      <title>Managing Geological Uncertainty in Critical Mineral Supply Chains: A POMDP Approach with Application to U.S. Lithium Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world is entering an unprecedented period of critical mineral demand, driven by the global transition to renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles. This transition presents unique challenges in mineral resource development, particularly due to geological uncertainty-a key characteristic that traditional supply chain optimization approaches do not adequately address. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that optimizes critical mineral sourcing decisions while explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of geological uncertainty. Through a case study of the U.S. lithium supply chain, we demonstrate that POMDP-based policies achieve superior outcomes compared to traditional approaches, especially when initial reserve estimates are imperfect. Our framework provides quantitative insights for balancing domestic resource development with international supply diversification, offering policymakers a systematic approach to strategic decision-making in critical mineral supply chains.</description>

      <title>A Principal-Agent Model for Optimal Incentives in Renewable Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal regulation of energy production in alignment with the long-term goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We analyze the optimal regulatory incentives to foster the development of non-emissive electricity generation when the demand for power is met either by a single firm or by two interacting agents. The regulator aims to encourage green investments to limit carbon emissions while simultaneously reducing the intermittency of total energy production. We find that the regulator can achieve a higher certainty equivalent by regulating two interacting firms, each investing in one technology, rather than a single firm managing both technologies. This higher value is achieved thanks to a greater degree of freedom in the incentive mechanisms, which involve cross-subsidies between firms. Moreover, we find that it is optimal to compensate firms for shutting down their emissive production assets. We provide closed-form expressions of the second-best contracts and show that they take a rebate form, involving time-dependent prices for each state variable. A numerical study quantifies the impact of the designed second-best contract in both market structures compared to the business-as-usual scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines whether exporting enhances efficiency and favors specific inputs. We develop a production function model within a dynamic exporting and investment framework, capturing factor-biased technical changes. Using Kalman filtering to address measurement error and propensity score matching to control for self-selection into exporting, we analyze Colombia's manufacturing sectors from 1981 to 1991. New exporters achieve a 4% annual increase in labor-augmenting and unskilled labor relative productivity, with no change in Hicks-neutral productivity. Unskilled labor-augmenting productivity grows by 8% annually, aligning with machinery asset expansion, while TFP rises by 3% per year.</description>

      <title>The Green Peace Dividend: the Effects of Militarization on Emissions and the Green Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that military buildups lead to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions and can disrupt the green transition. Identifying military spending shocks, I use local projections to show that a percentage point rise in the military spending share leads to a 0.9-2% rise in total emissions, as well as a 1% rise in emission intensity, depending on the economy's overall emission intensity. Using a dynamic production network model calibrated for the US, I find that a permanent shock of the same size would increase total emissions by between 0.36% and 1.81%, and emission intensity by between 0.22% and 1.5%. The empirical analysis indicates that green patenting is reduced by 10-25% following such a shock, and the model suggests that investment in renewables could be crowded out by defence spending under certain circumstances, hindering the energy transition. These effects can significantly raise climate damages and temperatures. Depending on the social cost of carbon and the composition of a military spending shock, I estimate that doubling the military spending share in the US in 2017 (equal to 3.3% of GDP) would have led to climate damages equivalent to between 0.07-2.6% of GDP per year.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are nowadays a crucial quantitative tool for policy-makers. However, they did not emerge spontaneously. They are built upon previously established ideas in Economics and relatively recent advancements in Mathematics. This essay provides a comprehensive coverage of their history, starting from the pioneering Neoclassical general equilibrium theories and eventually reaching the New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS). In addition, the mathematical tools involved in formulating a DSGE model are thoroughly presented. I argue that this history has a mixed nature rather than an absolutist or relativist one, that the NNS may have emerged due to the complementary nature of New Classical and New Keynesian theories, and that the recent adoption and development of DSGE models by central banks from different countries has entailed a departure from the goal of building a universally valid theory that Economics has always had. The latter means that DSGE modeling has landed not without loss of generality.</description>

Abstract: As an emerging emitter poised for significant growth in space cooling demand, India requires comprehensive insights into historical emission trends and decarbonization performance to shape future low-carbon cooling strategies. By integrating a bottom-up demand resource energy analysis model and a top-down decomposition method, this study is the first to conduct a state-level analysis of carbon emission trends and the corresponding decarbonization efforts for residential space cooling in urban and rural India from 2000 to 2022. The results indicate that (1) the carbon intensity of residential space cooling in India increased by 292.4% from 2000 to 2022, reaching 513.8 kilograms of carbon dioxide per household. The net state domestic product per capita, representing income, emerged as the primary positive contributor. (2) The increase in carbon emissions from space cooling can be primarily attributed to the use of fans. While fan-based space cooling has nearly saturated Indian urban households, it is anticipated to persist as the primary cooling method in rural households for decades. (3) States with higher decarbonization potential are concentrated in two categories: those with high household income and substantial cooling appliance ownership and those with pronounced unmet cooling demand but low household income and hot climates. Furthermore, it is believed that promoting energy-efficient building designs can be prioritized to achieve affordable space cooling. Overall, this study serves as an effective foundation for formulating and promoting India's future cooling action plan, addressing the country's rising residential cooling demands and striving toward its net-zero goal by 2070.</description>
