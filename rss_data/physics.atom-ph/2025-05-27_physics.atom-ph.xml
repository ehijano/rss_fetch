      <title>Dynamically Polarized SERF Atomic Comagnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic spin sensors are essential for beyond-the-standard-model exploration, biomagnetic measurement, and quantum navigation. While the traditional DC mode spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) comagnetometer achieves ultrahigh sensitivity, further improvements require suppressing technical noise and surpassing standard quantum limit. In this work, we develop a K-Rb-$^{21}$Ne SERF atomic comagnetometer that dynamically polarizes the electron and nuclear spins, shielding signals from direct interference by pump light. We establish a three-phase evolutionary model for hybrid spin ensemble dynamics, yielding a complete analytical solution, and analyze the responses to various spin perturbations. Additionally, we achieve an averaged 38.5 $\%$ suppression of the polarization noise and identify the key factors that limit sensitivity improvements. The dynamically polarized comagnetometer exhibits effective suppression of technical noise and holds the potential to overcome quantum noise limit, while offering promising applications in exploring new physics and precise magnetic field measurements.</description>

      <title>Dissociative positronium attachment in halogen gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that the observed large annihilation rates of ortho-positronium ($o$-Ps) in halogen gases are due to the process of dissociative Ps attachment, ${\rm Ps} + X_2 \to {\rm Ps}X + X$, where $X$ stands for a halogen atom. This process is similar to dissociative electron attachment which leads to formation of negative ions. We calculate the cross section and rate of this process for the F$_2$ molecule, for which it is exothermic, and therefore, can occur at room temperature. We start with the Ps-F$_2$ scattering calculations which take into account electron exchange and correlations within the framework of the free-electron-gas model. The calculations reveal several resonances. Similar to the process of dissociative electron attachment, a $\Sigma_u$ resonance contributes to the dissociative Ps attachment at thermal energies. We determine the resonance position and width as functions of the internuclear separation, and use them as inputs for the local version of the quasiclassical theory of dissociative attachment. Our calculations yield an anomalously large rate constant for the $o$-Ps annihilation process which is only one order of magnitude lower than those observed for Br$_2$ and I$_2$.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Ion-Photoelectron Dynamics through Rabi Oscillations: An ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles numerical simulations of photoionization in neon induced by bichromatic extreme ultraviolet pulses with frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$, specially chosen to make $\omega$ equal to the energy difference between the $2s$ and $2p$ subshells. This allows for the production of photoelectrons from the $2s$ shell by $2\omega$ pulse and from the $2p$ shell by $\omega$ pulse with the same energy. Using the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock method, we explore how Rabi coupling between subshells generates coherence between the corresponding photoelectron wave packets. Our \textit{ab initio} calculations confirm the analytical results derived from the essential-states approach in [K. L. Ishikawa, K. C. Prince, and K. Ueda, J. Phys. Chem. A 127, 10638 (2023)], validating the theoretical predictions. Although we focus on the Ne $2p$ and $2s$ subshells, our approach is applicable to a broad range of systems exhibiting photoionization from multiple subshells. The laser parameters employed in our simulations are available in modern Free Electron Lasers (FELs), and we anticipate that this work could stimulate experimental investigations using FELs to study ion-photoelectron coherence and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics in the Bragg reflection of light by cold atoms: flash effect and superradiant decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to 8 times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model.</description>

      <title>Tunable Fujita-Miyazawa-Type Three-Body Force in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force emerges among three impurity atoms immersed in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. As a result of thermal average over excitations in the medium and impurities as well as expansion with respect to the impurity-medium and Feshbach resonance couplings, two superfluid phonons and a closed channel resonance play a role in producing an effective three-body force, as in the original three-nucleon case in which two pions and a $\Delta$ resonance are involved. The proposed Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force can be enhanced by tuning the closed-channel energy level via an external magnetic field, and moreover, its strength can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the impurity equation of state. Our result gives a new insight into an analogy between atomic polarons and nuclear few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as an analog simulator of molecular bending vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) can be operated as an analog simulator of the two-dimensional vibron model. This algebraic model for the description of bending and stretching vibrations of molecules, in the case of a triatomic molecules, exhibits two phases where linear and bent configurations are stabilised. Spinor BECs can be engineered to simulate states that correspond to linear or bent triatomic molecules, with the BEC's Wigner function encoding information about the molecular configuration. We show how quantum simulations of the bending dynamics of linear molecules can be realized, and how the straightening of a bent molecule leads to a dynamical instability. In the dynamics triggered by the corresponding instability, a significant amount of entanglement is generated, and we characterise the dynamics with the squeezing parameter and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The scaling of the non-Gaussian sensitivity, described by the difference between squeezing and QFI, grows with the system size once the spinor system crosses from the linear to the bent phase, thus serving as a dynamical witness for the quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Electron and positron channeling and photon emission processes in boron doped periodically bent diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted of the profiles of the planar (-110) crystallographic direction in the diamond layer doped with boron atoms. The planar profiles for periodic doping following several ideal dependencies of the boron concentration on the distance in the crystalline medium. Numerical simulations of the channeling and photon emission processes have been carried out for 855 MeV electron and 530 MeV positron beams incident on boron-doped diamond with a four-period bending profile in the samples grown at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The simulations were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. It is shown that the channeling efficiency and the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation strongly depend on the orientation of the incident beam relative to the bent channel profile at the entrance to the boron-doped layer. For the same conditions at the crystal entrance, the intensity of radiation emitted by positrons is significantly higher than that for electrons.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) framework that operates on a simple yet effective premise: subtracting mixed and wrong signals to extract correct signals while providing the benefit of optimal scaling in the condition number of $A$ (denoted as $\mathcal{\kappa}$) for large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ scenarios. This approach, which leads to minimal increase in circuit depth, has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. The term `signal' refers to a feature of $|x\rangle$. We design circuits for overlap and expectation value estimation in the Psi-HHL framework. We demonstrate performance of Psi-HHL via numerical simulations. We carry out two sets of computations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) application to quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 393. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, KH, RbH, and CsH.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion and field-axis misalignment on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <title>An Accessible Formulation for Defining the SI Second Based on Multiple Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic transitions employed in the best of today's optical clocks are a strong foundation for the upcoming redefinition of the SI second. Including multiple transitions in the definition offers increased accuracy, a robust diversity of implementations and would drive continuous performance validation through frequency comparisons. The cost is that such a definition is more complex to articulate and feared to be challenging to implement. We show that it can be made more approachable to intuition, illustration and implementation through formulating this ensemble definition of the SI second in terms of the weighted arithmetic mean of normalized atomic transition frequencies. This definition produces the same results as the presently discussed option up to second order terms of order 10^-30 or below.</description>

      <title>Quantum suppression of cold reactions far from the s-wave energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in chemical reactions are most pronounced at ultracold temperatures, where only a few partial waves contribute. While interference among many partial waves is theoretically expected to persist at higher temperatures, direct evidence for such quantum effects in reactive processes has been lacking. Here, we report the first observation of quantum interference suppressing a chemical reaction in the multi-partial-wave regime: resonant charge exchange between a single $^{87}$Rb atom and its parent ion $^{87}$Rb$^+$. Using quantum-logic detection on a single atom-ion pair and a calibrated in-situ measurement of Langevin collision probabilities, we benchmark the thermally averaged reaction rate against both classical and quantum predictions. We find that the reaction rate is suppressed by over an order of magnitude relative to the classical expectation, despite occurring in the millikelvin temperature regime (more than three orders of magnitude above the $s$-wave threshold), where more than a dozen partial waves contribute. These results establish quantum interference as a key mechanism in chemical reactivity beyond the ultracold limit and offer a platform for probing coherent quantum effects in atom-ion reactions where \textit{ab initio} methods remain intractable.</description>

      <title>A Strong-QCD Regime Measurement of the Proton's Spin Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the strong force, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) remains one of the most important ways to understand the fundamental properties of ordinary matter. However, at low momentum transfer Q2, in the regime where the strong force becomes extremely strong, our understanding of QCD for ordinary nucleons becomes hazy. Several cutting edge theories such as Chiral Perturbation Theory and Lattice QCD have provided valuable predictions in this regime, but Lattice QCD has not yet extended predictions of many important quantities to this kinematic region, and Chiral Perturbation Theory has faced several important disagreements with experimental data for the neutron over the last several decades. It is therefore of extreme importance to have a benchmark of experimental data in the low energy regime for the proton's behavior, as a test of leading theories for the behavior of QCD in this regime. The E08-027 (g2p) experiment ran at Jefferson Lab in 2012 with the goal of collecting this valuable data. Full details of the g2p experiment and my experimental work at the University of New Hampshire are presented in this thesis, as well as a detailed description of the analysis process and the exciting benchmark results, which serve as a direct test of all current and future theories of QCD in the low-Q2 regime.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with atomic qubit arrays: confronting the cost of connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>
