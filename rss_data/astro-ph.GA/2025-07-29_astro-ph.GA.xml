      <title>Tracing Red Giant Members of the Globular Cluster Palomar 5 with APOGEE and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is in the process of being tidally shredded as it orbits the Milky Way. Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ~21 kpc, near apogalacticon (~18 kpc), and it reaches ~5-7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5's leading and trailing arms stretch over 20 degrees on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way's mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia DR3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color-magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE's limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5's tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhaloes, or interactions with passing globular clusters.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERA Survey: The first CO detection in Leo T, the lowest mass known galaxy still hosting cold molecular gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first CO detection in Leo T, representing the most extreme observation of carbon monoxide molecules in the lowest stellar mass gas-rich dwarf galaxy ($M_{\star}$$\sim$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$) known to date. We acquired and present new Atacama Compact Array (ACA) $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) data within our CHIMERA Survey project for the central region of Leo~T, a metal-poor ([M/H]$\sim$-1.7) dwarf in the Milky Way (MW) outskirts. We identified three compact molecular clouds ($&lt;13$ pc) with estimated upper limit virial masses of $M_{\rm mol}$$\sim$5$\times10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ each and a total of 1.4$\pm$0.4$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to $\sim\!3\%$ of the total gas mass. We obtained CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) as high as $\sim$155 M$_{\odot}$ $({\rm K\, km\, s^{-1}\, pc^2})^{-1}$ and mean molecular gas surface densities of $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$$\sim$9 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ that are consistent with values found in dwarf galaxies with extremely low metal content. All CO clouds are shifted ($\sim$60 pc) from the stellar population centers, and only one cloud appears within the densest \hi region. Two clouds have velocity offsets with the \hi of $\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+13$ km s$^{-1}$ being within twice the velocity dispersion ($\Delta v_{\rm los}/\sigma_{\rm HI,los}\sim2$) and probably bound. However, the northern cloud is faster ($\Delta v_{\rm los}\sim\!+57$ km s$^{-1}$); our models with low halo masses ($M_{\rm h}\! \lesssim \!10^9$ M$_{\odot}$) result in unbound orbits, suggesting that this material is likely being expelled from the dwarf, providing evidence for molecular gas depletion. These properties reveal a perturbed dynamics intertwined with star formation processes in low-mass dwarf galaxies, supporting a scenario of episodic bursts until they are fully quenched by the MW environment.</description>

      <title>The Merger-Driven Formation of Classical Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in Romulus25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation volume to study a large sample of late-type gas-rich galaxies with low central surface brightnesses known as classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies and compare them to a mass-matched sample of high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies. We find that classical LSB galaxies make up a substantial fraction of the galaxy population, accounting for ~60% of all central galaxies with 8$\leq$log$_\mathrm{10}$(M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)$\leq$10. In Romulus25, classical LSB galaxies are predominantly formed through major mergers in which the secondary galaxy is co-rotating and aligned with the primary galaxy's gas disk and/or has above average orbital angular momentum at infall. The merger product is a high spin galaxy in which star formation is spread out and inefficient, allowing the galaxy to build up a large supply of relatively unenriched gas. The star formation rates of LSB galaxies are nearly constant over time, leading to stellar populations that are, on average, slightly older and therefore optically redder than those of similar HSB galaxies. However, because LSB galaxies are diffuse and metal-poor, they have very little internal reddening, causing them to appear bluer than HSB galaxies. We also find that, when compared to the bulges of HSB galaxies, the bulges of LSB galaxies are similar in mass, but are lower surface brightness, redder, and more diffuse on average. Despite these differences, classical LSB galaxies are part of the continuum of the galaxy population in Romulus25, constituting one of many evolutionary paths.</description>

      <title>Quenching Through Tidal Gas Removal: Molecular Gas and Star Formation in Tidal Tails of z ~ 0.7 Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical in preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially-resolved multiwavelength study of two z ~ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the SQuIGGLE survey (Studying Quenching in Intermediate-z Galaxies: Gas, anguLar momentum, and Evolution), providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. ALMA CO(2-1) observations show that both galaxies removed ~50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. HST WFC3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits Halpha emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. VLA 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of AGN activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions that appear more turbulent than 'normal' star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas-star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.</description>

      <title>SDSS-IV MaNGA: Physical Origins of Double-Peaked Narrow Emission-Line Spaxels in Barred Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origins of double-peaked narrow emission-line spaxels (DPSs) in barred galaxies are explored through the analysis of a sample of 72 barred double-peaked emission-line galaxies (DPGs) extracted from the MaNGA dataset. In this study, we examine two potential scenarios: the gas inflow along the bar and the formation of a bar-induced gaseous nuclear ring. By applying a classical galactic dynamics model, we calculate the radii and rotational velocities of the nuclear rings for all barred DPGs, and compare them with the observed properties of their DPSs. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the predicted radii of the nuclear rings and the maximum centric distances of the DPSs, as well as a marginal correlation between the predicted rotational velocities of the nuclear rings and the observed maximum velocity differences of the DPSs. These findings provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the DPSs of a barred DPG in MaNGA primarily originate from the convolution of the PSF effect with its bar-induced fast-rotating gaseous nuclear ring.</description>

      <title>A North-South Metallicity Asymmetry in the Outer Galactic disk -- Evidence for the Pericentric Passage of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R &lt; $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R &gt; 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ &lt; \Phi &lt; 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau &gt; 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau &lt; 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency, multi-epoch radio continuum study of the Quintuplet cluster with the Very Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quintuplet cluster, located in the Galactic centre, is one of the few young massive clusters in the Milky Way. It allows us to study dozens of massive, post main sequence stars individually, providing unique insights into the properties of the most massive stars. Our goal is to study the radio continuum emission of the most massive stars in the cluster.
  We carried out a total of nine observations (three in the C- and six in the X-band) of the Quintuplet cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in A-configuration. We cross-matched the detected sources with infrared stellar catalogues to ensure cluster membership, calculated their spectral indices, quantified variability, and inferred clumping-scaled mass-loss rates
  We present the most complete catalogue of radio stars in the Quintuplet cluster to date, with a total of 41 detections, and the deepest images of the cluster in the 4 to 12 GHz range (reaching an rms noise level of $2.3\, \mu\mathrm{Jy/beam}$ in the X-band). The six year baseline of our observations allowed us to perform a robust variability assessment, finding that around $60\%$ of the Quintuplet radio-stars are variable on timescales of months to years. We derived the spectral indices of 28 out of the 41 sources. Based on their spectral indices and variability, we classify 11 of them as colliding-wind binaries, seven as strictly thermal sources, and ten as ambiguous. Including the ambiguous sources, we estimate a multiplicity fraction of ($75\pm22\%$). We also computed upper limits for the mass-loss rates of the thermal radio-stars, finding them in agreement with typical values for WNh and WC stars. Finally, we compare these results to the ones obtained from our analogous study of the Arches cluster.</description>

      <title>Optical Emission-Line Properties of eROSITA-selected SDSS-V Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and discuss optical emission line properties obtained from the analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra for an X-ray selected sample of 3684 galaxies (0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.55), drawn from the eRASS1 catalog. We modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV) X-ray/H$\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\iii]$\lambda 5007$ and broad H$\alpha$ component; as well as the relations between the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ($\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique sample of optical spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources detected by eROSITA. These results highlight the importance of emission line decomposition in AGN classification and refine the connection between X-ray emission and optical emission line properties in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Disks Surrounding Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet photon production rates of the first stars: Impact on the He II $\lambda$ 1640 \AA{} emission line from primordial star clusters and the 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first stars, the chemically pristine Population III, likely played an important role in heating the intergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic dawn. The very high effective temperatures ($\sim 10^5$ K) predicted for the most massive Population III stars could also give rise to tell-tale signatures in the emission-line spectra of early star clusters or small galaxies dominated by such stars. Important quantities in modelling their observational signatures include their photon production rates at ultraviolet energies at which photons are able to ionize hydrogen and helium, dissociate molecular hydrogen and cause Lyman-$\alpha$ heating. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions of Population III stars to explore how these key quantities are affected by the initial mass and rotation of Population III stars given a wide range of models for the evolution of these stars. Our results indicate that rotating Population III stars that evolve to effective temperatures $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K could potentially give rise to a very strong HeII 1640 emission line in the spectra from primordial star clusters, without requiring stellar masses of $\gtrsim 100\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ indicated by previous models for non-rotating Population III stars. At the same time, the observable impact on 21-cm signatures from cosmic dawn and epoch of reionization from our set of rotating stars that evolve to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ K are modest, and produce potentially detectable features in the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum for high Population III star formation efficiencies only.</description>

      <title>JCMT POL-2 observations of magnetic fields potentially shaped by outflows in the pre-planetary nebulae CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first observations of magnetic fields in pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe) made with the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We observed the PPNe CRL 618 and OH231.8+4.2 in 850 $\mu$m polarized light. In both cases, we observe ordered magnetic fields that appear to arise from dusty circumstellar material that has been swept up by the passage of outflows driven by the central post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) star. CRL 618 shows a magnetic field aligned with one of the most extreme position angles of the outflowing bullets ejected from the central source. We hypothesize that polarized emission in CRL 618 may preferentially arise from material in the walls of the dust cavity opened by the ejected bullets. Conversely, OH231.8+4.2 shows a magnetic field that is aligned approximately perpendicular to the outflow direction, which may preferentially arise from an infrared-bright dense clump embedded near the base of the outflow. Despite CRL 618 being carbon-rich and OH231.8+4.2 being oxygen-rich, there is no significant difference in the polarization fractions of the two sources. This suggests that at linear resolutions $\sim 10^{4}$ au, the complexity of the magnetic field geometry on scales smaller than the beam, rather than grain composition, sets the measured polarization fraction of these sources.</description>

Abstract: Outflows and jets launched from the nuclei of galaxies emit radio synchrotron emission that can be used to study the impact of accretion energy on the host galaxy. The decades-long baseline now enabled by large radio surveys allows us to identify cases where new outflows or jets have been launched. Here, we present the results of a targeted VLA program observing four post-starburst galaxies that have brightened significantly in radio emission over the past ~20 years. We obtain quasi-simultaneous observations in five bands (1-18 GHz) for each source. We find peaked spectral energy distributions, indicative of self-absorbed synchrotron emission. While all four sources have risen significantly over the past ~20 years in the 1-2 GHz band, two also show clear recent flares in the 2-4 GHz band. These sources are less luminous than typical peaked spectrum radio AGN. It remains unclear whether these sources are low luminosity analogs of the peaked radio AGN from accreted gas, or driven by tidal disruption events with missed optical flares. Regardless of the source of the accreted material, these newly-launched outflows contain sufficient energy to drive the molecular gas outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and to drive turbulence suppressing star formation.</description>

      <title>Simulating quasar microlensing light curves: High magnification events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar microlensing can be used to constrain important astrophysical properties, such as the accretion disk size and the amount of stars in the lensing galaxy. The associated brightness variations over time, in particular high magnification events (HMEs) and caustic crossings, can yield precise constraints due to their strong dependence on the relative projected velocities of the components and accretion disk size. The next generation of large sky area surveys, such as The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) and Euclid, are expected to find and follow-up thousands of lensed quasars from which such events could be identified and observed. In this work we present a characterization and estimation of all HMEs that could potentially be observed, focusing on systems that could be identified by ground based telescopes. From systems whose minimum image separation is at least 1 arcsec, and their second dimmest image is at least 21.5 magnitudes in the i-band ($\sim560$ in the southern or northern sky), we estimate $\sim60$ HMEs with amplitudes $&gt;0.3$ [mag] in the r-band per year. We find that on average, saddle images are approximately four times more likely to host events than minima, and $\sim10\%$ ($\sim50\%$) of events are caustic crossings for saddles (minima). We also find that HMEs in saddle images can have amplitudes $\sim1-2$ [mag] larger than minima.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as self-gravitating discs accreting on supermassive stars: Spectral appearance and formation pathway of the progenitors to direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.</description>

      <title>Superhydrogenation of indene at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is crucial to understanding molecular hydrogenation formation in the interstellar medium. This process also helps to elucidate the weakening of the aromatic bonds in PAHs, which may function as a carbon reservoir. Tunneling can significantly promote the hydrogenation process in a low to moderate temperature range. We present the hydrogenation sequence of the newly observed PAH molecule, indene, and clarify the tunneling rule at temperature in photodissociation region (PDR) and dark molecular cloud conditions. In addition, we report fit parameters to be utilized in astronomical modeling. The hydrogenation sequence was studied using simple hydrogenation rules and confirmed by barriers from density functional theory (DFT). To make our kinetic studies useful to modelers, we implemented a Monte Carlo method based program to generate and optimize random initial fit parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, and T0) to achieve the statistically best fit. We find that indene hydrogenation follows rules similar to those of other PAHs, such as pentacene, coronene, and corannulene, with binding energies for odd numbered hydrogenation steps ranging from 0.5 to 2 eV and barriers around 0.13 eV for the first, fifth, and seventh hydrogenation steps. The third hydrogenation step is the rate limiting step, similar to what is found for other PAHs. Even numbered hydrogenation steps have lower barriers and lead to more stable intermediates as a result of radical recombinations. The hydrogenation sequence follows a scheme that strongly depends on the PAH's shape, the number of aromatic rings, and the presence of five membered rings. Furthermore, we observe that tunneling plays an important role in the hydrogenation of indene at temperatures between 30 and 75 K, which corresponds to the temperatures of dust in PDRs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Instability of Multi-planet Systems and Free-floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ejection of planets by the instability of planetary systems is a potential source of free-floating planets. We numerically simulate multi-planet systems to study the evolution process, the properties of surviving systems, and the statistics of ejected planets. For systems with only super-Earth planets, we find that the time (in units of the orbital period $P_{1}$ of the innermost planet) for the system to lose the first planet by collision or ejection increases with the semimajor axis of the innermost planet. In contrast, the time (in units of $P_{1}$) for the first close encounter between two planets is identical. These two timescales also depend differently on the orbital spacing between the planets. Most systems with only super-Earths do not have planets ejected. In systems with super-Earths and a cold Jupiter, we discover that a cold Jupiter significantly increases the probability of ejection of the super-Earths by close encounters. Of 38\% of ejected super-Earths, most velocities relative to their parent stars are smaller than $6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. We conservatively estimate that more than 86\% of the surviving two-planet systems in the super-Earths plus cold Jupiter sample are long-term stable by using empirical criteria. Most super-Earths in the remaining two-planet systems are on highly elliptical but stable orbits and have migrated inwards compared with their initial states.</description>

      <title>A Late-Time Rise in Planet Occurrence Reproduces the Galactic Height Trend in Planet Occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While stellar metallicity has long been known to correlate with planetary properties, the galactic metallicity gradient alone does not account for the trend. It is therefore possible that there exists some time-dependent component to planet occurrence in the Milky Way over Gyr timescales, driven by something other than the metal enrichment of the ISM. In this paper, we investigate the observable effect of a time-dependent planet occurrence rate upon a Kepler-like sample of stars. Using a novel planetary system population synthesis code, psps, we impose several prescriptions for time-variable planet occurrence upon our sample. For this study, we employ a simplistic step function fiducial model for Milky Way planet occurrence, where we vary the time of the step and the planet occurrence rate before and after. We then forward model the expected yield for a synthetic Kepler mission as a function of galactic height, employing the mission's footprint and sensitivity to transits. Finally, we compare the modeled trends to the observed result from the mission itself. We find that, broadly speaking, models in which planet occurrence increased by a factor of several within the past few Gyr can reproduce the occurrence-galactic height trend as-observed; this timing is broadly consistent with the galactic kinematic heating timescale. We consider how varying the functional form of our planet occurrence prescription affects our conclusions. Finally, we consider the physical implications of a seemingly recent increase in planet occurrence on Gyr timescales, as part of a broader conversation about the galactic context for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Preferential alignments of exoplanetary orbital planes in Milky Way spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Special orientations of the orbital planes may be reminiscent of the specific conditions that triggered and drove the star formation processes and how these are related to local and global Galactic kinematics. For a special sample of 66 extrasolar planets discovered with the microlensing method it is possible to determine the position angle of the planets in the sky relative to their hosts. We test the hypothesis that such orientations are randomly distributed against the possibility that the orbital planes follow some preferential alignment. We find that planets in the Scutum-Centaurus arm show a significant alignment with the Galactic plane, with an isotropic distribution disfavored by a factor of 10. Bulge planets and disk planets outside this major arm are instead compatible with isotropic distributions or show weak alternative preferences at most. Using the method proposed here, the future Roman microlensing survey will be able to identify and quantify preferential orientations in all structures from the Sun to the bulge with high confidence and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$~au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026. We show that applying a total thrust $\Delta$V of $2.6755{{\rm km~s^{-1}}}$ to lower perijove on September 9, 2025 and then execute a Jupiter Oberth Maneuver, can bring the Juno spacecraft from its orbit around Jupiter to intercept the path of 3I/ATLAS on March 14, 2026. A close fly-by might be able to probe the nature of 3I/ATLAS far better than telescopes on Earth.</description>

      <title>Explaining the "too massive" high-redshift galaxies in JWST data: numerical study of three effects and a simple relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard LCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars, (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pegase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate). As an example, if the high-mass end of the IMF goes as $M^{-1.35}$, the star formation efficiency and inferred stellar galactic mass could be lower by a factor of $\sim 10$ than in the fiducial case. Our examination (keeping the star formation rate constant) of a top-heavy IMF with slope $\alpha$ leads to a simple relation that is a good approximation to the numerical results, $\epsilon(\alpha) \approx \epsilon_{\rm fid}e^{2.66(\alpha -2.35)}$. Since there are more low mass galaxies than high mass galaxies, these effects may result in a large number of seemingly overly massive galaxies compared to the expectations. Thus, the effects studied in this paper may explain both puzzling observations regarding high luminosity galaxies in JWST: the apparently overly massive galaxies as well as the profusion of apparently high mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>When the Wall Fell: Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in T Chamaeleontis using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features of T Cha, a G8-type T Tauri star that has exhibited "seesaw"-type mid-infrared continuum variability over nearly two decades due to the destruction of the disk's inner wall, using JWST/MIRI and Spitzer observations. We report the first detection of weak PAH emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum from 2005. The inner wall destruction in the 2022 JWST epoch allowed more ultraviolet photons to reach the outer disk, increasing the flux levels of PAH bands and enabling their detection well above the continuum. The 11.2 micron PAH flux increases by a factor of three, yet its profile shape remains remarkably stable. The 6.2/11.2 micron flux ratio has increased, but the charge state of the PAH population remains 75% neutral. The PAH features exhibit a "class C" spectral profile, with redshifted peaks and broadened wings consistent with emission from low-mass T Tauri disks. A weak 12.7/11.2 micron ratio points to a lower abundance of duo- and trio-hydrogen modes, implying a predominantly zigzag carbon structure. A faint "class A" sub-component in the 6.2 and 7.7 micron bands may indicate additional PAH processing by ultraviolet radiation from accretion hotspots. Placement on PAH charge-size grids locates T Cha in the low-ionisation, small-size regime (NC &lt;= 30), signifying a largely neutral PAH population across multiple epochs spanning 18 years. Through multi-epoch, high-resolution data from JWST and Spitzer, we identify T Cha as a benchmark source for probing disk evolution and PAH processing, emphasizing the potential of temporal monitoring with JWST.</description>

      <title>From Equipartition to Curvature: The Spectral Evolution of 4FGL Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux transport via reconnection diffusion in different sonic regimes of interstellar MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\'enic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Estimating cluster masses: a comparative study between machine learning and maximum likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare an autoencoder convolutional neural network (AE-CNN) with a conventional maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) for inferring cluster virial masses, $M_v$, directly from the galaxy distribution around clusters, without identifying members or interlopers. The AE-CNN is trained on mock galaxy catalogues, whereas the MLE assumes that clusters of similar mass share the same phase-space galaxy profile. Conceptually, the MLE returns an unbiased estimate of $\log M_v$ at fixed true mass, whereas the AE-CNN approximates the posterior mean, so the true $\log M_v$ is unbiased at fixed estimate. Using MDPL2 mock clusters with redshift space number density as input, the AE-CNN attains an rms scatter of $0.10\,\textrm{dex}$ between predicted and true $\log M_v$, compared with $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$ for the MLE. With inputs based on mean peculiar velocities, binned in redshift space or observed distance, the AE-CNN achieves scatters of $0.12\,\textrm{dex}$ and $0.16\,\textrm{dex}$, respectively, despite strong inhomogeneous Malmquist bias.</description>

      <title>Precovery Observations of 3I/ATLAS from TESS Suggests Possible Distant Activity</title>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is the third macroscopic interstellar object detected traversing the Solar System. Since its initial discovery on UT 01 July 2025, hundreds of hours on a range of observational facilities have been dedicated to measure the physical properties of this object. These observations have provided astrometry to refine the orbital solution, photometry to measure the color, a rotation period and secular light curve, and spectroscopy to characterize the composition of the coma. Here, we report precovery photometry of 3I/ATLAS as observed with NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). 3I/ATLAS was observed nearly continuously by TESS from UT 07 May 2025 to 02 June 2025. We use the shift-stack method to create deep stack images to recover the object. These composite images reveal that 3I/ATLAS has an average TESS magnitude of $T_\textrm{mag} = 19.6 \pm 0.1$ and an absolute visual magnitude of $H_V = 12.5 \pm 0.3$, consistent with magnitudes reported in July 2025, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may have been active out at $\sim 6.4$ au. Additionally, we extract a $\sim 20$ day light curve and find no statistically significant evidence of a nucleus rotation period. Nevertheless, the data presented here are some of the earliest precovery images of 3I/ATLAS and may be used in conjunction with future observations to constrain the properties of our third interstellar interloper.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies in non-local gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires further attention.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic stars in Galactic open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The age determination of symbiotic stars is essential to put further constraints on models explaining these binary systems. In the Galactic field, this is especially problematic because of several limitations due to reddening estimations, for example. We searched for symbiotic stars as members of Galactic open clusters for which the age and overall metallicity can be determined in a statistical sense. The most recent lists of well-established and candidate symbiotic stars and open clusters were matched, and we found seven good candidates from which the well-established symbiotic star CQ Dra seems to be a true member of the old open cluster HSC 1224. The colour-magnitude diagrams for the other candidates raise some doubts about membership.</description>

      <title>Lightcurves of stars in the Chamaeleon I Association</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming regions are essential for studying very young stellar objects of various masses. They still contain a significant amount of dust and gas. We present a study of light curves of stars in the field of the Chamaeleon I association. We use automatic spectral classification with MKCLASS to identify the spectral types of the stars in the field with a light curve from the NEOWISE and Gaia surveys. The light curves are analysed using the software Peranso and astropy. We also used VSX to identify the variability type. Based on astrometry, we have identified 92 stars, 73 of which are members of the association. We received light curves for 55 stars from the Gaia survey and for 69 stars from the ALLWISE/NEOWISE survey. For 28 of them, it was possible to determine the types of variables, mostly T Tauri and Orion variables. The spectral types of the members are mostly cooler M-type stars, with one being a possible chemically peculiar (CP) star. The non-members associated with light curve measurements include spectral types A-G with one CP candidate.</description>

      <title>The Cooling of Old White Dwarfs in 47 Tucanae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analysed the cooling of white dwarfs in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae using deep observations from the Hubble Space Telescope that resolve the white dwarf cooling sequence to late enough cooling times that the white dwarf core has begun to crystallise and the envelope has become convectively coupled to the core. At such late cooling times, both the state of matter assumed for ions in the treatment of element diffusion and the thickness of the outer H envelope become important considerations for modelling white dwarf cooling. Using the stellar evolution software Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we created a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different treatments of element diffusion, as well as different values of the white dwarf mass and H envelope thickness parameters. Three different diffusion scenarios were considered: i) the standard MESA implementation, which implicitly uses an ideal gas approximation for the ions, ii) a custom modified implementation that accounts for non-ideal gas effects, and iii) no diffusion. An unbinned likelihood analysis was performed to compare these cooling models to the observations. This work both constrains the values of parameters important for modelling white dwarf cooling and tests the implementation of element diffusion in MESA to late cooling times. We find that models with thicker H envelopes are preferred and that the standard MESA diffusion treatment produces a best-fitting model that well reproduces the cumulative white dwarf luminosity functions of the observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass Calibrations for Local Low-Mass Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar masses of galaxies are measured using integrated light via several methods -- however, few of these methods were designed for low-mass ($M_{\star}\lesssim10^{8}\rm{M_{\odot}}$) "dwarf" galaxies, whose properties (e.g., stochastic star formation, low metallicity) pose unique challenges for estimating stellar masses. In this work, we quantify the precision and accuracy at which stellar masses of low-mass galaxies can be recovered using UV/optical/IR photometry. We use mock observations of 469 low-mass galaxies from a variety of models, including both semi-empirical models (GRUMPY and UniverseMachine-SAGA) and cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations (MARVELous Dwarfs and FIRE-2), to test literature color-$M_\star/L$ relations and multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) mass estimators. We identify a list of "best practices" for measuring stellar masses of low-mass galaxies from integrated photometry. We find that literature color-$M_\star/L$ relations are often unable to capture the bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of low-mass galaxies, and we develop an updated prescription for stellar mass based on $g-r$ color that is better able to recover stellar masses for the bursty low-mass galaxies in our sample (with ~0.1 dex precision). SED fitting can also precisely recover stellar masses of low-mass galaxies, but this requires thoughtful choices about the form of the assumed SFH: parametric SFHs can underestimate stellar mass by as much as ~0.4 dex, while non-parametric SFHs recover true stellar masses with insignificant offset (-0.03$\pm$0.11 dex). Finally, we also caution that non-informative (wide) dust attenuation priors may introduce $M_\star$ uncertainties of up to ~0.6 dex.</description>

      <title>Dust-UV offsets in high-redshift galaxies in the Cosmic Dawn III simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed puzzling spatial disparities between ALMA dust continuum and UV emission as seen by HST and JWST in galaxies at $z=5-7$ (e.g. ALPINE and REBELS surveys), compelling us to propose a physical interpretation of such offsets. We investigate these offsets using the Cosmic Dawn III (CoDa III) simulation, a state-of-the-art fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics cosmological simulation, which incorporates a dynamical dust model. First of all, we find that our simulated dust masses, while calibrated to match observed ones, yield unrealistically large UV attenuations. In fact, the bright-end galaxy UV Luminosity function is best reproduced using only 7.5\% of the dust content of CoDa III galaxies. With this recalibration, we obtain populations of massive galaxies matching ALPINE and REBELS magnitudes and UV slopes, but with smaller dust masses than observed. In this framework, we also find significant dust-UV offsets in massive, UV-bright galaxies ($\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}&gt; 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$, M$_*&gt;10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, M$_{\rm AB1600}&lt;-21.5$), reaching up to $\sim 2$ pkpc for the most massive systems. Our analysis reveals that these offsets primarily result from severe dust extinction in galactic centers rather than a misalignment between dust and stellar mass distributions. At the spatial resolution of CoDa III (1.65 pkpc at z=6), the dust remains in majority well-aligned with the bulk stellar component, and we predict the dust continuum should therefore align well with the stellar rest-frame NIR component, less affected by dust attenuation. This study highlights the importance of dust in shaping the appearance of early galaxies at UV wavelengths, even as early as in the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

      <title>A grand-design spiral galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of Alaknanda, a large ($\sim10$ kpc diameter), massive ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim10.2$), candidate grand-design spiral galaxy with photometric redshift $z_{phot}\sim4.05$ in the UNCOVER and Medium band, Mega Science surveys with JWST. This is among the highest redshift spiral galaxies discovered with JWST. Our morphological analysis using GALFIT reveals that this galaxy is a well-formed disk, with two symmetric spiral arms that are clearly visible in the GALFIT residual. In the rest-frame near-UV and far-UV, we clearly see the beads-on-a-string pattern of star formation; in the rest-frame visible bands, each string appears as an arm. Spectral energy distribution modeling using the BAGPIPES and Prospector codes is strongly constrained by detections and flux measurements in 21 JWST and HST filters. From the BAGPIPES modeling, the stellar mass-weighted age is $\sim 199$ Myr, implying 50\% of the stars in the galaxy formed after $z\sim4.6$. This is a highly star-forming galaxy with a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 63 \, M_\odot \, \text{yr}^{-1}$. We detect flux excesses in the F250M and F335M filters due to the presence of H-$\alpha$+[NII] and [OIII]+H-$\beta$ emission line complexes respectively. Detection of a spiral galaxy at $z \sim 4$ indicates that massive and large spiral galaxies and disks were already in place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. Future observations with NIRSpec IFU and ALMA will be able to probe the kinematics of the galactic disk, throwing light on the possible origin of the spiral arms in this galaxy.</description>

      <title>Kinematical Modeling of the Resolved Stellar Outskirts of M32: Constraints on Tidal Stripping Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the only compact elliptical close enough to resolve into individual stars, the satellite dwarf galaxy M32 provides a unique opportunity for exploring the origins of such rare galaxies. In this work, we combined archival and novel Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy from a southern extension of the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey with optical HST imaging from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury (PHAST) survey. The resulting sample of 2525 giant stars is unprecedented both in size and spatial coverage (0.9-15.5 arcmin, or out to $\sim$23$r_{\rm eff}$ and $\sim$30$r_{\rm eff}$ along M32's major and minor axes) for probing the resolved stellar outskirts of M32. Given the structurally complex region near M32 on the sky, we modeled M32's line-of-sight kinematics simultaneously alongside M31's rotating stellar disk and potential outliers corresponding to M31's kinematically hot stellar halo and/or tidal substructure. Inside the radius corresponding to the observed twisting of isophotal contours in M32's surface brightness profile ($R_{\rm iso} \sim$ 5$r_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 150'' or 0.56 kpc), M32 exhibits a line-of-sight velocity distribution characteristic of ordered rotation, transitioning to a distribution with heavier outliers beyond this radius. Within $R_{\rm iso}$, the rotational direction is aligned with M32's major-axis rotation, but shifts to become roughly aligned with M32's minor axis beyond $R_{\rm iso}$. We interpret these kinematical signatures in the stellar outskirts of M32 as evidence of tidal distortion from interactions with M31 and discuss their implications for M32 formation pathways.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations I: Tension Between Smooth Stellar Feedback Models and Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass ($10^{8.0}M_\odot\leq M_\star \lesssim10^{12.0}M_\odot$) and redshift ($0\leq z\leq8$) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback not providing sufficient mixing to quickly flatten gradients. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{10.0}-10^{11.0}M_\odot$, while galaxies with stellar masses $&lt; 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $&gt;10^{11}M_\odot$ exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the $1&lt;z&lt;4$ observational literature. At $z&gt;6$, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content radially, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Gas Density, Velocity, and Magnetic Fields in Cool-Core Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence within the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity, particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations are designed to resemble massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus, while varying the initial plasma $\beta$ values (100, 200, and 500). Our findings indicate that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity appear similar across different $\beta$ scenarios, their spatial distributions and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent, becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at $\beta=500$. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the efficacy of the Synchrotron Intensity Gradient (SIG) method for tracing magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with the magnetic field across all three $\beta$ scenarios, confirming the SIG's insensitivity to the medium's magnetization level.</description>

      <title>Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion Models For Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_{\rm H}\gtrsim10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.</description>

Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>

Abstract: The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.</description>

      <title>An automated method for finding the most distant quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys such as Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman) will detect hundreds of high-redshift (z &gt; 7) quasars, but distinguishing them from the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant data analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing selection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes and ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then combined using the F_beta statistic (where beta is a parameter which can be tuned to prioritise completeness). The result is an automated, reproduceable and objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both simulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this cross-matched dataset we achieve an area under the curve (AUC) score of up to 0.81 and an F_3 score of up to 0.79; or, if the completeness is fixed to be 0.9, then we can obtain an efficiency of 0.15. This is sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when available.</description>

      <title>The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) Python library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis is a crucial methodology in astrophysics, enabling the interpretation of the integrated light of galaxies and stellar clusters. By combining empirical and/or theoretical libraries of the spectral energy distribution emitted by simple stellar populations (SSPs) with models of the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution, population synthesis facilitates the estimation of essential galaxy properties, such as total stellar mass, star formation rate, mass-weighted age and metallicity, etc. The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) is a Python library that offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for stellar population synthesis. Its main goal is to compute composite spectra using different galaxy evolution models and SSP libraries with ease and efficiency. It incorporates additional effects, such as cosmic redshift and dust extinction, and it computes several observable quantities derived from the spectra, including broadband photometric fluxes and equivalent widths.</description>
