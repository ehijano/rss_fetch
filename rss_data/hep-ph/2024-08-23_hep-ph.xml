      <title>Nonminimal Superheavy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational production of superheavy scalar fields with nonminimal coupling during and after inflation. We derive analytical approximations using the mode function solution in a de Sitter background and also apply the steepest descent method. We study both positive and negative nonminimal couplings and show that their comoving number density spectra behave differently in the short and long wavelength regimes. We numerically compute the comoving number density spectra and dark matter abundance for a broad range of superheavy spectator fields exceeding the Hubble scale during inflation, with $m_{\chi} &gt; H_I$, and nonminimal couplings ranging from $-300 \leq \xi \leq 300$. When computing the allowed dark matter parameter space, we impose the maximum reheating temperature constraint, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraint, and the isocurvature constraint. We show that the presence of a positive or negative coupling $\xi$ can expand the parameter space up to $3$ orders of magnitude above the Hubble inflationary scale, allowing such dark matter candidates to be as heavy as $\sim 10^{16} \, \rm{GeV}$ in the Starobinsky model of inflation.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Nonstandard Interactions and Lepton Flavor Universality violation at SND@LHC via charm production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect of neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) involving the charm quark at SND@LHC. Using an effective description of new physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we constrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and three-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays not only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and include decays to the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$ final states. We also consider constraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics in neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for various benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits. Finally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV) assuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.</description>

      <title>Anapole moment of neutrinos and radioactive sources near liquid xenon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that placing a radioactive source such as ${}^{51}$Cr near a liquid xenon detector may allow to detect the contribution induced by the anapole moment to neutrino-electron scattering in the Standard Model. Although the anapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral shape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\sim$ 10 tonne $\times$ year at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient statistics. We also discuss a simple model where the anapole moment of neutrinos is shifted with respect to the SM expectation, further demonstrating how a potential measurement of the anapole moment of neutrinos would allow to constrain new physics.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-$p$ bound state and completeness of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a bound state of a $\phi$ meson and proton has been recently indicated on the basis of a combined analysis of the measured $\phi$-$p$ correlation function and the QCD lattice calculations of $\phi$-$p$ interaction in the spin 1/2 and 3/2 channels. We check whether the correlation functions and bound state formation rate satisfy the sum rule which follows from the completeness of quantum states. The sum rule is not satisfied but it is close to it, suggesting that the inferred scattering parameters, which determine the correlation functions, are not fully consistent with the potential responsible for the bound state existence.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Light Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new bounds on hadronically-interacting, sub-GeV mass dark matter. First, we show that one-loop interactions with photons can be sufficient to maintain equilibrium between the dark matter and Standard Model sectors at MeV temperatures, resulting in constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. Using chiral perturbation theory, we find that this leads to an upper bound on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross-section that is orders of magnitude stronger than existing astrophysical constraints. Furthermore, we compute new bounds from rare Kaon decays and find that these provide even stronger constraints. Our results have implications for future direct detection experiments aiming to search for MeV-scale dark matter.</description>

      <title>Three-zero texture of quark-mass matrices as a solution to the strong CP problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong charge-parity (CP) problem has been a long-standing problem in particle physics since 1976, illustrating the small CP-violation phase in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The axion, based on the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, is the most popular solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution based on the three-zero texture of quark mass matrices without additional heavy quark states, which has been shown to fit data well. We show that the required three-zero texture is naturally constructed in a six-dimensional spacetime with a $\mathbf{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold compactification.</description>

      <title>F\'eeton dark matter above the $e^-e^+$ threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new gauge boson introduced in the minimal extension of the standard model (SM) by gauging the U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry plays the role of dark matter when the U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ gauge coupling is highly suppressed. This dark matter, named the F\'eeton dark matter is known to be efficiently created in the early universe by inflationary fluctuations with minimal gravity coupling, hence the framework, the gauged U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ extended SM + inflation, solves the four major problems of the SM; neutrino masses/mixings, dark matter, baryon asymmetry of the universe, and the initial condition of the universe (inflation). We comprehensively study the phenomenology of the dark matter when it is heavier than the $e^- e^+$ threshold, namely twice the electron mass, considering the threshold effect on the dark matter decay into $e^- e^+$. The viable parameter region is found only in the threshold region, while the branching fraction of the decay into $e^- e^+$ (i.e., the $e^- e^+$ signal) never vanishes even at the threshold due to the effect. As a result, the pure U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ extension without the kinetic mixing between the U(1)$_{\rm B-L}$ and hyper-charge gauge bosons have already been excluded by the present observation of the 511\,keV photon from the galactic center. So, the F\'eeton dark matter requires a non-zero kinetic mixing to be a viable dark matter candidate and will be efficiently explored by future MeV-gamma ray telescopes thanks to the non-vanishing decay process into $e^- e^+$.</description>

      <title>X650-&gt;ZZ/WW/H125H95/A450Z -- scalar, tensor or both ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At ICHEP 2024 CMS has published RUN2 results for X650-&gt;ZZ-&gt;4leptons and reached the conclusion that there is no evidence for a scalar resonance H650 decaying into ZZ, as was also concluded by ATLAS using an MVA analysis optimised for a scalar particle. Since this resonance is indicated into ZZ in a Cut Based Analysis and into three other modes: WW, H95H125 and A450Z, the present paper is an attempt to understand these apparent contradictions. Our conclusion, to be confirmed by ATLAS and CMS experiments, is that strict selections for the reaction H650-&gt;ZZ mode seem inadequate, cutting as much into the signal than into the background, therefore reducing its statistical significance. A possible interpretation of this behaviour is that these selections are inefficient for a tensor particle decaying into ZZ with an angular distributions similar to the Drell Yan background. If true, our description of the various findings in term of the Georgi Machacek model needs to be deeply revised, which is attempted in the present note. A scenario with T650 as a tensor resonance is presented which naturally accommodates WW/ZZ and H95H125 decays, while we suggest that A450Z coud come from a scalar resonance degenerate in mass with T650.</description>

      <title>Multiple testing for signal-agnostic searches of new physics with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the question of how to enhance signal-agnostic searches by leveraging multiple testing strategies. Specifically, we consider hypothesis tests relying on machine learning, where model selection can introduce a bias towards specific families of new physics signals. We show that it is beneficial to combine different tests, characterised by distinct choices of hyperparameters, and that performances comparable to the best available test are generally achieved while providing a more uniform response to various types of anomalies. Focusing on the New Physics Learning Machine, a methodology to perform a signal-agnostic likelihood-ratio test, we explore a number of approaches to multiple testing, such as combining p-values and aggregating test statistics.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $W^+ W^+$ production in association with three jets at NLO QCD matched with parton shower</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading order QCD calculation for the electroweak production of a pair of same-sign weak gauge bosons in association with three jets in the region dominated by vector boson scattering, and its matching with parton-shower programs according to the POWHEG formalism. Our calculation allows for an accurate description of jet observables crucial for the optimization of experimental analyses of vector boson scattering processes. We find QCD corrections and parton-shower effects moderate in size for inclusive quantities and distributions of the tagging jets. A larger impact of these corrections is observed for subleading jets.</description>

      <title>Q-ball collisions and their Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sydney Coleman's Q-ball remains a compelling instance of localised object formation within classical field theory, independently of the quantum evolution. The theoretical possibility of such objects forming and colliding in the early universe from models such as Affleck-Dine fragmentation, or from a number of mechanisms where they are produced copiously with various size and charges to be dark matter candidates, makes it important to study in detail Q-ball collision phenomenology. In this work we present results from a study of Q-ball collisions and their gravitational waves, using a new general code package for scalar fields coupled to gravity. We then comment on the possibility of future gravitational wave detectors searching for signals of Q-ball collisions.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity in the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a renormalizable low-energy model for QCD in the 2SC phase of QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are the mesons (sigma and pions), quarks and diquarks. Some of the parameters of the model can be determined by expressing them in terms of the vacuum meson masses and pion decay constant using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are considered free, although they in principle can be calculated from QCD. The thermodynamic potential is calculated in a mean-field approximation taking only quark loops into account. In this approximation, we derive a set of renormalization group equations for the running masses and couplings. The solutions to these equations are used to improve the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ and thereby thermodynamic quantities. Four parameter sets are chosen and the phase diagram in the $\bar{\mu}$--$T$ (with $\bar{\mu}={1\over3}\mu_B$) plane is obtained. We also calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of $\bar{\mu}$ at vanishing temperature. For large values of $\bar{\mu}$, the speed of sound approaches the conformal limit $c_s={1\over\sqrt{3}}$ from above, in disagreement with perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>From strange-quark tagging to fragmentation tagging with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply advanced machine learning techniques to two challenging jet classification problems at the LHC. The first is strange-quark tagging, in particular distinguishing strange-quark jets from down-quark jets. The second, which we term fragmentation tagging, involves identifying the fragmentation channel of a quark. We exemplify the latter by training neural networks to differentiate between bottom jets containing a bottom baryon and those containing a bottom meson. The common challenge in these two problems is that neither quark lifetimes and masses nor parton showering provide discriminating tools, making it necessary to rely on differences in the distributions of the hadron types contained in each type of jet and their kinematics. For these classification tasks, we employ variations of Graph Attention Networks and the Particle Transformer, which receive jet and all constituent properties as inputs. We compare their performance to a simple Multilayer Perceptron that uses simple variables. We find that the more sophisticated architectures do not improve $s$-quark versus $d$-quark jet differentiation by a significant amount, but they do lead to a significant gain in $b$-baryon versus $b$-meson jet differentiation.</description>

      <title>Singlet-Doublet Fermionic Dark Matter in Gauge Theory of Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are considering a minimal $U(1)_B$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) by promoting the baryon number as a local gauge symmetry to accommodate a stable dark matter (DM) candidate. The gauge theory of baryons induces non-trivial triangle gauge anomalies, and we provide a simple anomaly-free solution by adding three exotic fermions. A scalar $S$ spontaneously breaks the $U(1)_B$ symmetry, leaving behind a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry that ensures the stability of the lightest exotic fermion was originally introduced to cancel the triangle gauge anomalies. Scenarios with weakly interacting DM candidates having non-zero hypercharge usually face stringent constraints from experimental bounds on the DM spin-independent direct-detection (SIDD) cross-section. In this work, we consider a two-component singlet-doublet fermionic dark matter scenario, which significantly relaxes the constraints from bounds on the DM SIDD cross-section for suppressed singlet-doublet mixing. We show that the model offers a viable parameter space for a cosmologically consistent DM candidate that can be probed through direct and indirect searches, collider experiments, and gravitational wave (GW) experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments. In particular, the proton and deuteron fussion to ${}^3 \mathrm{He}$ of the $pp$ chain that produces energetic neutrino and gamma photon with 5.5$\,$MeV of energy release can also produce a pair of dark matter particles. Besides, we establish an analytical formalism of using the Boltzmann equation to study the solar attenuation effect on the produced dark matter flux. The projected sensitivity is illustrated with Argon target at the DarkSide-LowMass experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermal and non-thermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>A novel method to indirectly reconstruct neutrinos in collider experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusive tagging method is a highly efficient reconstruction approach, especially in beauty-physics experiments. In this Letter, we introduce an innovative inclusive-tagging scheme that is capable of capturing the four-momentum of an undetected particle on the signal side, such as a neutrino, K_L^0, etc., in collider experiments. This proposed scheme, based on an asymptotically recursive vector sequence, has the potential to catalyze a significant transformation in the capabilities of the inclusive tagging method and might also have promising applications in other fields.</description>

      <title>UV Completion of Neutral Triple Gauge Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as they are absent in the SM and are first generated by dimension-8 operators in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We study the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like heavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC vertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit. Such fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy fermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce dimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields, which are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating off-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients and in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In the heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by conventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic corrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics via nTGCs at the high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral eigenfunction decomposition of a Fokker-Planck operator for relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spectral solution method is proposed to solve a previuously developed non-equilibrium statistical model describing partial thermalization of produced charged hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, thus improving the accuracy of the numerical solution. The particle's phase-space trajectories are treated as drift-diffusion stochastic process, leading to a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for the single-particle probability distribution function. The drift and diffusion coefficients are derived from the expected asymptotic states via appropriate fluctuation-dissipation relations, and the resulting FPE is then solved numerically using a spectral eigenfunction decomposition. The calculated time-dependent particle distributions are compared to Pb-Pb data from the ATLAS and ALICE collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Baykara, Tarazi and Vafa discussed the existence of quasicrystalline string vacua that contain a single neutral moduli, the dilaton, and studied compactifications of the non-supersymmetric $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic-string on these spaces. We discuss a specific class of quasi-realistic string vacua with similar properties that has been known since the late eighties and analyse the vacuum energy in several non-supersymmetric examples that correspond to compactifications of tachyon free ten dimensional vacua as well as compactifications of tachyonic ten dimensional vacua. Our analysis uses the Free Fermionic Formalism of the heterotic-string in four dimensions and employs asymmetric boundary conditions that project all the geometrical moduli by Generalised GSO projections. This methodology produces models with both positive and negative spacetime potential at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Surface Kinematics and "The" Yang-Mills Integrand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to define a canonical loop integrand for non-supersymmetric gluon scattering amplitudes in the planar limit. Naive integrands are inflicted with $1/0$ ambiguities associated with tadpoles and massless external bubbles, which destroy integrand-level gauge invariance as well as consistent on-shell factorization on single loop-cuts. In this letter, we show that this essentially kinematical obstruction to defining "the" integrand for Yang-Mills theory has a structural solution, handed to us by the formulation of gluon amplitudes in terms of curves on surfaces. This defines "surface kinematics" generalizing momenta, making it possible to define "the" integrand satisfying both a (surface generalized) notion of gauge-invariance and consistent loop-cuts. The integrand also vanishes at infinity in appropriate directions, allowing it to be recursively computed for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in any number of dimensions. We illustrate these ideas through one loop for all multiplicity, and for the simplest two-loop integrand.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <title>Quark and Gluon Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Revised and Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of small Bjorken-$x$ evolution of the gluon and flavor-singlet quark helicity distributions in the shock wave ($s$-channel) formalism. Earlier works on the subject in the same framework resulted in an evolution equation for the gluon field-strength $F^{12}$ and quark "axial current" ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$ operators (sandwiched between the appropriate light-cone Wilson lines) in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA: summing powers of $\alpha_s\,\ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant). In this work, we observe that an important mixing of the above operators with another gluon operator, $\overleftarrow{D}^i\,{D}^i$, also sandwiched between the light-cone Wilson lines (with the repeated index $i=1,2$ summed over), was missing in the previous works. This operator has the physical meaning of the sub-eikonal (covariant) phase: its contribution to helicity evolution is shown to be proportional to another sub-eikonal operator, $D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, which is related to the Jaffe-Manohar polarized gluon distribution. In this work we include this operator into small-$x$ helicity evolution, and construct a novel evolution mixing all three operators ($D^i-\overleftarrow{D}^i$, $F^{12}$, and ${\bar\psi}\gamma^+\gamma^5\psi$), generalizing the previous results. We also construct closed DLA evolution equations in the large-$N_c$ and large-$N_c\&amp; N_f$ limits, with $N_c$ and $N_f$ the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively. Solving the large-$N_c$ equations numerically we obtain the following small-$x$ asymptotics of the quark and gluon helicity distributions $\Delta \Sigma$ and $\Delta G$, along with the $g_1$ structure function, \[\Delta\Sigma(x,Q^2)\sim\Delta G(x,Q^2)\sim g_1(x,Q^2)\sim\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{3.66\,\sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s\,N_c}{2\pi}}},\] in complete agreement with the earlier work by Bartels, Ermolaev and Ryskin.</description>

Abstract: We study $B_c$ production in high-energy nuclear collisions in a transport approach with dissociation and regeneration at finite temperatures. Due to the rare production in p+p collisions and the strong combination of uncorrelated $c$ and $\bar b$ quarks in the quark-gluon plasma, the $B_c$ yield is significantly enhanced in the nuclear collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Moreover, the centrality and momentum-dependent yield of $B_c$ sensitively reflect the thermalization degree of bottom quarks. And the newly observed experimental data favors a far from the thermal bottom quark distribution in the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Axion minicluster streams in the solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consequence of QCD axion dark matter being born after inflation is the emergence of small-scale substructures known as miniclusters. Although miniclusters merge to form minihalos, this intrinsic granularity is expected to remain imprinted on small scales in our galaxy, leading to potentially damaging consequences for the campaign to detect axions directly on Earth. This picture, however, is modified when one takes into account the fact that encounters with stars will tidally strip mass from the miniclusters, creating pc-long tidal streams that act to refill the dark matter distribution. Here we ask whether or not this stripping rescues experimental prospects from the worst-case scenario in which the majority of axions remain bound up in unobservably small miniclusters. We find that the density sampled by terrestrial experiment on mpc-scales will be, on average, around 70--90\% of the average local DM density, and at a typical point in the solar neighbourhood, we expect most of the dark matter to be comprised of debris from $\mathcal{O}(10^2$--$10^3)$ overlapping streams. If haloscopes can measure the axion signal with high-enough frequency resolution, then these streams are revealed in the form of an intrinsically spiky lineshape, in stark contrast with the standard assumption of a smooth, featureless Maxwellian distribution -- a unique prediction that constitutes a way for experiments to distinguish between pre and post-inflationary axion cosmologies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, under the framework of vector meson dominance model, the trace anomaly contribution value inside neutrons are extracted for the first time based on vector meson photoproduction data. Furthermore, we systematically compare and analyze the trace anomaly contributions of protons and neutrons. The results show that the trace anomaly contributions of protons and neutrons are close, which indirectly confirms that their internal structures and dynamic properties may have certain similarities. In addition, the main factors affecting the extraction of the trace anomaly contribution of nucleons are discussed in detail. This study not only provides a theoretical basis for us to better understand the source of nucleon mass, but also makes a useful exploration and discussion on how to extract the trace anomaly contribution of nucleon more accurately in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A minimal non-thermal dark matter model that can explain both the existence of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in the universe is studied. It requires two color-triplet, iso-singlet scalars with $\mathcal{O}$(TeV) masses and a singlet Majorana fermion with a mass of $\mathcal{O}$(GeV). The fermion becomes stable and can play the role of the dark matter candidate. We consider the fermion to interact with a top quark via the exchange of QCD-charged scalar fields coupled dominantly to third generation fermions. The signature of a single top quark production associated with a bottom quark and large missing transverse momentum opens up the possibility to search for this type of model at the LHC in a way complementary to existing monotop searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>

      <title>CP Violation of Baryon Decays with $N\pi$ Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a long-standing puzzle that the CP violation (CPV) in the baryon systems has never been well established in experiments, while the CPV of mesons have been observed by decades. In this paper, we propose that the CPV of baryon decays can be generated with the rescatterings of a nucleon and a pion into some final states, i.e. $N\pi\to N\pi$ or $N\pi\pi$. Benefited by the fruitful data of $N\pi$ scatterings, we can model-independently analyze the strong phases of $b$-baryon decays using the partial wave amplitudes of $N\pi$ scatterings. This makes a great advantage to predict the CPV of baryon decays. We study the processes of $\Lambda_b^0\to (p\pi^+\pi^-)h^-$ and $(p\pi^0)h^-$ with $h=\pi$ or $K$. It is found that the global CPV of the above processes in the invariant mass region of $N\pi$ scatterings are at the order of several percent. More importantly, the regional CPV in the Dalitz plot can reach as large as $20\%$. Therefore, we suggest to measure the CPV of these processes, which has a large possibility to achieve the first observation of CPV in the baryon system.</description>

      <title>Excluding Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Based on Solar System Ephemeris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current cosmological constraints allow primordial black holes (PBHs) to constitute dark matter in the mass range of 10^{18}-10^{22}g. We show that a major portion of this logarithmic window can be ruled-out based on the Solar System ephemeris, given that the external mass enclosed within 50 au from the Sun did not change by more than ~5x10^{-14} solar masses per year in recent decades.</description>

      <title>Fitting the DESI BAO Data with Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity constrains the range of validity of quantum field theory. As has been pointed out by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN), such effects lead to interdependent ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs that may stabilize the dark energy of the universe against quantum corrections, if the IR cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. As a consequence of the cosmic expansion, this argument implies a time-dependent dark energy density. In this paper we confront this idea with recent data from DESI BAO, Hubble and supernova measurements. We find that the CKN model provides a better fit to the data than the $\Lambda$CDM model and can compete with other models of time-dependent dark energy that have been studied so far.</description>

      <title>Cluster production and the chemical freeze-out in expanding hot dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss medium effects on light cluster production in the QCD phase diagram by relating Mott transition lines to those for chemical freeze-out. In heavy-ion collisions at highest energies provided by the LHC, light cluster abundances should follow the statistical model because of low baryon densities. Chemical freeze-out in this domain is correlated with the QCD crossover transition. At low energies, in the nuclear fragmentation region, where the freeze-out interferes with the liquid-gas phase transition, self-energy and Pauli blocking effects are important. We demonstrate that at intermediate energies the chemical freeze-out line correlates with the maximum mass fraction of nuclear bound states, in particular $\alpha$ particles. In this domain, the HADES, FAIR and NICA experiments can give new insights.</description>

      <title>Linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics via random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>
