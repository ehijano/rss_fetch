      <title>A Kinematic History of Stellar Encounters with Beta Pictoris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta Pictoris is an A-type star hosting a complex planetary system with two massive gas giants and a prominent debris disk. Variable absorption lines in its stellar spectrum have been interpreted as signatures of exocomets (comet-like bodies transiting the star). Stellar flybys can gravitationally perturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and potentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet showers.
  We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet activity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in the past and future.
  We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary spectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc of beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in an axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within 2 pc of the system.
  We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with resolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of five binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr. For four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2 pc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the present.
  Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of the identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated field stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures, although stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a potential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete reconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a robust foundation for future dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Map of the Universe: Detection of the Wolf-Rayet Star WR40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radio-continuum detection of the well-known Wolf-Rayet star WR40 at 943.5 MHz using observations from the EMU survey. We find that the shell surrounding WR40, known as RCW 58, has a flux density of 158.9+/-15.8 mJy and the star itself is 0.41+/-0.04 mJy. The shell size is found to be 9' x 6', which matches well with the shell in Halpha and is similarly matched to the shell at 22 um in infrared. Using Gaia data, we derive a linear size of 7.32(+/-0.34) x 4.89(+/-0.23) pc at a distance of 2.79+/-0.13 kpc. We use previous ATCA observations at 8.64, 4.80, and 2.4 GHz to determine a spectral index of WR40, which is estimated to be alpha = 0.80+/-0.11, indicating that the emission from the star is thermal.</description>

      <title>Exploring Stellar Activity in a Sample of Active M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most M dwarfs show higher chromospheric activity, often exceeding solar levels. Characterizing stellar activity is essential, particularly since these stars are prime targets in the search for habitable exoplanets. We investigate the stellar activity of active M dwarfs using TESS photometry combined with spectroscopic observations. We explore relations between flare occurrence rate (FOR), flare energies, rotation period, starspot filling factor, and chromospheric indicators. We also examine correlations between flare amplitude, duration, and cumulative flare frequency distributions to probe the mechanisms behind magnetic activity. We find that FOR is flat across spectral types M0-M4 but declines for cooler M dwarfs. Rapid rotators ($P_{\rm rot} &lt; 1$ day) display significantly higher FOR and flare activity. M dwarfs with higher FOR tend to have lower flare amplitudes, suggesting that frequent flares are generally less energetic. For stars with 0.15--0.76 $M_\odot$, the median $L_{H\alpha}/L_{\rm bol}$ varies by a factor of 2.5 across mass bins of 0.1 $M_\odot$, while $\Delta$EW decreases by 92\%. The cumulative flare frequency distributions show a decrease in the power-law slope from M0 to M5, with $\alpha$ ranging from 1.68 to 1.95. Our results indicate a transition in stellar activity near M4, where stronger H$\alpha$ emission coincides with higher FOR. We confirm that chromospheric and flare activity follow a power-law relation, highlighting the interplay between magnetic fields and flaring in M dwarfs. We also find that fast rotators sustain frequent flaring through strong dynamos, and that highly active stars dissipate magnetic energy via numerous low-energy flares rather than rare high-energy ones.</description>

      <title>Band Splitting in m-Type II radio Bursts and their Role in Coronal Parameter Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II radio bursts are signatures of shock waves generated by solar eruptions, observed at radio wavelengths. While metric (m) type II bursts originate in the lower corona, their longer-wavelength (up to kilometers) counterparts extend into interplanetary space. A rare but valuable feature observed in some type II bursts is band splitting in their dynamic spectra, which provides crucial insights into physical parameters such as shock speed, Alfv\'en Mach number, Alfv\'en speed, and coronal magnetic field strength (B). In this study, we investigate band-splitting in 44 m-type II radio bursts observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network during solar cycle 24 (2009 -- 2019). These events exhibit splitting in both fundamental and harmonic bands and are analyzed under both perpendicular and parallel shocks. All events are associated to solar flares and 41 (93 \%) with the coronal mass ejections. Shock speeds, derived using a hybrid coronal density model proposed by \cite{Vrsnak2004}, range from $\approx$ 350 to 1727 \kms. The relative bandwidth (BDW) of the split bands remains constant with frequency and height. Alfv\'en Mach numbers indicate moderate shock strength (1.06 -- 3.38), while Alfv\'en speeds and $B$ vary from $\approx$ 230 -- 1294 \kms\ and $\approx$ 0.48 -- 7.13 G, respectively. Power-law relationships are established as $BDW \propto f_L^{-0.4}$ and $BDW \propto R^{\sim1}$, while the coronal magnetic field decreases with height as $B \propto R^{\sim-3}$. These results enhance our understanding of shock dynamics and magnetic field structures in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Excitation, Propagation and Damping of Quasi-Periodic Fast Magnetosonic Waves in Realistic Coronal Active Region Magnetic Field Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic fast propagating magnetosonic waves (QFPs) were discovered in the solar corona in EUV since the launch of SDO spacecraft more than a decade ago. The QFP waves are associated with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) providing information on flare pulsations as well as on the magnetic field by MHD wave seismology. Previous models of QFP waves used primarily idealized magnetic active region structures. However, more realistic active region numerical models are needed to improve the application of coronal seismology to observations of waves in coronal structures. Here, we extend the previous models by including realistic magnetic configuration based on an observed coronal active region in a case study using AR 11166 observed on March 10, 2011 by SDO/AIA, using potential field extrapolation of photospheric magnetic field with realistic gravitationally stratified density structure { with typical coronal temperature} in our resistive 3D MHD model. We aim at reproducing the observed QFPs properties, such as directionality, propagation, reflection, nonlinearity, and damping of these waves. We model various forms of excitation of QFPs through time dependent boundary conditions, and localized pulses at the base of the corona. We produce synthetic emission measure (EM) maps from the 3D MHD modeling results to facilitate comparison to EUV observations. We find that the present more realistic model provides better qualitative agreement with observations compared to previous idealized models, improving the study of QFP wave excitation, propagation and damping in coronal ARs, with potential applications to coronal seismology.</description>

      <title>The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds III. The first, extragalactic Mg-K anticorrelation: the LMC globular cluster NGC 1786</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we derived [K/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios for six stars of the old globular cluster NGC 1786 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employed high-resolution spectra acquired with the MIKE spectrograph mounted at the Magellan/Clay telescope. We found a clear Mg-K anticorrelation among the analyzed stars. In particular, the Mg-poor stars ([Mg/Fe] &lt; 0.0 dex) are enriched by ~ 0.25 dex in [K/Fe] compared to the Mg-rich stars ([Mg/Fe] &gt; 0.0 dex). This finding makes NGC 1786 the first globular cluster residing in an external galaxy in which such extreme chemical anomaly has been detected. The observed trend nicely agrees with those observed in Galactic globular clusters hosting Mg-poor stars, such as NGC 2808, and Omega Centauri suggesting that such chemical anomaly is an ubiquitous feature of old, massive, and metal-poor stellar systems and it does not depend on the properties of the parent galaxy in which the cluster formed. Also, Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations were detected among the stars of NGC 1786. The newly discovered Mg-K anticorrelation reinforces the idea that stars capable of activating the complete MgAl cycle are responsible for the observed chemical anomalies in these clusters. In this context, asymptotic giant branch stars seem to be a valuable model since they are able to produce K while depleting Mg. However, the precise and complete physics of this model remains a subject of debate.</description>

      <title>Is there a unique asteroseismic interior model for the solar-like oscillating KIC 7747078?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology provides a direct observational window into the structure and evolution of stars. While spectroscopic and photometric methods only provide information about the surface properties of stars, asteroseismology, through the analysis of oscillation frequencies, offers comprehensive information about the deep stellar interior as well as the surface. The scattering of effective temperature (Teff) determined from the spectrum and degeneracy in the Hertzsprung Russell diagram poses challenges in developing a unique interior model for a single star. Although observational asteroseismic data partially lift this degeneracy, the best model that meets all asteroseismic constraints is not obtained. Most models reported in the literature typically address the large separation Dnu constraint between oscillation frequencies, which is a critical issue, especially in post main sequence stars. Reference frequencies, influenced by helium ionisation zone induced glitches in oscillation frequencies, are instrumental in refining models. Using the high metallicity derived from the colors of the Kepler Legacy star KIC 7747078, we obtain the masses of models M as 1.208 Msun and 1.275 Msun using the reference frequencies and individual frequencies as constraints, respectively. By applying the chi2 method using these reference frequencies, Dnu, and surface metallicity determined from the spectrum, we develop a unique star model with a mass of 1.171 pm 0.019 Msun, a radius of 1.961 pm 0.011 Rsun, an effective temperature of 5993 K, an initial metallicity of 0.0121, and an age of 5.15 pm 0.29 Gyr. A significant advantage of this method is that Teff emerges as an output, not a constraint. The mixed mode oscillation frequencies of this model align well with the observations.</description>

      <title>The Role of Asteroseismology in Understanding Mass Loss in Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red giant stars play a key role in advancing our understanding of stellar mass loss. However, its initial mass and the amount of mass lost during this phase remain uncertain. In this study, we investigate the asteroseismic signatures of mass loss and the parameters that influence it. We examine six stars identified as red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APOKASC-2 catalog. Assuming these stars are on their first ascent of the RGB, we construct interior models. The resulting model ages are significantly older than the age of the Galaxy, indicating that these stars are likely experiencing mass loss and evolving toward the red clump (RC) phase. The minimum possible initial masses are estimated using the mass-metallicity diagram, from which we infer that the minimum mass lost by these stars ranges from $0.1$-$0.3{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Models constructed with an initial minimum mass yield the maximum possible age of the star. The ages of these models fall within the range of 9-9.5Gyr. For two stars, asteroseismic parameters confirm RC classification. Due to degeneracies in the HR diagram, distinguishing between internal structure models is challenging; however, asteroseismic constraints provide clear differentiation. Although mass-loss and mass-conservation models have similar $M$, $R$, and $T_{\rm eff}$ values, $\Delta\nu$s determined from the $l$=0 modes in the mass-loss models are 5-10$\%$ higher than observed. This discrepancy may arise from differences in internal structure. Finally, evolutionary model grids are used to examine how initial mass and $Z$ affect mass loss. Mass loss increases with increasing metallicity and decreases with increasing initial mass, regardless of the adopted value of $\eta$.</description>

      <title>Photometric Analysis of 30 Contact Binaries in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02993v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M31, as the largest galaxy in the Local Group, is of significant importance for the study of stellar formation and evolution. Based on the data of 5,859 targets observed in M31 by Gu et al (2024), we selected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the PHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The results show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well explained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass ratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact binaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have primary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type contact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact binary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve into compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic environments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary diagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The results show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher luminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the Milky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This may be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the solar differential rotation in solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) determined using Kanzelhoehe sunspot group positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study solar differential rotation (DR) for solar cycle No. 19 (1954-1964) by tracing sunspot groups on the sunspot drawings of Kanzelhoehe Observatory for Solar and Environmental Research (KSO). Our aim is to extend previous DR analysis from the KSO data (1964-2016) to the years prior to 1964 to create a catalog of sunspot group positions and DR parameters from KSO sunspot drawings and white light images. Synodic angular rotation velocities were first determined using the daily shift (DS) and robust linear least-squares fit (rLSQ) methods, then converted to sidereal velocities, and used to derive solar DR parameters. We compare the DR parameters obtained from different sources and analyse the north-south asymmetry of rotation for solar cycle No. 19. It has been shown that our results for the equatorial rotation velocity (parameter A) and the gradient of DR (parameter B) coincide with earlier results from the KSO data (performed with a different method), as well as with results from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) and the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). In contrast, the values of parameter A from three different earlier studies based on the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) exhibit statistically significant differences when compared to the values of parameter A derived from KSO, KoSO and YNAO. These findings suggest that the GPR data have the largest inconsistency compared to the other three data sources, highlighting the need for further analysis to identify the causes of these discrepancies. The analysis of the north-south asymmetry in the solar rotation profile using two different methods shows that the DR parameters of the hemispheres coincide, indicating a rotational symmetry around the equator. This is consistent with previous results from KSO and YNAO data. However, all sources indicate slightly higher equatorial rotation velocities in the southern hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Statistical framework for nuclear parameter uncertainties in nucleosynthesis modeling of r- and i-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating nuclear uncertainties to nucleosynthesis simulations is key to understand the impact of theoretical uncertainties on the predictions, especially for processes far from the stability region, where nuclear properties are scarcely known. While systematic (model) uncertainties have been thoroughly studied, the statistical (parameter) ones have been more rarely explored, as constraining them is more challenging. We present here a methodology to determine coherently parameter uncertainties by anchoring the theoretical uncertainties to the experimentally known nuclear properties through the use of the Backward Forward Monte Carlo method. We use this methodology for two nucleosynthesis processes: the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) and the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). We determine coherently for the i-process the uncertainties from the (n,$\gamma$) rates while we explore the impact of nuclear mass uncertainties for the r-process. The effect of parameter uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis is in the same order as model uncertainties, suggesting the crucial need for more experimental constraints on key nuclei of interest. We show how key nuclear properties, such as relevant (n,$\gamma$) rates impacting the i-process tracers, could enhance tremendously the prediction of stellar evolution models by experimentally constraining them.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the magnetic cycle of the young, active solar analogue $\iota$ Horologii ($\iota$ Hor) based on intensive spectropolarimetric monitoring using HARPSpol. Over a nearly three-year campaign, the technique of Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) was used to reconstruct 18 maps of the large-scale surface magnetic field of the star. These maps trace the evolution of the magnetic field morphology over approximately 139 stellar rotations. Our analysis uncovers pronounced temporal evolution, including multiple polarity reversals and changes in field strength and geometry. We examine the evolution of the poloidal and toroidal field components, with the toroidal component showing strong modulation in concert with the chromospheric activity. Furthermore, for the first time, we reconstruct stellar magnetic butterfly diagrams which are used to trace the migration of large-scale magnetic features across the stellar surface, determining a magnetic polarity reversal timescale of roughly 100 rotations ($\sim773$ d). In addition, by tracking the field-weighted latitudinal positions, we obtain the first estimates of the large-scale flow properties on a star other than the Sun, identifying possible pole-ward and equator-ward drift speeds for different field polarities. These results provide critical insights into the dynamo processes operating in young solar-type stars and offer a direct comparison with the solar magnetic cycle.</description>

      <title>DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, I. Modeling, evolution of individual systems, and tests</title>

Abstract: Disc instability (DI) is a model aimed at explaining the formation of companions through the fragmentation of the circumstellar gas disc. Furthermore, DI could explain the formation of part of the observed exoplanetary population. We aim to provide a new comprehensive global model for the formation of companions via DI. The latter leads for the companions to orbital migration and damping of the eccentricities and inclinations. As it evolves, the disc is continuously monitored for self-gravity and fragmentation. When the conditions are satisfied, one (or several) clumps are inserted. The evolution of the clumps is then followed in detail. We showcased the model by performing a number of simulations for various initial conditions, from simple non-fragmenting systems to complex systems with many fragments. We confirm that the DIPSY model is a comprehensive and versatile global model of companion formation via DI. It enables studies of the formation of companions with planetary to low stellar masses around primaries with final masses that range from the brown dwarf to the B-star regime. We conclude that it is necessary to consider the many interconnected processes such as gas accretion, orbital migration, and N-body interactions, as they strongly influence the inferred population of forming objects. It is also clear that model assumptions play a key role in the determination of the systems undergoing formation.</description>

      <title>DIPSY: A new Disc Instability Population SYnthesis, II. The Populations of Companions Formed Through Disc Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied the global end-to-end model described in Paper~I of this series to perform a population synthesis of companions formed via disc instability (DI). By using initial conditions compatible with both observations and hydrodynamical simulations, and by studying a large range of primary masses (0.05-5 Msol), we can provide quantitative predictions of the outcome of DI.
  In the baseline population, we find that ~10 % of the discs fragment, and about half of these end up with a surviving companion after 100 Myr. 75\% of the companions are in the brown dwarf regime, 15 % are low-mass stars, and 10 % planets. At distances larger than ~100 au, DI produces planetary-mass companions on a low percent level. Inside of 100 AU, however, planetary-mass companions are very rare (low per mill level). The average companion mass is ~30 Mj scaling weakly with stellar mass. Most of the initial fragments do not survive on a Myr timescale; they either collide with other fragments or are ejected, resulting in a population of free-floating objects (about 1-2 per star). We also quantify several variant populations to critically assess some of our assumptions used in the baseline population.
  DI appears to be a key mechanism in the formation of distant companions with masses ranging from low-mass stars down to the planetary regime, contributing, however, only marginally to planetary mass objects inside of 100 AU. Our results are sensitive to a number of physical processes, which are not completely understood. Two of them, gas accretion and clump-clump collisions, are particularly important and need to be investigated further. Magnetic fields and heavy-element accretion have not been considered in our study, although they are also expected to affect the inferred population. We suggest acknowledging the importance of the gravito-turbulent phase, which most protoplanetary discs experience.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Dynamics and Variability in Open Clusters: Insights from a Comprehensive Analysis of Six Galactic Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kinematic and dynamical analysis of six Galactic open clusters NGC~2204, NGC~2660, NGC~2262, Czernik~32, Pismis~18, and NGC~2437, using \textit{Gaia}~DR3. We used Bayesian and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods to identify cluster members, but chose GMM because it's more appropriate for low-mass stars. Estimated distances range from 1.76 to 4.20~kpc and ages from 0.199 to 1.95~Gyr, confirming their intermediate-age nature. King model fits indicate compact morphologies, with core radii of 1--10~arcmin and cluster radii of 5--24~arcmin. We identify 13 BSS and 3 YSS members, whose central concentrations suggest origins via mass transfer or stellar collisions. The mass function slopes (0.96--1.19) are flatter than the Salpeter value, which indicates that these clusters have undergone dynamical mass segregation. Orbit integration within a Galactic potential indicates nearly circular orbits (eccentricities 0.02--0.10), vertical excursions within $\pm$132~pc, and guiding radii near the solar circle, suggesting disk confinement. These clusters likely formed in the thin disk and are shaped by Galactic tidal perturbations, facilitating the rapid loss of low-mass members. Additionally, twelve variable stars were found across four clusters using \textit{TESS} light curves, including $\gamma$~Doradus and SPB pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and a yellow straggler candidate. Periods were derived via Lomb-Scargle analysis. Two eclipsing binaries (TIC~94229743 and TIC~318170024) were modeled using PHOEBE, yielding mass ratios of 1.37 and 2.16, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that integrating orbital dynamics and variable star studies presents valuable insights into the evolutionary pathways of open clusters.</description>

      <title>Foreground Extinction to Extended Celestial Objects -- I. New Extinction Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-dimensional (2D) map of total Galactic extinction, $A_\mathrm{V}$, across the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic space for Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;13$ deg, as well as a three-dimensional (3D) map of $A_\mathrm{V}$ within 2~kpc of the Sun. These maps are based on $A_\mathrm{V}$ and distance estimates derived from a dataset, which utilizes {\it Gaia} Data Release 3 parallaxes and multi-band photometry for nearly 100 million dwarf stars. We apply our own corrections to account for significant systematics in this dataset. Our 2D map achieves an angular resolution of 6.1~arcmin, while the 3D map offers a transverse resolution of 3.56~pc -- corresponding to variable angular resolution depending on distance -- and a radial resolution of 50~pc. In constructing these maps, we pay particular attention to the solar neighborhood (within 200~pc) and to high Galactic latitudes. The 3D map predicts $A_\mathrm{V}$ from the Sun to any extended object within the Galactic dust layer with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.1$~mag. The 2D map provides $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates for the entire dust half-layer up to extragalactic distances with an accuracy of $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V}) = 0.07$~mag. We provide $A_\mathrm{V}$ estimates from our maps for various classes of extended celestial objects with angular size primarily in the range of 2--40~arcmin, including 19,809 galaxies and quasars, 170 Galactic globular clusters, 458 open clusters, and several hundreds molecular clouds from two lists. We also present extinction values for 8,293 Type Ia supernovae. Comparison of our extinction estimates with those from previous maps and literature sources reveals systematic differences, indicating large-scale spatial variations in the extinction law and suggesting that earlier 2D reddening maps based on infrared dust emission tend to underestimate low extinction values.</description>

      <title>A Mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Young Stellar Objects in the SMC Region NGC 346: JWST Detects Dust, Accretion, Ices and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the low-metallicity star-forming region NGC 346 located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We conduct these integral-field-unit observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectroscopy instrument on board JWST. The brightest and most active star-forming region in the SMC, NGC 346 has a metallicity of $\sim$1/5 $Z_{\odot}$, analogous to the era when star formation in the early Universe ($z$$\simeq$2) peaked. We discuss the emission and absorption features present in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five YSOs with coverage from 4.9-27.9$\mu$m and three other sources with partial spectral coverage. Via SED model-fitting, we estimate their parameters, finding masses ranging from 2.9-18.0 M$_{\odot}$. These targets show dusty silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ices of CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH in their protostellar envelopes. We measure emission from H$_2$ and atomic fine-structure lines, suggesting the presence of protostellar jets and outflows. We detect H I lines indicating ongoing accretion and estimate accretion rates for each source which range from 2.50x10$^{-6}$-2.23x10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on H I (7-6) line emission. We present evidence for a $\sim$30,000AU protostellar jet traced by fine-structure, H I and H$_2$ emission about the YSO Y535, the first detection of a resolved protostellar outflow in the SMC, and the most distant yet detected.</description>

      <title>microJAX: A Differentiable Framework for Microlensing Modeling with GPU-Accelerated Image-Centered Ray Shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce microJAX, the first fully differentiable implementation of the image-centered ray-shooting (ICRS) algorithm for gravitational microlensing. Built on JAX and its XLA just-in-time compiler, microJAX exploits GPU parallelism while providing exact gradients through automatic differentiation. The current release supports binary- and triple-lens geometries, including limb-darkened extended-source effects, and delivers magnifications that remain differentiable for all model parameters. Benchmarks show that microJAX matches the accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\sim$5-6 speed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since the model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic programming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and variational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard microlensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to support upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while remaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate advanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise and large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent inference will be essential for maximizing scientific return.</description>

      <title>Missing Beats: Dark Matter Silences Short-Period Cepheids in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming near-infrared facilities (e.g., JWST/NIRCam, ELT/MICADO) will dramatically increase the detectability of galactic center Cepheids despite extreme extinction at optical wavelengths. In this work, we study the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on Cepheid stars in the inner parsec of the Milky Way. We show that at densities $\rho \sim 10^5 \, \text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$, blue-loop evolution can be suppressed, preventing the formation of low-mass ($3$-$6 \, M_\odot$) short-period ($1$-$6$ days) Cepheids. A dearth of such variables could provide indirect evidence for DM heating. Notably, this effect occurs at lower DM densities than required to impact main-sequence stars. Future surveys will thus offer a novel, complementary probe of DM properties in galactic nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We report the detection of HCN ($J=3-2$) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 (UT) using the $^{\prime}\overline U^{\prime}\overline u$ heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at $&gt;5\sigma$ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of $Q({\rm HCN})=(4.0\pm1.7)\times10^{25}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H$_2$O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Hunt for the mHz variability in the TESS and XMM-Newton observations of nova-like cataclysmic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analysed the flickering of selected nova-like cataclysmic variables observed by the TESS satellite and XMM-Newton. We searched for break frequencies ($f_{\rm b}$) in the corresponding power density spectra (PDS), and for any long-term evolution. We found a new optical $f_{\rm b}$ in three nova-like systems and confirmed that the value of this frequency is clustered around 1 mHz. V504 Cen and V751 Cyg show possible X-ray counterparts of $f_{\rm b}$ that had previously only been seen in MV Lyr. This points towards the very central disc for source localisation. We investigated a previously proposed correlation between white dwarf mass and $f_{\rm b}$, but thanks to the new measurements we do not conclude its existence. V3885 Sgr and V1193 Ori show flaring activity in the long-term light curve during which TESS observations were made. The corresponding PDSs show changes in shape and disappearance of $f_{\rm b}$. TT Ari and SGRt 062340.2-265715 exhibit smooth changes in the long-term optical light curve, and the corresponding TESS observations show variable $f_{\rm b}$ during these changes. $f_{\rm b}$ is higher for lower brightness, which was seen only in MV Lyr so far.</description>

      <title>HR-pyPopStar II: high spectral resolution evolutionary synthesis models low metallicity expansion and the properties of the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low metallicity stellar populations are very abundant in the Universe, either as the remnants of the past history of the Milky Way or similar spiral galaxies, or the young low metallicity stellar populations that are being observed in the local dwarf galaxies or in the high-z objects with low metal content recently found with JWST. Our goal is to develop new high-spectral-resolution models tailored for low-metallicity environments and apply them to analyse stellar population data, particularly in cases where a significant portion of the stellar content exhibits low metallicity. Methods. We used the state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis code HR-pyPopStar with available stellar libraries to create a new set of models focused on low metallicity stellar populations. We have compared the new spectral energy distributions with the previous models of HR-pyPopStar for solar metallicity. Once we verified that the spectra, except for the oldest ages that show some differences in the molecular bands of the TiO and G band, are similar, we reanalysed the high resolution data from the globular cluster M 15 by finding a better estimate of its age and metallicity. Finally, we analysed a subsample of mostly star-forming dwarf galaxies from the MaNGA survey we found similar stellar mass-mean stellar metallicity weighted by light to other studies that studied star forming dwarf galaxies and slightly higher mean stellar metallicity than the other works that analysed all types of dwarf galaxies at the same time, but are within error bars.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>An excess of luminous white dwarfs in the peculiar Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence of the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) NGC 2808 by using deep near-UV data from the Hubble Space Telescope and theoretical models, to investigate if this cluster hosts an excess of WDs. Excess in WDs is a rare phenomenon that has been found to exist only in a few GGCs. We compared star counts from different evolutionary phases on the near-UV color-magnitude diagram to evolutionary times predicted by BaSTI models. The investigation was carried out over a region within a radii of 1.5 $\arcmin$ of the cluster center and a region of similar dimension located 5$\arcmin$ away. We find a WD excess of $\approx$ 60 - 70\% when comparing star counts and evolutionary models of the WD cooling sequence to the main-sequence turn-off, and by using different values and fractions of Helium enhancement. This excess decreases to $\approx$ 30 - 40\% when the WD cooling sequence is compared to the horizontal branch. The WD excess is slightly larger in the internal field that covers the cluster center; however, the difference with the external field is compatible within the uncertainties. We argue that this excess is possibly related to the existence of SCWDs and Helium-core WDs in NGC~2808, and might be directly associated to the extended blue horizontal branch of this GGC.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Gas Dynamics of Henize 2-10: Possible Drivers of the Starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06472</link>

Abstract: The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA 21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an HI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these new observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions in astrophysical systems. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.</description>
